1
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,792
Ah, Christmas Eve in London!

2
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:50,125
- Oh!
- Who in the world could resist it?

3
00:02:24,792 --> 00:02:25,958
Whoo!

4
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:06,125
Yeah!

5
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:31,833
Kathy, the coin!

6
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,750
- Quick, Tim. Catch it!
- No.

7
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:38,208
I-I can't see it.

8
00:03:38,292 --> 00:03:40,167
Oi, ratbag!

9
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,833
Why don't you watch where you're walking,
you great clumsy lump!

10
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:53,792
Sorry, Mr. Scrooge, sir.
Didn't realize it was you.

11
00:03:59,042 --> 00:03:59,985
Good dog.

12
00:04:04,792 --> 00:04:07,000
Prudence, stop licking that poor boy.

13
00:04:07,542 --> 00:04:10,333
You've no idea where he's been.

14
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,583
Scrooge.

15
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,292
Come now, Prudence.

16
00:04:26,292 --> 00:04:27,292
Bye.

17
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:32,833
Uncle?

18
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,000
Uncle Ebenezer, is that you?

19
00:04:51,333 --> 00:04:52,750
That was close.

20
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,417
Uncle, it is you! I knew it.

21
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,958
Merry Christmas.

22
00:04:58,042 --> 00:04:59,708
And where is she?

23
00:04:59,792 --> 00:05:03,000
Where's the finest lady in all of London?

24
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,333
Prudence, girl.

25
00:05:05,417 --> 00:05:08,583
You grow more beautiful
with every passing year.

26
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:11,667
Is Uncle Scrooge
taking good care of you, is he?

27
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,750
You don't miss
that rotten old Jacob Marley too much?

28
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,292
Why, I was just on my way
to your office, Uncle.

29
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:19,917
What luck to run into you.

30
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,083
Well, Harry, they say
a man makes his own luck.

31
00:05:23,792 --> 00:05:27,542
So I suppose I only have myself
to blame for this encounter.

32
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:33,333
Out of time, Jenkins.

33
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:40,375
Good girl. Oh, yes.

34
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,458
There it is.

35
00:05:42,167 --> 00:05:44,500
Yeah, there's a good girl. Yes.

36
00:05:49,167 --> 00:05:53,000
- Care to make a donation?
- To the festive fund for the poor?

37
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:57,750
- Just enough to make Christmas merry.
- Or perhaps a little bit more?

38
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:01,417
Do you have a permit to perform here?

39
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,875
We didn't know we needed one.
Did you know we needed one?

40
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:08,375
I didn't know we needed one.
We didn't know we needed one.

41
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:10,375
Well, now you know you need one.

42
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,792
So pack up your trumpets,
before I call the police...

43
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,875
to throw you all in prison,
leaving me in peace.

44
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:22,458
Good day, ladies.

45
00:06:22,542 --> 00:06:25,458
Scrooge...

46
00:06:26,042 --> 00:06:27,027
How rude!

47
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:29,500
Uncle! Uncle!

48
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,250
Oh, splendid.

49
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,583
- Uh, here you go.
- Oh!

50
00:06:33,667 --> 00:06:36,458
Thank you very much, sir. Such generosity.

51
00:06:36,542 --> 00:06:40,500
Such generosity. Thank you very much, sir.

52
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:41,833
Think nothing of it.

53
00:06:41,917 --> 00:06:44,542
Why, who would be
uncharitable at Christmas?

54
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,875
Who indeed.

55
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,125
Uncle. Wait for us!

56
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,417
I swear I had your money in hand
yesterday, Mr. Scrooge.

57
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:59,833
It's just that my mother, she got sick,
you see, and I had to pay for a doctor.

58
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:04,208
Another fascinating story, Jenkins.
But here's a better one.

59
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:06,208
Once upon a time,

60
00:07:06,292 --> 00:07:08,333
Tom Jenkins, that's you,

61
00:07:08,417 --> 00:07:13,500
owed me, Ebenezer Scrooge, 25 pounds.

62
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:18,708
Jenkins paid the money in full,
and Scrooge lived happily ever after.

63
00:07:19,333 --> 00:07:20,458
The end.

64
00:07:20,542 --> 00:07:25,333
Oh, come on now, Mr. Scrooge, sir.
I don't have it right now,

65
00:07:25,417 --> 00:07:29,833
but I'm sure I can scrape it together
in another three, four days.

66
00:07:29,917 --> 00:07:31,083
Five. A week.

67
00:07:31,167 --> 00:07:34,250
Come on, it is Christmas after all.

68
00:07:35,667 --> 00:07:36,667
Louder.

69
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,083
Faster!

70
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,042
He's rubbish.

71
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:44,917
Christmas? Really? If only I'd known.
This changes everything.

72
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,333
Very well, in the spirit of the season,

73
00:07:47,417 --> 00:07:51,042
Mr. Tom Jenkins, you now have
until the end of Boxing Day to pay me.

74
00:07:51,542 --> 00:07:53,583
Two extra days. How does that sound?

75
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,417
Two days is better than nothing,
I suppose.

76
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,458
Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge.
Most charitable indeed.

77
00:08:00,542 --> 00:08:02,667
Father Christmas has nothing on you.

78
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,375
Ho ho ho, yes, quite.

79
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:06,792
Now, let's see.

80
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:10,917
For the inconvenience you have caused me
and the extra two days,

81
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,958
shall we say another 25 pounds?

82
00:08:15,542 --> 00:08:17,750
- That would mean I owe...
- Fifty pounds.

83
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,500
It's a good, round number,
wouldn't you agree?

84
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,542
Well, 30 is a round number too,
Mr. Scrooge.

85
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,917
You're right. But so is 60.

86
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:34,917
When you put it that way,
50 does have a better ring to it.

87
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,167
Do give my best to Mother Jenkins.

88
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,625
Oh, and Tom,

89
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,708
merry Christmas.

90
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,708
Fifty pounds. Two days.

91
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,250
Look out.

92
00:08:54,958 --> 00:08:56,125
Merry Christmas.

93
00:08:56,625 --> 00:09:00,292
- Scrooge.
- Hmm?

94
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,833
I say, Mr. Jenkins.
Do you deliver?

95
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,250
Mr. Jenkins?

96
00:09:24,542 --> 00:09:26,167
Bah, humbug.

97
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:29,500
Left a bit. Right a bit. Left a bit again.

98
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:31,250
Up. No, up.

99
00:09:31,333 --> 00:09:32,318
Left.

100
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,542
Your other left.

101
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,542
There, perfect. You're an artist, Mickey.

102
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,000
An artist would get paid more than a penny

103
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,500
for every thousand posters
he sticks up, Beryl.

104
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:45,792
You there. Yes, you. Who are you?
What do you think you're doing?

105
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:47,333
Who, us?

106
00:09:47,417 --> 00:09:50,708
Sir, we is nothing
but a bunch of poor, homeless urchins

107
00:09:50,792 --> 00:09:52,792
trying to make our way in the world.

108
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:55,833
Quick. Leg it!

109
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:02,250
Merry Christmas!

110
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:03,417
Blooming children.

111
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,708
Mr. Scrooge. Oh dear.

112
00:10:08,792 --> 00:10:11,375
Welcome back, sir.
There's something I should tell you.

113
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:14,167
The cost of that ink
will be deducted from your pay.

114
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:17,417
What? The ink?
Oh. Oh, the ink. Of course, sir, yes.

115
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,417
Get on with your work, Cratchit.

116
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,958
- If it's not too much of an inconvenience.
- But, sir...

117
00:10:22,042 --> 00:10:24,542
- I do not wish to be disturbed.
- Yes.

118
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,917
I've had more than my fill
of people for one...

119
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,375
day.

120
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:34,958
- We win!
- How in the world did you...?

121
00:10:35,042 --> 00:10:37,625
Prudence knows a shortcut, don't you?

122
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:41,042
Very well, let's get this over with then,
shall we?

123
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:44,042
How does it go again?
Oh, yes, yes, the question.

124
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:47,458
"Uncle, won't you join me
for Christmas dinner tomorrow?"

125
00:10:47,542 --> 00:10:48,542
The answer,

126
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,583
"No, Harry, I will not."

127
00:10:51,667 --> 00:10:57,458
"Christmas is a humbug.
I despise it and all it stands for."

128
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:01,417
The same answer to the same question
you ask me every year.

129
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:03,417
I have no time to be merry.

130
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:07,625
Just because my partner is dead doesn't
mean I have no business to attend to.

131
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:11,708
Quite the opposite. Jacob Marley died
seven years ago this very night,

132
00:11:11,792 --> 00:11:14,083
leaving me nothing but business.

133
00:11:14,667 --> 00:11:16,583
Oh, yes, and you.

134
00:11:16,667 --> 00:11:20,500
Oh, come now, Uncle.
Hela and I would just love to have you.

135
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,375
Hela? Who's Hela?

136
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,333
You know, Hela, my wife.

137
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:26,875
She was disappointed
you couldn't attend the wedding,

138
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:29,375
and simply can't wait to meet you.

139
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,125
So at least visit us this evening.

140
00:11:32,208 --> 00:11:34,833
Some friends and I
are gathering to toast the season.

141
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:36,833
Good day, Harry.

142
00:11:39,292 --> 00:11:44,167
Uncle, I'm all the family you have.
Why does it have to be this way?

143
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,083
I think Mother
would have been so disappointed

144
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,667
that you and I
spend every Christmas apart.

145
00:11:57,750 --> 00:12:02,708
Harry, life is full of disappointments.

146
00:12:02,792 --> 00:12:07,958
One such disappointment came
on the glorious Christmas Day

147
00:12:08,042 --> 00:12:10,458
that you stumbled into this world.

148
00:12:11,167 --> 00:12:14,333
The very same Christmas Day your mother,

149
00:12:14,417 --> 00:12:17,208
my beloved sister, left it.

150
00:12:18,792 --> 00:12:21,500
I will not be joining you
for Christmas dinner,

151
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,417
nor any other celebration
of this wretched season.

152
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,958
Now, please leave
before I say something you will regret.

153
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:41,292
Scrooge.

154
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,417
My offer still stands.
You are always welcome, Uncle.

155
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,875
- Goodbye!
- Merry Christmas, Prudence.

156
00:12:51,542 --> 00:12:53,792
- Bob.
- Merry Christmas, sir.

157
00:12:58,417 --> 00:13:00,417
Festive, ain't it?

158
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:10,542
Excuse me, sir,
but it's almost 6:00. Six o'clock.

159
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,625
Could I trouble you for my wages, please?

160
00:13:14,458 --> 00:13:16,458
Cratchit, Cratchit, Cratchit...

161
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,125
you do nothing but trouble me.

162
00:13:21,208 --> 00:13:24,292
Yeah.

163
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:27,667
Five, 10, 15 shillings.

164
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,250
- Thank you, sir.
- Take away five.

165
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:32,500
But I'm owed 15.

166
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:35,375
Consider the other five
your payment to me.

167
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,375
- For what, sir?
- The ink, of course.

168
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,417
And the day off
you insist on taking tomorrow.

169
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:44,167
Well, sir, it is Christmas.

170
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:48,250
Yes, as everyone is so fond of telling me.

171
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:52,208
Sir, this isn't enough.
My family, you see, my children...

172
00:13:52,292 --> 00:13:54,208
My... My boy needs medicine.

173
00:13:54,292 --> 00:13:55,375
You have children?

174
00:13:55,875 --> 00:13:57,083
Of course you do.

175
00:13:57,583 --> 00:14:03,708
Cratchit, times are hard.
And my financial burdens are considerable.

176
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:08,375
Now should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?

177
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,458
- Scrooge...
- Does that sound fair to you?

178
00:14:11,542 --> 00:14:12,485
No, sir.

179
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,750
No, sir, indeed.
Now, let's get you on your way, shall we?

180
00:14:16,833 --> 00:14:21,000
- Merry Christmas, Mr. Scrooge.
- Yes, yes. Ding-dong, merrily.

181
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:24,833
I expect you
at half past seven on Boxing Day.

182
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:28,417
What? What have I done now?

183
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:40,083
Why, if it isn't the amazing
and wonderful Cratchit children!

184
00:14:40,167 --> 00:14:41,208
Father!

185
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,083
- Tim!
- Father, help!

186
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:50,083
It's all right, my little man.
Just breathe, slowly.

187
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:53,083
He's getting worse.

188
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,875
That's it. There you go.

189
00:14:59,917 --> 00:15:03,250
Right, you two.
That's it, no more busking tonight.

190
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:07,625
It's freezing out here,
and you need your rest, young man.

191
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,652
Aw.

192
00:15:08,667 --> 00:15:13,792
- But we've only made ten pence ha'penny.
- Ten pence ha'penny? A bumper windfall!

193
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:17,583
If we add that to the ten shillings
I happen to have in my pocket

194
00:15:17,667 --> 00:15:19,875
and throw in a bit of Cratchit magic,

195
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:24,792
I reckon we can have as fine a Christmas
as the Lord Mayor himself.

196
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,750
- Yay!
- Just wait and see.

197
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,500
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

198
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,917
I'll pick up a juicy bone for you
on the way home. How does that sound?

199
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,792
The butcher owes me seven pounds six...

200
00:15:55,708 --> 00:15:57,750
so I'm sure he'll be happy to oblige.

201
00:16:02,917 --> 00:16:06,208
Scrooge...

202
00:16:07,292 --> 00:16:08,292
No?

203
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:10,292
No pleasing some people.

204
00:16:16,292 --> 00:16:20,042
You there. What do you think
you're doing?

205
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:27,000
Oh, bravo!

206
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:28,750
There you go.

207
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,083
Merry Christmas.

208
00:16:51,417 --> 00:16:52,458
You two!

209
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,083
Clear off!

210
00:16:54,542 --> 00:16:55,583
Disgusting.

211
00:16:57,375 --> 00:17:01,292
Ebenezer Scrooge...

212
00:17:52,667 --> 00:17:53,667
Tell me.

213
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,500
There you go, sir.

214
00:18:22,792 --> 00:18:24,625
Scrooge.

215
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:26,833
Tell me!

216
00:19:26,917 --> 00:19:27,917
Ahh!

217
00:19:35,542 --> 00:19:39,625
Ebenezer Scrooge.

218
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:44,708
Ebenezer Scrooge.

219
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:49,667
Ebenezer Scrooge.

220
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,917
Ebenezer Scrooge.

221
00:20:58,292 --> 00:21:00,208
J-J-J-Jacob Marley?

222
00:21:01,167 --> 00:21:03,458
Impossible. You're dead.

223
00:21:04,042 --> 00:21:05,042
Dead?

224
00:21:05,792 --> 00:21:08,667
Dead tired!

225
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:09,875
Oh.

226
00:21:14,875 --> 00:21:17,333
Oh, yeah. How embarrassing.

227
00:21:19,167 --> 00:21:23,500
Prudence. Oh, how well you look.

228
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:26,125
I knew leaving you
in the care of Uncle Scrooge

229
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:29,042
was the right thing to do? Didn't I?

230
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:32,667
Hmm? Yes, I did. I did.

231
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:36,917
I do apologize
for the dramatic entrance, old boy.

232
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,500
Those in charge
insist on a touch of pageantry.

233
00:21:40,583 --> 00:21:42,292
Goes with the territory, you see.

234
00:21:42,792 --> 00:21:46,958
But I'm sure you and I can discuss
the rest like reasonable men.

235
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:52,375
Ah, I must have drifted off by the fire.

236
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,000
I'm dreaming.

237
00:21:54,417 --> 00:21:58,458
Serves me right
for eating cheese so close to bedtime.

238
00:21:59,833 --> 00:22:00,833
Well,

239
00:22:00,917 --> 00:22:02,042
very well.

240
00:22:16,792 --> 00:22:18,083
Ye gods!

241
00:22:18,167 --> 00:22:20,167
Listen well, Scrooge.

242
00:22:20,667 --> 00:22:22,292
This is no dream.

243
00:22:22,375 --> 00:22:25,042
Look upon the chain that binds me.

244
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:29,917
In life, I forged it,
link by link, yard by yard.

245
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,833
It grew to match my greed.

246
00:22:32,917 --> 00:22:36,542
In death, I will never be rid of it.

247
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:38,542
Nor will you yours.

248
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:40,167
Mine?

249
00:22:40,250 --> 00:22:41,917
Yes, yours.

250
00:22:55,833 --> 00:22:57,708
We were all like you.

251
00:22:58,208 --> 00:23:01,500
Trapped in our own selfish worlds.

252
00:23:01,583 --> 00:23:04,417
We never reached out
to our fellow men in life,

253
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:07,625
so are condemned to do so in death.

254
00:23:08,208 --> 00:23:11,625
We have watched you many a day, Scrooge.

255
00:23:11,708 --> 00:23:16,875
Watched your chain grow,
link by link, yard by yard.

256
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:21,250
But you may yet escape our fate.

257
00:23:21,875 --> 00:23:25,083
I have pulled a few chains

258
00:23:25,167 --> 00:23:29,917
and arranged for three visitors
to call on you before morning.

259
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:33,125
The first, when the bell tolls 1:00.

260
00:23:33,208 --> 00:23:35,625
The second, at 2:00.

261
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,208
And the third, at...

262
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,292
Well, 3:00.

263
00:23:45,875 --> 00:23:49,500
Listen to these visitors. Learn from them.

264
00:23:49,583 --> 00:23:51,708
And heed my warning

265
00:23:52,792 --> 00:23:56,125
before it's too late.

266
00:24:30,417 --> 00:24:31,917
Jacob Marley

267
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:35,458
concerned for someone else's well-being?

268
00:24:35,542 --> 00:24:37,708
Well, it must have been a dream.

269
00:24:43,833 --> 00:24:44,833
Huh?

270
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,417
Humbug.

271
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:05,500
It's that nephew of mine. Interfering.
Bringing my blood to the boil.

272
00:25:05,583 --> 00:25:08,500
Has me jumping at shadows.
Seeing things. Yes.

273
00:25:08,583 --> 00:25:10,000
That's it. Yes.

274
00:25:13,333 --> 00:25:15,958
The first, at 1:00.

275
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:31,417
Hmm.

276
00:26:22,125 --> 00:26:23,375
Hello?

277
00:26:33,417 --> 00:26:34,583
Oh, hello.

278
00:26:34,667 --> 00:26:37,000
It's Scrooge, isn't it?

279
00:26:37,083 --> 00:26:40,542
Yes, that's the one, Scrooge.
What a funny name.

280
00:26:40,625 --> 00:26:42,750
Are you comfortable down there, Scrooge?

281
00:26:42,833 --> 00:26:44,958
Uh, well...

282
00:26:45,042 --> 00:26:46,375
Never mind that.

283
00:26:46,875 --> 00:26:50,208
Who, or what, are you?

284
00:26:50,792 --> 00:26:53,292
And it's "Mr. Scrooge," if you please.

285
00:26:53,375 --> 00:26:56,750
Well, Mr. Scrooge-if-you-please, who am I?

286
00:26:56,833 --> 00:27:00,833
I can be anyone you have ever known.
I can even be you.

287
00:27:03,167 --> 00:27:05,167
Bah, humbugs.

288
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:07,083
Christmas is an outrage.

289
00:27:07,167 --> 00:27:09,208
Grr, give me your money.

290
00:27:09,292 --> 00:27:12,167
- Interest rates, and so on.
- Hmm.

291
00:27:12,667 --> 00:27:14,250
You were not told of my coming?

292
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:16,875
No? No matter.

293
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:22,625
You have nothing to fear from me.
After all, your welfare is my business.

294
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:27,917
Miss, to be disturbed at this hour
is hardly conducive to my welfare.

295
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,125
Your redemption, then.

296
00:27:30,875 --> 00:27:33,750
You see, an old friend of yours

297
00:27:33,833 --> 00:27:37,625
asked me to illuminate
a thing or two for you. I...

298
00:27:37,708 --> 00:27:39,375
Illuminate what, exactly?

299
00:27:39,958 --> 00:27:43,625
I was getting to that.
You are an impatient one.

300
00:27:44,125 --> 00:27:47,625
I will show you the past.

301
00:27:47,708 --> 00:27:49,583
Christmas past.

302
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:54,125
Specifically, your Christmas past. Ahh!

303
00:27:55,667 --> 00:27:57,250
There. Much better.

304
00:27:58,667 --> 00:27:59,875
I've gone mad.

305
00:28:00,708 --> 00:28:01,875
Mad, you say?

306
00:28:02,583 --> 00:28:05,500
Jacob Marley floating in my sitting room.

307
00:28:05,583 --> 00:28:08,875
Faces etched in frost.
Whispers in the wind.

308
00:28:08,958 --> 00:28:11,167
A blizzard indoors.

309
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:15,208
Now you, a talking waxwork
with a wick for brains.

310
00:28:15,292 --> 00:28:18,458
My dreams are never this... exciting.

311
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:22,917
And none of this can be real.
So, yes, I must be awake,

312
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,833
but quite insane.

313
00:28:25,542 --> 00:28:30,042
Well, I may have wick for brains,
but I do think I'm real.

314
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,208
Here.

315
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,833
Oh, hush now.

316
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,583
There, did that feel real?

317
00:28:35,667 --> 00:28:36,958
I-I suppose it did.

318
00:28:37,875 --> 00:28:39,625
It hurt too.

319
00:28:39,708 --> 00:28:43,458
Yes, the past can hurt.
Especially yours.

320
00:28:43,542 --> 00:28:46,375
But it can also heal,
if you learn from it.

321
00:28:46,458 --> 00:28:48,917
- Now, come with me.
- Absolutely not.

322
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:51,625
I refuse to go anywhere...

323
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:53,333
Whee!

324
00:28:53,417 --> 00:28:55,500
Whoo!

325
00:28:56,167 --> 00:28:57,333
Yeah!

326
00:29:02,458 --> 00:29:03,625
No, no!

327
00:29:08,583 --> 00:29:10,333
Whee!

328
00:29:19,375 --> 00:29:21,042
Whoo!

329
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:35,292
Oh, baby Scrooge!

330
00:29:38,042 --> 00:29:40,792
No!

331
00:29:47,750 --> 00:29:52,125
Whoo-hoo!

332
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,292
Where? W-What? Who?

333
00:30:10,542 --> 00:30:11,667
Get off!

334
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:24,375
Sorry, it does take its toll
going this far back.

335
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:27,458
- Did I not warn you?
- No, you certainly...

336
00:30:27,542 --> 00:30:30,500
Wait, what do you mean by "back"?

337
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:34,875
Huh?

338
00:30:42,292 --> 00:30:46,042
- What...?
- We're not quite there yet.

339
00:30:46,125 --> 00:30:48,167
Almost.

340
00:30:50,208 --> 00:30:51,417
Here we are.

341
00:30:52,583 --> 00:30:54,750
The past.

342
00:30:56,125 --> 00:30:57,958
Spooky!

343
00:31:13,875 --> 00:31:15,500
I know this place.

344
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:19,625
It was demolished years ago.
I saw to that.

345
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:25,875
You there. What day is it?

346
00:31:26,375 --> 00:31:28,083
I say...

347
00:31:31,708 --> 00:31:32,708
Ah! Oh! Oh!

348
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:36,792
I wouldn't do that.
You can't interfere with anything here.

349
00:31:36,875 --> 00:31:40,292
And nobody can hear you.
Or see you, for that matter.

350
00:31:54,417 --> 00:31:57,167
- Don't fill it right to the top.
- Look!

351
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:03,375
Young Ebenezer Scrooge,
hard at work on Christmas Eve.

352
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:05,792
Not very festive, is it?

353
00:32:06,833 --> 00:32:07,735
I...

354
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:09,250
I-I had no choice.

355
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:14,500
You see, without the modest income
I provided, my mother and sister,

356
00:32:15,083 --> 00:32:16,708
th-they would have starved.

357
00:32:17,292 --> 00:32:20,042
- Did your father not have any money?
- My father?

358
00:32:20,542 --> 00:32:21,875
He was not a poor man,

359
00:32:22,375 --> 00:32:25,375
but the fool spent his way
into debtors' prison.

360
00:32:26,667 --> 00:32:28,708
Oh, I see.

361
00:32:28,792 --> 00:32:32,958
Debtors' prison. Terrible, terrible thing,
a debtors' prison.

362
00:32:33,875 --> 00:32:37,375
- What is a debtors' prison again?
- A debtors' prison is, uh...

363
00:32:38,625 --> 00:32:40,125
None of your business.

364
00:32:54,875 --> 00:32:57,958
You can't escape your past, mate.

365
00:32:58,917 --> 00:32:59,902
Now, look here...

366
00:33:30,417 --> 00:33:32,708
My dear little sister, Jen.

367
00:33:55,708 --> 00:33:58,917
Jen. Come on, breathe.

368
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,000
Slowly.

369
00:34:00,042 --> 00:34:02,375
In and out.

370
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,250
That's it.

371
00:34:06,167 --> 00:34:07,833
What are you doing here alone?

372
00:34:08,333 --> 00:34:11,458
- Does Mother know you're out?
- I wanted to give you this.

373
00:34:11,542 --> 00:34:13,750
I made it all by myself.

374
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:18,917
- Merry Christmas, Ebenezer.
- Oh, Jen. It's Father Christmas.

375
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,667
He's really magnificent.

376
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,833
Maybe you could help me
make one for you in return.

377
00:34:24,917 --> 00:34:27,125
Yes, please!

378
00:34:27,208 --> 00:34:29,542
Shall we sing
that pretty song of yours as we walk?

379
00:34:41,583 --> 00:34:45,125
Oh, such a sweet child.
Will she be all right?

380
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:49,542
She will be. For a while, at least,
the sickness will not take her.

381
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:52,125
My father paid his debts, eventually.

382
00:34:52,208 --> 00:34:55,292
We found the right doctor
and she was saved. But...

383
00:34:55,375 --> 00:34:56,583
But?

384
00:34:56,667 --> 00:35:00,375
She remained a delicate soul,
whom a breath might have withered.

385
00:35:00,917 --> 00:35:05,542
Jen died in childbirth.
My idiot nephew in exchange for my sister.

386
00:35:05,625 --> 00:35:10,083
A sorry transaction in any currency.
And all on Christmas Day.

387
00:35:10,167 --> 00:35:11,167
Christmas.

388
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:13,667
Oof. Humbug.

389
00:35:14,167 --> 00:35:15,458
Oh, come now.

390
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:18,083
Is there not one Christmas
you remember fondly?

391
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:24,042
One buried, perhaps,
in a hole as deep as old Marley's grave?

392
00:35:26,708 --> 00:35:28,167
- Hmm?
- Hmm.

393
00:35:30,792 --> 00:35:33,125
Merry Christmas, sir.

394
00:35:35,917 --> 00:35:37,250
Hello, Uncle.

395
00:35:43,708 --> 00:35:44,917
Aha!

396
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,125
I do believe I've found one.

397
00:35:47,208 --> 00:35:48,667
Mr. Fezziwig.

398
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:52,875
"Fizzywig?" Why, that's almost
as silly as "Scrooge."

399
00:35:54,458 --> 00:35:55,625
Off we go.

400
00:35:55,708 --> 00:35:57,875
- A little jump forward this time.
- Wait...

401
00:36:04,042 --> 00:36:07,875
I'm home then.
And not before time.

402
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:11,917
Very well. You have a week and no more.

403
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,375
Or we shall both
have to find new employment.

404
00:36:15,042 --> 00:36:18,208
- Good day.
- Thank you very much, Mr. Scrooge.

405
00:36:18,292 --> 00:36:20,833
God bless ya.
And a merry Christmas when it comes.

406
00:36:20,917 --> 00:36:23,500
It's still the past.

407
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:24,485
It is.

408
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:28,417
My word, you were
a handsome chap, Scrooge.

409
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:29,750
What went wrong?

410
00:36:31,875 --> 00:36:33,125
Ebenezer?

411
00:36:33,208 --> 00:36:34,667
Is that you, lad?

412
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,792
- Mr. Fezziwig?
- It is you!

413
00:36:36,875 --> 00:36:38,875
Wonderful to see you, my boy.

414
00:36:38,958 --> 00:36:40,875
So that's Mr. Wizzyfig.

415
00:36:41,542 --> 00:36:46,125
Fezziwig. Yes, I used to work
in his warehouse before Marley took me on.

416
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:48,208
Why didn't you keep working for him?

417
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,875
Marley offered a position
with more security.

418
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:52,667
People will always need money.

419
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:56,458
If I'd stayed, I would only have been
Fezziwig's lowly apprentice.

420
00:36:56,542 --> 00:37:00,250
I had to better myself
before even thinking of proposing to her.

421
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:01,833
Proposing?

422
00:37:01,917 --> 00:37:04,875
Oh, I do like a wedding.
Who's her? Where's her?

423
00:37:04,958 --> 00:37:05,958
Flora!

424
00:37:06,708 --> 00:37:07,708
Isabel.

425
00:37:09,250 --> 00:37:10,193
Yes, Father?

426
00:37:12,417 --> 00:37:13,417
- Isabel.
- Isabel.

427
00:37:14,375 --> 00:37:15,917
Look who I found!

428
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:19,542
Ebenezer! How lovely to see you.

429
00:37:20,542 --> 00:37:22,333
My, you look splendid in your suit.

430
00:37:22,833 --> 00:37:25,958
- Although, do you mind?
- I... I...

431
00:37:27,292 --> 00:37:28,583
- That is...
- There.

432
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,833
- You see...
- Perfect.

433
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:32,917
Thank you.

434
00:37:35,125 --> 00:37:37,667
Oh, Isabel, how I love thee.

435
00:37:37,750 --> 00:37:42,208
With thy big slobbery face
and stinking dog breath.

436
00:37:44,708 --> 00:37:45,917
Oh! Oh.

437
00:37:46,417 --> 00:37:50,958
Uh, Ebenezer, do you have
any plans for tomorrow?

438
00:37:51,042 --> 00:37:54,500
- Tomorrow, sir?
- You know, Christmas Day, my boy!

439
00:37:54,583 --> 00:37:57,583
No, sir. My sister
is with her husband in Kent.

440
00:37:57,667 --> 00:38:00,125
They're expecting a child any day now.

441
00:38:00,208 --> 00:38:03,083
She invited me to visit,
but I had to decline.

442
00:38:03,167 --> 00:38:04,875
Then it's decided!

443
00:38:04,958 --> 00:38:08,417
You'll join us
for Christmas lunch tomorrow.

444
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:09,875
I'm not sure I can.

445
00:38:09,958 --> 00:38:13,375
Too much still to be done, and Mr. Marley
doesn't even take the day himself.

446
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,833
Say you'll come, Ebenezer.
It'll be such fun.

447
00:38:16,667 --> 00:38:18,125
Oh, look away.

448
00:38:19,208 --> 00:38:20,208
I, uh...

449
00:38:21,417 --> 00:38:22,917
I'll talk to Mr. Marley.

450
00:38:23,917 --> 00:38:26,958
- Did you go?
- Well, it would have been rude not to.

451
00:38:27,042 --> 00:38:28,292
I felt obliged.

452
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:30,292
I see.

453
00:38:30,375 --> 00:38:31,458
See you there.

454
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:33,042
But you didn't enjoy it?

455
00:38:34,417 --> 00:38:36,333
No. Not one bit.

456
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:50,125
Oh my goodness.

457
00:38:51,792 --> 00:38:54,292
You look like you're having an awful time.

458
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,708
Uh, yes.

459
00:41:32,292 --> 00:41:34,000
A delightful woman.

460
00:41:35,875 --> 00:41:36,875
Without her,

461
00:41:37,708 --> 00:41:41,167
Jen's death would have taken
an even greater toll on me.

462
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:43,083
You married her, yes?

463
00:41:43,667 --> 00:41:45,583
No. Not quite. I...

464
00:41:45,667 --> 00:41:46,708
No?

465
00:41:46,792 --> 00:41:49,958
- I would very much like to see why not.
- No!

466
00:41:56,458 --> 00:41:57,458
I...

467
00:41:57,542 --> 00:41:59,875
I do wish you would stop doing that.

468
00:42:01,583 --> 00:42:03,333
Home. Finally.

469
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:06,708
Well, goodbye, whatever you are.

470
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:09,875
I would say it's been a pleasure,
but it hasn't.

471
00:42:11,458 --> 00:42:12,458
Where's my name?

472
00:42:18,250 --> 00:42:20,917
This is before Marley made me a partner.

473
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:24,083
Ebenezer? Hello?

474
00:42:24,167 --> 00:42:26,250
- I'm still in the past.
- Hello?

475
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,750
Oh, you do catch on quickly, don't you?

476
00:42:37,833 --> 00:42:41,458
Ebenezer? Are you there?
I brought some lunch.

477
00:42:41,542 --> 00:42:44,500
I see so little of you these days,
so I thought...

478
00:42:45,333 --> 00:42:47,833
I'm not sure what I thought.

479
00:42:52,375 --> 00:42:54,208
Ah, lovely Isabel.

480
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:57,292
- But you said you didn't marry her?
- We are...

481
00:42:58,292 --> 00:43:01,875
Were merely engaged. For quite some time.

482
00:43:01,958 --> 00:43:05,792
I see. I thought you would have
gone back to work for Wiggyfiz?

483
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:07,125
Of course not!

484
00:43:07,208 --> 00:43:10,792
His charity would have led to the same
ruination that befell my family.

485
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:13,333
"His charity would have led
to the same ruination

486
00:43:13,417 --> 00:43:15,583
that befell my blah, blah, blah."

487
00:43:17,083 --> 00:43:20,583
I needed more security
than he could offer. We needed it.

488
00:43:20,667 --> 00:43:24,500
I saw them by the baker's
only a few minutes ago. Good day.

489
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:32,583
Lead on, Scrooge.
Lead on. Allons-y.

490
00:43:34,833 --> 00:43:39,042
Please, Mr. Marley, sir.
This is my livelihood. My home.

491
00:43:39,125 --> 00:43:41,667
My family will starve. Just one more week.

492
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:44,542
One more day,
and I'll have your money, I swear.

493
00:43:44,625 --> 00:43:47,250
You've had three weeks already.
I am sorry.

494
00:43:47,333 --> 00:43:50,708
No. No apologies, Ebenezer.

495
00:43:50,792 --> 00:43:55,917
Times are hard,
and my financial burdens are considerable.

496
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:00,875
Should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?

497
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,042
Does that sound fair to you?

498
00:44:03,125 --> 00:44:05,417
- Sir, it's Christmas Eve.
- Come on.

499
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:07,417
Please, show some mercy.

500
00:44:07,500 --> 00:44:10,792
- Where are you taking him?
- Clear off. Go on. On your way!

501
00:44:14,750 --> 00:44:17,125
and my financial burdens
are considerable.

502
00:44:17,208 --> 00:44:22,208
Now should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?

503
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:24,458
Does that sound fair to you, Cratchit?

504
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:27,917
I... I don't recall this at all.

505
00:44:28,750 --> 00:44:31,917
I'm not surprised.
As horrible as this situation is,

506
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:34,875
I'm sure it was of great financial benefit
to you and Marley.

507
00:44:34,958 --> 00:44:37,500
Apart from the delightful Miss Fizzlejig,

508
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:40,208
you only seem to remember encounters
where you lose money.

509
00:44:40,292 --> 00:44:44,542
You dwell on the bad things in life,
and then learn nothing from them.

510
00:44:44,625 --> 00:44:45,917
Does Cratchit know?

511
00:44:46,583 --> 00:44:49,417
Why would he choose to work for me?
After what I...

512
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,250
If his father had only paid his debts...

513
00:44:53,917 --> 00:44:55,500
It's not my fault.

514
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:58,750
Isabel.

515
00:45:01,792 --> 00:45:04,042
She saw all of this.

516
00:45:23,333 --> 00:45:24,417
Ebenezer.

517
00:45:26,333 --> 00:45:27,750
Can I talk to you?

518
00:45:28,417 --> 00:45:29,417
Alone.

519
00:45:30,458 --> 00:45:32,375
Not now, Isabel.

520
00:45:32,458 --> 00:45:34,500
I have far too much work.

521
00:45:34,583 --> 00:45:35,792
Later, later.

522
00:45:37,083 --> 00:45:39,583
I'll, uh, leave you two lovebirds to it.

523
00:45:39,667 --> 00:45:41,583
Come, Boris.

524
00:45:54,417 --> 00:45:55,417
No.

525
00:49:40,958 --> 00:49:41,958
Ebenezer?

526
00:49:42,375 --> 00:49:43,792
Some assistance, please.

527
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,000
Yes, Jacob, coming.

528
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:48,542
Later, Isabel.

529
00:49:50,417 --> 00:49:51,417
No!

530
00:49:51,833 --> 00:49:53,917
There is no "later!"

531
00:49:59,833 --> 00:50:00,958
Goodbye, Ebenezer.

532
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:17,333
Oh, look.
A wee glimpse into Isabel's future.

533
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:19,625
Oh, she looks so happy.

534
00:50:19,708 --> 00:50:21,625
And her husband's gorgeous.

535
00:50:22,125 --> 00:50:27,333
That... That could have been you, I suppose.
Oh, too bad, Scrooge. Too bad.

536
00:50:27,417 --> 00:50:31,417
Why show me all of this now?
What's done is done. I can't go back.

537
00:50:32,042 --> 00:50:35,458
When we were financially secure,
I would have married her...

538
00:50:35,542 --> 00:50:36,542
eventually.

539
00:50:37,250 --> 00:50:38,333
Wouldn't I?

540
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:40,208
I don't know.

541
00:50:46,583 --> 00:50:48,292
Bye!

542
00:50:52,083 --> 00:50:53,167
Take me back.

543
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:55,500
Take me back!

544
00:50:55,583 --> 00:50:57,375
I'm afraid I can't.

545
00:50:57,458 --> 00:51:00,625
There is no going back,
nor changing what has been.

546
00:51:00,708 --> 00:51:02,125
You said so yourself.

547
00:51:02,625 --> 00:51:07,083
You can't change the past,
but you can learn from it.

548
00:51:07,167 --> 00:51:10,625
For your own sake, I hope you do, Scrooge.

549
00:51:10,708 --> 00:51:12,708
- Ooh.
- No, no, no, no!

550
00:51:13,333 --> 00:51:16,042
Whoo! It really is time to go.

551
00:51:17,292 --> 00:51:18,542
Farewell, Scrooge.

552
00:51:19,125 --> 00:51:21,125
Farewell.

553
00:51:21,708 --> 00:51:24,167
No, please! Don't leave me here!

554
00:51:24,250 --> 00:51:25,333
I must.

555
00:51:25,417 --> 00:51:28,458
Ooh. I have shown you what was.

556
00:51:28,542 --> 00:51:31,333
Now another will show you what is.

557
00:51:31,417 --> 00:51:32,458
Oh. Ooh.

558
00:51:32,542 --> 00:51:35,125
Remember what you have seen, Scrooge.

559
00:51:35,208 --> 00:51:37,292
Remember. Learn.

560
00:51:37,875 --> 00:51:43,167
Change while you still can!

561
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:48,750
The second, at 2:00.

562
00:52:22,625 --> 00:52:23,625
Hello?

563
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:26,917
Is there anybody there?

564
00:52:30,667 --> 00:52:33,375
Strange, annoying,
candle lady thing?

565
00:52:34,083 --> 00:52:35,083
Hello?

566
00:52:38,208 --> 00:52:39,193
Huh?

567
00:53:05,250 --> 00:53:09,208
Who dares disturb my slumber?

568
00:53:13,667 --> 00:53:18,042
State thy name and business, puny mortal.

569
00:53:21,333 --> 00:53:23,042
I can't...

570
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,750
I can't... I can't keep it up.

571
00:53:25,250 --> 00:53:26,750
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

572
00:53:26,833 --> 00:53:28,958
It was her. She dared me.

573
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:31,375
Oh, we do like to have fun here.

574
00:53:36,208 --> 00:53:37,208
Don't worry.

575
00:53:38,042 --> 00:53:40,167
I know who you are.

576
00:53:40,250 --> 00:53:43,458
Come on, bring it in,
Ebenezer Scrooge. Bring it in!

577
00:53:43,542 --> 00:53:46,583
Welcome, my friend. Welcome.

578
00:53:46,667 --> 00:53:48,125
Welcome where?

579
00:53:48,208 --> 00:53:49,208
Where am I?

580
00:53:49,792 --> 00:53:51,167
When am I?

581
00:53:51,750 --> 00:53:55,542
Oh, you are in the here and now.
In the present!

582
00:53:55,625 --> 00:53:57,833
Isn't it just fabulous?

583
00:54:00,833 --> 00:54:02,417
It's fine, I suppose.

584
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:04,833
From here, I can go anywhere I please.

585
00:54:04,917 --> 00:54:07,875
Just so long as it's happening right now.

586
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,958
And I do so love to visit

587
00:54:10,042 --> 00:54:14,042
your teeny-tiny, tootsy-wootsy,
little planet at this time of year.

588
00:54:14,125 --> 00:54:17,625
So much love, generosity, and good cheer!

589
00:54:18,458 --> 00:54:23,583
Which, conversely, brings me to you.

590
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:25,917
- Me?
- Yes, you.

591
00:54:28,083 --> 00:54:32,083
Squeezing, wrenching, grasping,
clutching, covetous you!

592
00:54:35,083 --> 00:54:39,625
Secret and solitary as an oyster,
you edge along the crowded paths of life

593
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:41,625
keeping everyone at a distance.

594
00:54:43,000 --> 00:54:49,208
Why, you stopped truly living your life
so long ago, you might as well be dead.

595
00:54:49,292 --> 00:54:51,583
Do not presume
to tell me how to live my life.

596
00:54:52,083 --> 00:54:53,500
I lead a good life.

597
00:54:55,042 --> 00:54:56,542
I'm a good man.

598
00:54:56,625 --> 00:54:59,333
Ha! "A good man," he says.

599
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,500
Uh, uh, uh.

600
00:56:20,083 --> 00:56:20,985
Whoo!

601
00:57:29,417 --> 00:57:31,375
Do you see the light?

602
00:57:31,458 --> 00:57:33,542
Can you feel it, Scrooge?

603
00:57:34,042 --> 00:57:37,500
Are you ready to live your life,
now, in the present,

604
00:57:37,583 --> 00:57:40,333
unencumbered by the weight of the past?

605
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:45,917
I'm ready.

606
00:57:50,125 --> 00:57:53,667
I'm ready to go home. Thank you very much.

607
00:57:56,833 --> 00:57:57,833
Oh, really?

608
00:57:58,792 --> 00:58:02,625
But the fireworks.
We did a whole song and everything.

609
00:58:02,708 --> 00:58:06,167
Well, I'm not giving up on you yet,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

610
00:58:07,375 --> 00:58:09,542
Come on. Let's hit the town.

611
00:58:09,625 --> 00:58:12,458
Hit the town?
I'll hit something else in a minute.

612
00:58:13,042 --> 00:58:15,833
Dragged from pillar to post
in the middle of the night. Huh.

613
00:58:29,042 --> 00:58:33,083
My friends, please.
I-I would like to propose a toast.

614
00:58:33,167 --> 00:58:35,042
My friends, please. Oh...

615
00:58:36,458 --> 00:58:37,458
Oh, thank you.

616
00:58:37,542 --> 00:58:40,375
He really is a buffoon, that boy.

617
00:58:40,458 --> 00:58:42,542
There's no need to whisper.

618
00:58:42,625 --> 00:58:45,458
No one can hear or see you.

619
00:58:45,542 --> 00:58:47,542
Lucky them.

620
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:52,625
Please raise your glass
and drink to the good health and long life

621
00:58:52,708 --> 00:58:55,875
of my celebrated uncle, Ebenezer Scrooge.

622
00:58:55,958 --> 00:58:57,667
Boo.

623
00:58:57,750 --> 00:59:00,375
I know. I know.

624
00:59:00,958 --> 00:59:02,583
But I like old Scrooge.

625
00:59:03,292 --> 00:59:07,500
- No, no, no. No. Come now. I do. I do.
- Why?

626
00:59:07,583 --> 00:59:08,583
Why?

627
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:12,708
I never met my mother,
but my father spoke of her often.

628
00:59:12,792 --> 00:59:15,958
Of her kindness. Her generosity.

629
00:59:16,042 --> 00:59:18,208
It's hard to believe
that the woman he described

630
00:59:18,292 --> 00:59:21,583
was that old stick-in-the-mud's
little sister.

631
00:59:21,667 --> 00:59:23,583
But his sister she was.

632
00:59:23,667 --> 00:59:26,917
And, by all accounts,
she and my uncle were inseparable.

633
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:30,208
She loved him without reservation,
and he, her.

634
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:31,958
So he can't be all bad.

635
00:59:32,042 --> 00:59:36,583
I have to believe that somewhere
in that loathsome old carcass of his,

636
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:39,917
the man my mother loved
is fighting to get out.

637
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:41,708
I should like to meet him one day.

638
00:59:42,458 --> 00:59:47,042
Which brings me to my next toast
of the evening, to my beloved mother.

639
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:50,250
As I entered the world, you departed.

640
00:59:50,333 --> 00:59:56,458
Here's to the Christmases we never shared,
and the sad, short one we did.

641
01:00:03,292 --> 01:00:05,917
Harry, my dear, sweet Harry,

642
01:00:06,417 --> 01:00:08,917
let's not dwell
on the sadness in our past,

643
01:00:09,000 --> 01:00:10,833
on those who cannot be with us.

644
01:00:11,333 --> 01:00:14,042
Or refuse to be.

645
01:00:14,125 --> 01:00:17,708
Instead, let us celebrate
those who are here.

646
01:00:17,792 --> 01:00:18,958
Hear! Hear!

647
01:00:20,875 --> 01:00:25,458
Everyone, let us honor the past
by toasting our present.

648
01:00:25,542 --> 01:00:27,583
To each other. To Christmas.

649
01:00:27,667 --> 01:00:29,750
- To friendship.
- Hear! Hear!

650
01:00:29,833 --> 01:00:31,792
- To friendship.
- To friendship.

651
01:00:32,583 --> 01:00:33,708
To friendship.

652
01:00:34,208 --> 01:00:35,250
Bravo!

653
01:00:49,083 --> 01:00:52,167
Oh, for goodness' sake,
where are we going now?

654
01:00:54,375 --> 01:00:57,042
May I present to you

655
01:00:57,125 --> 01:01:01,167
the beautiful home
of Robert Cratchit Esquire.

656
01:01:01,250 --> 01:01:07,250
He owes these sumptuous surroundings
to the generosity of his employer.

657
01:01:07,333 --> 01:01:10,167
I never knew
Cratchit had quite so many children.

658
01:01:10,250 --> 01:01:11,917
No? Did you ever ask him?

659
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:17,375
Mmm. Pure nectar. An elixir
fit for Father Christmas himself.

660
01:01:17,458 --> 01:01:19,375
The stuffing's ready, Father.

661
01:01:19,458 --> 01:01:23,125
- And the birdie is plucked.
- Tremendous work, my dears.

662
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:27,000
Roast goose with sage and onion stuffing
à la Cratchit.

663
01:01:27,083 --> 01:01:28,917
A legendary gourmet dish.

664
01:01:30,458 --> 01:01:34,708
There's one problem. I'm not sure whether
to stuff the goose with the stuffing,

665
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:36,833
or stuff the stuffing with the goose.

666
01:01:43,625 --> 01:01:44,792
Come now, my love.

667
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:47,292
It is a lean Christmas,
there's no denying that.

668
01:01:47,375 --> 01:01:49,625
But we have each other
and we have the children.

669
01:01:49,708 --> 01:01:51,958
We can still make the most of it.

670
01:01:52,042 --> 01:01:56,958
In fact, I do believe this will be
the best Cratchit Christmas ever.

671
01:01:57,042 --> 01:01:58,042
Hooray!

672
01:02:01,708 --> 01:02:03,208
Not another toast.

673
01:02:03,292 --> 01:02:07,042
If you please,
a toast to those whose generosity

674
01:02:07,125 --> 01:02:10,750
have made possible
tomorrow's sumptuous Christmas feast.

675
01:02:10,833 --> 01:02:12,708
Master Timothy and Miss Katherine,

676
01:02:12,792 --> 01:02:15,958
the Christmas-caroling Cratchits,
of course.

677
01:02:16,042 --> 01:02:18,542
And Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

678
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:21,292
Oh! Scrooge?

679
01:02:21,375 --> 01:02:23,833
What are you trying to do,
spoil our Christmas?

680
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:26,708
But his money paid for the goose, my dear.

681
01:02:26,792 --> 01:02:28,875
No, your money paid for the goose.

682
01:02:28,958 --> 01:02:33,208
- If you can even call that a goose.
- But he paid me the money.

683
01:02:33,292 --> 01:02:35,458
Because you earned it.

684
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:38,292
Believe me, you earned that money, Bob.

685
01:02:39,500 --> 01:02:43,083
Mr. Scrooge assures me
that times are hard, my dear.

686
01:02:43,167 --> 01:02:45,917
Times are hard. For us, not him.

687
01:02:46,500 --> 01:02:51,750
Nonetheless, he is the founder
of our feast, and we should drink to him.

688
01:02:51,833 --> 01:02:52,735
Hear! Hear!

689
01:02:52,750 --> 01:02:55,458
The founder of our feast indeed.

690
01:02:55,542 --> 01:02:57,833
I'd like to give him
something to feast on.

691
01:02:57,917 --> 01:03:00,250
He'd have indigestion all January.

692
01:03:05,000 --> 01:03:10,333
Children, we shall drink
to your father.

693
01:03:10,417 --> 01:03:13,500
For the love and happiness he brings us.

694
01:03:13,583 --> 01:03:17,417
And to our Tiny Tim,
for the health we wish him.

695
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:20,375
And, for the sake of your dear father,

696
01:03:20,458 --> 01:03:24,500
I will even drink
to that old miser, Mr. Scrooge.

697
01:03:24,583 --> 01:03:27,458
Long life to him and to us all.

698
01:03:27,542 --> 01:03:29,833
And a merry Christmas to us all.

699
01:03:29,917 --> 01:03:31,625
Merry Christmas!

700
01:03:31,708 --> 01:03:32,917
God bless us.

701
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:35,333
God bless us, every one.

702
01:03:35,417 --> 01:03:37,708
Merry Christmas!

703
01:03:37,792 --> 01:03:40,583
I think Bob Cratchit's rather fond of me.

704
01:03:42,458 --> 01:03:46,958
So is his wife.
Couldn't you tell?

705
01:03:47,042 --> 01:03:51,667
And now, to the triumphant
musical climax of this celebration.

706
01:03:51,750 --> 01:03:55,208
Master Timothy, Miss Katherine,
would you be so kind?

707
01:03:56,125 --> 01:03:57,833
- No.
- Sing, sing!

708
01:03:57,917 --> 01:04:00,125
Go on, love. Sing, sing!

709
01:04:00,208 --> 01:04:01,542
It's embarrassing.

710
01:04:01,625 --> 01:04:02,625
Sing!

711
01:04:02,708 --> 01:04:04,375
I will if Kathy does.

712
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,083
Timmy.

713
01:05:29,083 --> 01:05:32,208
Oh, just breathe. Slowly. That's it.

714
01:05:32,292 --> 01:05:33,833
That's it.

715
01:05:33,917 --> 01:05:34,917
There we go.

716
01:05:36,458 --> 01:05:37,458
Slowly.

717
01:05:54,000 --> 01:05:55,542
Bob's boy, Tim.

718
01:05:57,292 --> 01:05:58,500
What will become of him?

719
01:05:59,083 --> 01:06:02,792
The future is as much a mystery to me
as it is to you.

720
01:06:02,875 --> 01:06:05,000
I can only show you what is.

721
01:06:05,583 --> 01:06:08,667
What's to come if you do not change?

722
01:06:08,750 --> 01:06:13,625
Well, that will soon be revealed
by... someone else.

723
01:06:29,500 --> 01:06:31,542
Oh, excuse me.

724
01:06:32,292 --> 01:06:35,875
Look, friend, there really is
no great secret to any of this.

725
01:06:36,458 --> 01:06:40,208
You just have to do
the best you can with the time you have.

726
01:06:40,792 --> 01:06:42,708
But you better get started soon.

727
01:06:43,583 --> 01:06:47,875
Because before you know it,
all that time you think you have

728
01:06:48,542 --> 01:06:50,542
will run out.

729
01:06:56,292 --> 01:06:58,625
The third, at 3:00.

730
01:07:12,958 --> 01:07:17,208
Well, goodbye, Ebenezer Scroo...

731
01:07:17,292 --> 01:07:18,667
Ooh!

732
01:07:19,708 --> 01:07:21,083
Would you look at that?

733
01:08:41,000 --> 01:08:42,625
I, uh...

734
01:08:45,333 --> 01:08:47,250
We are no longer in the present.

735
01:08:48,000 --> 01:08:49,125
This is the future.

736
01:08:49,875 --> 01:08:51,792
This is what is yet to come.

737
01:08:53,958 --> 01:08:55,750
Are you still in there, giant?

738
01:08:56,250 --> 01:08:59,625
The fellow in the green robes?
Liked life and so forth?

739
01:09:01,125 --> 01:09:02,125
No.

740
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:05,375
You are something else entirely.

741
01:09:06,333 --> 01:09:07,833
You don't speak?

742
01:09:07,917 --> 01:09:10,792
Your colleagues were
rather fond of speaking.

743
01:09:11,375 --> 01:09:12,875
More than I would have liked.

744
01:09:13,958 --> 01:09:19,917
So you are the one that will show me
what awaits if I do not change my ways.

745
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:21,000
Yes?

746
01:09:24,583 --> 01:09:26,333
So I should change, should I?

747
01:09:27,167 --> 01:09:28,667
Why? Tell me.

748
01:09:29,375 --> 01:09:31,292
I live my life as well as I can.

749
01:09:32,292 --> 01:09:35,125
I have my faults, but who does not, truly?

750
01:09:35,958 --> 01:09:39,333
Are all others
I've been shown this night without blame?

751
01:09:39,417 --> 01:09:42,125
Am I the only one
with the power to change my life?

752
01:09:42,208 --> 01:09:44,000
To change the lives of others?

753
01:09:44,792 --> 01:09:46,958
Well? Am I?

754
01:09:48,708 --> 01:09:49,610
Tell me!

755
01:09:52,375 --> 01:09:53,708
Oh, very well.

756
01:09:53,792 --> 01:09:55,042
Lead on.

757
01:09:55,542 --> 01:09:58,583
Show me what bleak future
my wickedness has wrought.

758
01:09:59,083 --> 01:10:02,500
And, yes, nobody can see
or hear me, I know.

759
01:10:09,333 --> 01:10:11,417
Ladies and gentlemen,

760
01:10:11,500 --> 01:10:16,083
good morning to you
on this joyous Christmas Day.

761
01:10:16,583 --> 01:10:21,125
We are gathered here as a group,
united by a common bond.

762
01:10:21,833 --> 01:10:24,792
Namely, our feelings of gratitude

763
01:10:24,875 --> 01:10:29,042
to Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

764
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:30,958
I know that fellow.

765
01:10:31,042 --> 01:10:34,083
Jenkins. Owes me 25... No, 50 pounds.

766
01:10:34,167 --> 01:10:37,917
I must say he looks uncommonly happy
for a man so deep in debt.

767
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:41,292
In fact, most of this rabble
owes me money.

768
01:10:41,375 --> 01:10:43,000
Shush. Shush.

769
01:10:43,083 --> 01:10:45,417
While we are all deeply moved,

770
01:10:45,500 --> 01:10:49,958
those of us who Mr. S was so kind
as to lend money to over the years

771
01:10:50,042 --> 01:10:54,583
are particularly grateful
for what he has done for us today.

772
01:10:54,667 --> 01:10:56,625
What have I done?

773
01:10:56,708 --> 01:10:58,542
Certainly not forgiven their debts.

774
01:10:58,625 --> 01:10:59,833
As your predecessor said,

775
01:10:59,917 --> 01:11:02,875
you are showing me
what will happen if I do not change.

776
01:11:02,958 --> 01:11:06,375
I did not change, yet I am celebrated.

777
01:11:06,458 --> 01:11:07,792
And rightly so.

778
01:11:07,875 --> 01:11:11,958
These creatures have finally
come to their senses. That's it. Ha!

779
01:11:12,917 --> 01:11:16,125
It would seem the ordeal
to which I have been subjected

780
01:11:16,208 --> 01:11:18,208
has been a complete waste of my time.

781
01:11:18,292 --> 01:11:20,792
And yours, my silent friend.

782
01:11:20,875 --> 01:11:23,958
No matter. All's well that ends well,
as they say.

783
01:11:27,417 --> 01:11:31,167
That's right, Prudence.
They're cheering for me.

784
01:11:31,250 --> 01:11:32,193
Yes.

785
01:11:35,125 --> 01:11:37,833
Ladies and gentlemen.

786
01:13:44,208 --> 01:13:45,750
Thank you very much!

787
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,625
Ha, ha! Oh, yes, indeed.

788
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:56,625
This is far more agreeable
than what your predecessors had me endure.

789
01:13:57,125 --> 01:13:58,500
So what's next, friend?

790
01:14:27,417 --> 01:14:28,708
Tiny Tim.

791
01:14:31,083 --> 01:14:32,167
- No.
- It's all right.

792
01:14:32,250 --> 01:14:38,208
Cratchit, times are hard,
and my financial burdens are considerable.

793
01:14:41,417 --> 01:14:44,708
- My boy needs medicine.
- It's Christmas Eve.

794
01:14:45,208 --> 01:14:48,167
Cratchit,
you do nothing but trouble me.

795
01:14:48,250 --> 01:14:52,958
Should I add to them by paying
for the upkeep of your entire family?

796
01:14:53,042 --> 01:14:54,750
I must go now, my little man.

797
01:14:58,417 --> 01:15:01,208
I promised your mother
I'd help with Christmas dinner, but...

798
01:15:01,708 --> 01:15:05,125
I'll come and see you again tomorrow.
Same time, all right?

799
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:09,250
Oh, dear Tim.

800
01:15:10,417 --> 01:15:13,208
Come on now, Father.

801
01:15:14,917 --> 01:15:19,208
Till tomorrow then.
Sleep well, my love. Sweet dreams.

802
01:15:29,542 --> 01:15:30,542
I...

803
01:15:31,042 --> 01:15:32,625
I could have done more.

804
01:15:33,167 --> 01:15:35,375
I could have done something.

805
01:15:36,042 --> 01:15:37,208
Poor Tiny Tim.

806
01:15:38,667 --> 01:15:41,875
Friend, you have shown me
a Christmas yet to come

807
01:15:41,958 --> 01:15:46,667
that mixes great joy with greater sorrow.

808
01:15:49,042 --> 01:15:52,125
Tell me, is this what will be,

809
01:15:52,625 --> 01:15:53,958
or what may be?

810
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:57,083
If I were to change,

811
01:15:57,750 --> 01:15:59,875
would all this still come to pass?

812
01:16:38,458 --> 01:16:39,458
Here.

813
01:16:43,042 --> 01:16:45,417
Gentlemen, please.

814
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,167
Sorry, Father. But you reap what you sow.

815
01:16:48,250 --> 01:16:50,875
Is that not what your Good Book says?

816
01:16:50,958 --> 01:16:54,583
I wouldn't hang about for any mourners.
Nobody's sorry to see this one go.

817
01:16:54,667 --> 01:16:56,917
Nobody who doesn't walk
on all fours anyway.

818
01:16:58,542 --> 01:17:00,292
Merry Christmas.

819
01:17:00,375 --> 01:17:05,083
And thank you very much.

820
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:08,167
Come on.

821
01:17:08,250 --> 01:17:12,625
Earth to earth,
ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

822
01:17:25,833 --> 01:17:27,958
Scrooge...

823
01:17:31,292 --> 01:17:32,277
No.

824
01:17:42,625 --> 01:17:43,625
No.

825
01:18:10,333 --> 01:18:11,333
Spare me.

826
01:18:11,792 --> 01:18:13,042
Let me return.

827
01:18:13,792 --> 01:18:16,792
I will not become this man

828
01:18:16,875 --> 01:18:19,875
whose death is the cause
of such celebration.

829
01:18:21,792 --> 01:18:24,708
Why show me this if I am past all hope?

830
01:18:28,458 --> 01:18:30,208
Am I? Truly?

831
01:18:35,042 --> 01:18:38,667
If... If I am beyond salvation,
then so be it.

832
01:18:39,833 --> 01:18:42,708
But, please, the boy need not die.

833
01:18:43,542 --> 01:18:46,750
Not when I have it in my power
to help him.

834
01:18:47,292 --> 01:18:51,667
I beg of you, spare me for this reason,
if nothing more.

835
01:18:55,875 --> 01:19:00,667
I swear to honor Christmas in my heart
and keep it there the whole year through.

836
01:19:01,250 --> 01:19:04,542
I will learn from the past,
live only in the present,

837
01:19:04,625 --> 01:19:06,583
and strive for a better future.

838
01:19:06,667 --> 01:19:07,875
For all!

839
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:19,917
Tell me I may yet strike the writing
from the boy's cross.

840
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:23,917
Tell me
I may yet break this chain!

841
01:19:25,250 --> 01:19:26,250
Please.

842
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:28,375
Please, tell me!

843
01:19:31,917 --> 01:19:33,833
No!

844
01:19:37,792 --> 01:19:43,125
No!

845
01:20:05,333 --> 01:20:09,083
No! No!
Please, no! No! Please, no!

846
01:20:21,208 --> 01:20:22,583
No! No!

847
01:20:22,667 --> 01:20:24,708
Spare me! Spare me!

848
01:20:24,792 --> 01:20:26,667
Please. Please!

849
01:20:31,125 --> 01:20:32,250
Prudence?

850
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:35,167
Prudence!

851
01:20:36,708 --> 01:20:38,375
I'm in my bedroom.

852
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:41,042
Oh, it's Prudence.

853
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,708
Well, was I... Was I merely dreaming?

854
01:21:21,750 --> 01:21:23,083
- You there!
- Huh?

855
01:21:23,167 --> 01:21:26,292
I-I say, what day is it, my fine fellow?

856
01:21:26,375 --> 01:21:28,833
Um, Tuesday, I think.

857
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:30,042
Ha, no.

858
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:31,667
Is it Christmas Day?

859
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,667
Well, of course it is.

860
01:21:36,750 --> 01:21:38,958
Takes all kinds, I suppose.

861
01:21:39,042 --> 01:21:41,208
It's Christmas, Prudence!

862
01:21:41,292 --> 01:21:44,708
It's Christmas, and I'm alive!

863
01:21:45,375 --> 01:21:47,375
Wait, what time is it?

864
01:21:49,583 --> 01:21:52,167
I'm glad Isabel found
the happiness she deserved.

865
01:21:53,167 --> 01:21:54,167
Perhaps...

866
01:21:54,792 --> 01:21:57,667
Perhaps it's not too late
for me to find my own.

867
01:22:13,333 --> 01:22:16,250
I did. I swear. I said...

868
01:22:16,333 --> 01:22:17,917
- Hello there.
- What?

869
01:22:19,792 --> 01:22:22,958
What is it?
We didn't do nothing, Mr. Scrooge.

870
01:22:23,042 --> 01:22:25,458
No, not yet, you haven't.

871
01:22:25,542 --> 01:22:29,333
I have some errands for you to run.
I can make it worth your while.

872
01:22:31,958 --> 01:22:32,958
Errands?

873
01:22:42,333 --> 01:22:44,333
Thank you, Prudence. There's a good girl.

874
01:22:44,417 --> 01:22:46,917
Ah, ah, ah, ahh!

875
01:22:48,792 --> 01:22:50,125
Mind how you go.

876
01:22:57,375 --> 01:22:58,792
Mr. Scrooge, sir.

877
01:22:59,625 --> 01:23:00,708
Almost done.

878
01:23:00,792 --> 01:23:05,292
Magnificent.
What wonderful children you all are.

879
01:23:05,375 --> 01:23:07,375
And, well, sorry to ask again,

880
01:23:07,917 --> 01:23:10,625
but you're sure
you managed to get everything on the list?

881
01:23:10,708 --> 01:23:11,610
Yes, sir.

882
01:23:11,625 --> 01:23:14,917
The butchers and the bakers
thought I was having a laugh.

883
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:18,750
But then I gave 'em the checks.
They'll be here soon.

884
01:23:18,833 --> 01:23:22,500
Splendid. And you did deliver
the invitations? All of them?

885
01:23:22,583 --> 01:23:23,583
Of course.

886
01:23:24,417 --> 01:23:28,208
No guarantee they'll come, though.
It is very short notice.

887
01:23:28,292 --> 01:23:32,417
Quite. Uh, you are
a clever young lady, aren't you?

888
01:23:33,375 --> 01:23:36,875
As promised,
a gold sovereign for each of you.

889
01:23:38,083 --> 01:23:41,833
Boys, since it's Christmas,
I ain't even gonna take my cut.

890
01:23:41,917 --> 01:23:45,292
That's the spirit.
And you'll all stay for dinner, won't you?

891
01:23:45,792 --> 01:23:46,792
Won't you?

892
01:23:47,208 --> 01:23:48,708
Yay!

893
01:23:48,792 --> 01:23:50,750
Ha! And help yourself to a gift.

894
01:23:50,833 --> 01:23:52,708
Yay!

895
01:23:52,792 --> 01:23:55,167
- Come on.
- I get the biggest one.

896
01:23:56,167 --> 01:23:57,333
Ready, Prudence?

897
01:25:00,333 --> 01:25:04,958
- There we go. Comfortable enough, Ethel?
- Yes. Much obliged, Mr. Scrooge.

898
01:25:05,042 --> 01:25:08,458
Good, good, good.
Oh, and please, call me Ebenezer.

899
01:25:09,208 --> 01:25:13,250
- What's all this about then?
- Tom, your debt is canceled.

900
01:25:15,458 --> 01:25:17,375
Merry Christmas, my friend.

901
01:25:17,458 --> 01:25:20,083
Oh, and give my best
to your mother, won't you?

902
01:25:20,167 --> 01:25:22,292
Thank you. Thank you very much.

903
01:25:23,375 --> 01:25:25,333
Oh, my giddy aunt!

904
01:25:25,417 --> 01:25:29,833
Ladies, 1,000 pounds for your fund,
this and every Christmas to come.

905
01:25:29,917 --> 01:25:32,792
Oh, such generosity.

906
01:25:34,125 --> 01:25:38,958
It's the doll from my mother's picture.
Uncle, I can't accept this.

907
01:25:39,042 --> 01:25:40,167
You must.

908
01:25:40,250 --> 01:25:44,333
It's a gift from an old fool who regrets
all the Christmases we never shared.

909
01:25:44,417 --> 01:25:45,583
Oh, Uncle.

910
01:25:45,667 --> 01:25:47,125
Thank you.

911
01:25:52,375 --> 01:25:55,875
- "Business partners"?
- Yes, Bob. If you'll have me, that is.

912
01:25:56,542 --> 01:25:59,292
Let's build a brighter future
for the Cratchits together.

913
01:25:59,875 --> 01:26:02,583
- What do you say?
- I say yes!

914
01:26:03,250 --> 01:26:05,000
God bless you, Mr. Scrooge.

915
01:27:00,292 --> 01:27:02,750
God bless us, every one.

916
01:27:11,125 --> 01:27:14,083
Uh! Here we go! Ha!

917
01:27:14,792 --> 01:27:15,693
Come on!

918
01:27:35,500 --> 01:27:36,500
Let's go!

919
01:27:39,083 --> 01:27:40,375
Come on, get up, ha!

920
01:28:06,583 --> 01:28:08,583
One more time, one more time!

921
01:28:10,708 --> 01:28:12,500
Hey, listen to me now.

922
01:28:28,875 --> 01:28:29,875
Stop.

923
01:28:52,958 --> 01:28:53,958
Ow!

924
01:28:54,375 --> 01:28:57,958
- Whoo!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

925
01:29:23,125 --> 01:29:24,027
Hoo!

926
01:29:46,333 --> 01:29:48,000
Merry Christmas!
