1
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,407
Brooklyn, New York...
in the 1880's.

2
00:02:04,365 --> 00:02:07,532
I never saw a man meet death
with finer courage.

3
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:13,365
Don't let her stay in there too long.

4
00:02:35,865 --> 00:02:38,532
Dearest, is Father...

5
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,032
is Father well now?

6
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:46,240
Yes, dear, he's well, he's quite well,

7
00:02:46,323 --> 00:02:48,448
but we have no one left
now but each other.

8
00:02:50,323 --> 00:02:51,740
No one at all.

9
00:02:55,407 --> 00:02:57,073
My baby!

10
00:03:04,532 --> 00:03:10,240
Ceddie was not old enough to
know of anything else to do,

11
00:03:10,282 --> 00:03:12,573
so he did what he could

12
00:03:12,782 --> 00:03:17,907
and was more of a comfort to
her than he understood.

13
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:21,865
Strawberries! Fresh strawberries!

14
00:03:23,323 --> 00:03:25,698
Strawberries!

15
00:03:25,823 --> 00:03:27,865
Fresh strawberries!

16
00:03:34,282 --> 00:03:35,907
He'll be pleased, won't he?

17
00:03:35,948 --> 00:03:39,490
Ach, the darlin'! To think of him
getting the like of that for his birthday.

18
00:03:39,532 --> 00:03:43,157
Sure he'll be the happiest boy in all
Brooklyn till he falls off of it!

19
00:03:44,365 --> 00:03:45,365
Dearest!

20
00:03:49,032 --> 00:03:50,782
Dearest!
- All right, Ceddie.

21
00:03:52,573 --> 00:03:54,657
Oh, Dearest... Look! Look!

22
00:03:54,823 --> 00:03:58,782
Mary's brother, Michael, has made
it for me and Mary's given me this book.

23
00:03:59,115 --> 00:04:01,657
It's "The Adventures of Robin Hood
and His Merry Men".

24
00:04:02,698 --> 00:04:03,698
Listen,

25
00:04:03,865 --> 00:04:09,115
Back varlets! Touch Maid Marian at your
peril. However many you be, I defy you all!

26
00:04:09,990 --> 00:04:13,573
See, Dearest, you're Maid Marian,
and I'm Robin Hood.

27
00:04:14,032 --> 00:04:17,740
They crowd around you. I'll never leave
your side however many there are!

28
00:04:17,782 --> 00:04:20,948
Oh! - Now, Dearest, you cry out:
"Help me, Robin Hood!"

29
00:04:21,032 --> 00:04:22,657
Help me, Robin Hood! Help! Help!

30
00:04:22,698 --> 00:04:24,615
Down with you, varlets! Now I'm...
- Oh!

31
00:04:25,907 --> 00:04:26,865
There!

32
00:04:33,073 --> 00:04:34,073
Do you like it?

33
00:04:35,323 --> 00:04:36,323
Oh my!

34
00:04:38,323 --> 00:04:43,365
Of all events in my life
this is the most magnificent!

35
00:04:44,282 --> 00:04:49,782
Do you really like it, darling? It's what
you wanted? - It's exactly what I wanted!

36
00:04:49,865 --> 00:04:54,740
I do hope it is! Only you will be careful,
won't you and not let it run away with you?

37
00:04:54,948 --> 00:04:58,323
I suppose I'm about the safest bicycle
rider in the whole Brooklyn!

38
00:04:58,448 --> 00:05:01,032
Ha-ha - d'ya mind that now!

39
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:04,198
Can I ride it now, Dearest?
Can I go now? - Go!

40
00:05:05,448 --> 00:05:08,907
I can't wait one minute.
Mr. Hobbs has to see it and Dick.

41
00:05:09,365 --> 00:05:13,490
Can I go now, Dearest, at once?
- Yes, dear, only do be careful.

42
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,532
All right, there we are!

43
00:05:17,198 --> 00:05:18,740
Bring it down slow.

44
00:05:19,365 --> 00:05:20,407
Ceddie! Ceddie!

45
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:23,240
Do be careful of the streetcars
if you get out the sidewalk.

46
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:26,782
Oh, I will! - Now, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

47
00:05:26,865 --> 00:05:28,032
Good-bye, Dearest!

48
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,198
Good-bye!

49
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,715
Ah-ha! Be careful.

50
00:05:30,948 --> 00:05:34,115
I'll be careful, I'll be careful,
I'll be careful.

51
00:05:34,948 --> 00:05:36,740
I'll be careful.

52
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,490
Good morning, Mrs. McGillycuddy.
- Good morning, Ceddie, a very good morning.

53
00:05:43,573 --> 00:05:45,448
How are your bones
today, Mrs. McGillycuddy?

54
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:48,282
Oh, none too good after
the rainstorm yesterday.

55
00:05:48,532 --> 00:05:51,573
Oh, they ached last night somethin' cruel.

56
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,240
Ties me up in knots the rain does.
- Does it? How very peculiar.

57
00:05:56,823 --> 00:06:00,282
But, ah, it's a fine day to go bicycle riding.

58
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:04,490
Oh, I suppose so, for them that
has bicycles and can ride them.

59
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:09,365
I suppose everybody who has a new bicycle
will take it out and ride it today.

60
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:14,032
Glory be the goodness! And whose
bicycle might that be? - It's mine!

61
00:06:14,198 --> 00:06:18,323
It's my birthday present from Dearest.
- Oh, it's a daisy, shure.

62
00:06:18,407 --> 00:06:22,365
Fine enough for the president to ride.
- And it has all the latest improvements.

63
00:06:23,865 --> 00:06:27,198
Oh! Sorta sounds like
the bells of St. Patrick!

64
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:30,615
Shure it's the luckiest
boy in the world ya are.

65
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,365
Well I'll have to be going.

66
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:37,740
I nearly forgot. Please choose my
apple now, Mrs. McGillicuddy.

67
00:06:37,948 --> 00:06:40,990
But would you mind keeping it for me
until I get back? -Sure.

68
00:07:14,032 --> 00:07:17,990
Oh, there he goes oh, there he goes
All dressed up in his purty clothes

69
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:22,240
The way ain' near away'n it be
That's as tough as it's going to be

70
00:07:22,865 --> 00:07:26,448
Hey, where'd ya get de ice wagon?
- I'd like to get by, please.

71
00:07:26,532 --> 00:07:29,615
Give us a little ride, will ya, bub?
- I'm sorry, no.

72
00:07:29,698 --> 00:07:33,490
Aw, scared I'd get it dirty?
- No, but I'd rather ride it myself.

73
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,907
Hey, English, when did ya get back from
dear old London? - I'm not English.

74
00:07:39,990 --> 00:07:42,865
I'm American.
- Then where'd ya get that kinda gab?

75
00:07:43,282 --> 00:07:47,323
My Father was English.
- Oh, does yer mudder know you're out?

76
00:07:47,407 --> 00:07:50,073
Don't you dare talk about my mother!
- Mama's pet!

77
00:07:50,157 --> 00:07:53,490
Mama's pet! Mama's pet! Ha, ha, ha.

78
00:07:54,115 --> 00:07:57,907
I think you'd better take your hand off
that wheel. - Want to make anything out of it?

79
00:07:57,990 --> 00:07:59,615
I want to make you get out of the way.

80
00:07:59,698 --> 00:08:02,573
Ooh, ha... ha.

81
00:08:02,657 --> 00:08:06,823
You don't dast, you sissy cat.?- Sissy cat! Sissy cat!

82
00:08:07,448 --> 00:08:08,448
Ha, ha... ha.

83
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:13,698
Wait a minute, Ceddie!
Don't let them bluff you! I'll be right there.

84
00:08:13,782 --> 00:08:14,740
Ha, ha... ha.

85
00:08:17,823 --> 00:08:19,490
Ha, ha, ha! Ha, ha, ha!

86
00:08:41,865 --> 00:08:43,573
Let go!

87
00:08:47,823 --> 00:08:49,990
Go on, Dick! Strike him on the snoot!

88
00:08:51,615 --> 00:08:52,615
Booo!

89
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:55,865
Hit him with the right!
Poke him in the kisser!

90
00:08:59,948 --> 00:09:01,615
Heh, cheese it - a cop!

91
00:09:03,573 --> 00:09:06,657
Here, ye young devils!
Git outta here! Git out! Git out!

92
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:16,907
Aw, why couldn't that copper
leave us alone? - We had 'em licked!

93
00:09:17,365 --> 00:09:19,782
Thanks terribly for coming
to my rescue, Dick.

94
00:09:19,823 --> 00:09:22,407
That makes us even for me
givin' ya de mumps, hunh?

95
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:24,365
They didn't even scratch it.

96
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,115
Gee whillikers! Where'd you swipe that?

97
00:09:27,282 --> 00:09:30,907
Dearest gave it to me. Isn't it
magnificent? - It's a lalapalooza!

98
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,115
I want you to be the very first
person to ride on it. - Aw, t'anks.

99
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:35,615
Ahem!

100
00:09:41,698 --> 00:09:42,698
Aw!

101
00:09:47,615 --> 00:09:51,823
Thank you very much for your assistance, Mr.
O'Brien. - It's a pleasure, Ceddie, me lad.

102
00:09:52,198 --> 00:09:54,282
Course, I think we might have won anyway.

103
00:09:55,032 --> 00:09:59,157
Sure, and don't I know it! But I had
to keep ya from committin' murder.

104
00:09:59,823 --> 00:10:03,490
I tell you what, Dick. I'll just go once
around the block and then you can ride it

105
00:10:03,573 --> 00:10:04,573
to Mr. Hobbs store.

106
00:10:04,657 --> 00:10:08,490
Make it later, 'cause I gotta see
me brudder Ben off. He's goin' out West.

107
00:10:08,532 --> 00:10:11,365
Oh, is he? Where? Texas?
- No, Chicago.

108
00:10:11,573 --> 00:10:14,865
Oh, that would be splendid!
Riding mustangs and shooting bears!

109
00:10:19,323 --> 00:10:20,740
Dere's me brudder Ben now.

110
00:10:20,823 --> 00:10:23,115
Come on, Dick. I've got to leave.

111
00:10:25,657 --> 00:10:28,365
Well, come on down to Mr. Hobbs' store
as quickly as you can.

112
00:10:33,115 --> 00:10:35,448
HOBBS' FANCY VEGETABLES & GROCERIES

113
00:10:36,657 --> 00:10:41,240
What do you say to a little birthday party?
Ginger pop and cookies, and some candy?

114
00:10:41,323 --> 00:10:45,407
That would be perfect Mr. Hobbs! Only...
- Only?

115
00:10:46,282 --> 00:10:51,698
Well, oh, Dick's coming very soon and
I was thinking, oh, if we could wait.

116
00:10:51,865 --> 00:10:53,782
I guess there'll be enough to go around.

117
00:10:55,865 --> 00:10:58,948
There's a lump coming,
I think, quite a big one!

118
00:10:59,698 --> 00:11:01,740
What are you reading, Mr. Hobbs?

119
00:11:01,823 --> 00:11:06,907
Ah! That's the way they go on now.
British aristocracy!

120
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:12,032
I've got no use for 'em - earls and
marquises goin' around as if they was

121
00:11:12,073 --> 00:11:14,865
lords of creation, wearin' their coronets.

122
00:11:14,948 --> 00:11:19,532
Did you ever know any marquises, Mr. Hobbs,
or earls? - No, I should say not.

123
00:11:20,073 --> 00:11:22,698
I'd just like to catch one of 'em
inside here, that's all!

124
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:26,740
I'll have no graspin' tyrant sittin'
around on my cracker barrels!

125
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,948
Perhaps they wouldn't be earls
if they knew any better.

126
00:11:29,032 --> 00:11:33,365
Oh, wouldn't they though!
They just glory in it! It's in 'em.

127
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:36,157
They're a bad lot.

128
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:41,032
Here you are, Dick. Just in time
for Ceddie's birthday feast.

129
00:11:41,115 --> 00:11:43,073
Jimminity... ginger pop and everything!

130
00:11:43,115 --> 00:11:45,782
Here's to your health, Ceddie.
Many happy birthdays!

131
00:11:46,323 --> 00:11:47,907
Thank you very much, Mr. Hobbs.

132
00:11:49,323 --> 00:11:50,323
Why, Mary?

133
00:11:52,073 --> 00:11:54,490
Come on home, darlin'.
The mistress is wanting ya.

134
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:57,365
Oh, glory be! Would you look at your face!

135
00:11:57,532 --> 00:12:00,865
I'm very sorry, Mr. Hobbs, but I shan't be
able to stay for the feast.

136
00:12:01,573 --> 00:12:05,407
Is anything wrong with the Dearest?
- Not at all. Sure, there's nothin' the matter.

137
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:08,198
What's happened, Mary?
- Now, don't be askin' me any questions.

138
00:12:08,698 --> 00:12:12,448
But there's the queer, strange things
happenin' to us.

139
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:17,115
If you'll forgive me, Mrs. Errol, you must
not disregard the great position

140
00:12:17,198 --> 00:12:21,657
to which your son has fallen heir through
the death of his uncle, your late husband's brother.

141
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:26,323
But what it amounts to, Mr. Havisham, is
that you want to take my boy away.

142
00:12:26,407 --> 00:12:29,365
Mrs. Errol, you must remember
that I'm acting quite impersonally

143
00:12:29,448 --> 00:12:32,448
and simply as the lawyer of the earl of Dorincourt.

144
00:12:32,532 --> 00:12:34,823
The earl of Dorincourt disowned his son

145
00:12:34,907 --> 00:12:37,407
and has refused to recognize
his grandson until now.

146
00:12:38,948 --> 00:12:40,573
Why should I give up my boy?

147
00:12:41,448 --> 00:12:44,657
I'm afraid I've been very stupid,
Mrs. Errol. I should have told you.

148
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:48,407
My instructions are that you shall accompany
Lord Fauntleroy to England. - Oh!

149
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:54,115
However, I must remind you that Lord
Dorincourt is not very friendly towards you.

150
00:12:54,657 --> 00:12:58,157
He's an old man and has always
had very strong prejudices

151
00:12:58,198 --> 00:13:02,615
against America and Americans and was
bitterly opposed to his son's marriage.

152
00:13:03,490 --> 00:13:06,157
He's fixed in his determination
not to see you.

153
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:11,532
You will live at the lodge and a suitable
income will be provided for you.

154
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:15,865
The only stipulation is that you make no attempt

155
00:13:15,907 --> 00:13:20,282
to visit your son in the castle,
nor even enter the Park Gates.

156
00:13:24,282 --> 00:13:25,865
There's your sister, Mary.

157
00:13:26,407 --> 00:13:29,198
Hello, Bridget. Why, what's the matter?

158
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:34,240
It's Michael! He's worse and we've no
money we can't pay the rent.

159
00:13:34,865 --> 00:13:39,448
I don't know what... - Now, Bridget, I've
more important things to attend to!

160
00:13:44,157 --> 00:13:48,198
I wonder what your husband's wishes
would have been in this matter?

161
00:13:50,282 --> 00:13:52,532
You knew my husband?

162
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:56,698
Yes, I knew Captain Errol well
and liked him, as everybody did.

163
00:13:58,740 --> 00:14:02,157
He was greatly attached to his old home.
- Yes, I know.

164
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:08,407
He, above everyone, would have appreciated
what this means to your son

165
00:14:08,948 --> 00:14:11,407
the very great advantages he'll have.

166
00:14:13,115 --> 00:14:15,615
Yes, you're right.

167
00:14:16,907 --> 00:14:18,448
My husband would have wished it.

168
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:25,157
Mr. Havisham, I must ask you to let me
tell Ceddie about this in my own way

169
00:14:25,198 --> 00:14:29,573
and in my very own time. He must never
know his grandfather dislikes me.

170
00:14:29,782 --> 00:14:32,907
If he did, it would make it harder
for them to be friends.

171
00:14:33,157 --> 00:14:37,115
Very well. Your son will thank you
for this when he is a man.

172
00:14:37,907 --> 00:14:40,782
I hope his grandfather will love Ceddie.

173
00:14:40,823 --> 00:14:44,198
He has a very affectionate nature
and he's always been loved.

174
00:14:54,323 --> 00:14:57,740
This is Mr. Havisham, dear, whom your
grandfather sent to see us,

175
00:14:57,823 --> 00:14:58,990
all the way from England.

176
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:04,532
How do you do, sir?
- So this is little Lord Fauntleroy.

177
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:21,032
You see, dear, your grandfather has no
more children now, and he's very lonely.

178
00:15:21,532 --> 00:15:23,948
So he wants us to go
and live with him in England.

179
00:15:24,615 --> 00:15:30,282
Because he's an earl and you're his heir,
you will have a new name - Lord Fauntleroy.

180
00:15:30,865 --> 00:15:33,115
And someday you will be
the earl of Dorincourt.

181
00:15:34,323 --> 00:15:38,282
Oh, Dearest, do I have to be an earl?
None of the boys are earls.

182
00:15:38,323 --> 00:15:41,532
Can't I not be one? - I'm afraid it can't
be helped, dear.

183
00:15:42,157 --> 00:15:45,323
Just think, dear,
soon we'll be starting for England.

184
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,282
Do we have to go to England, Dearest?
I'd much rather not.

185
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:54,698
Oh! What will Mr. Hobbs say?

186
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:03,032
Anything else ma'am?
- How much is your table butter?

187
00:16:03,115 --> 00:16:08,073
13 cents a pound.
- 13! The last I bought was 12,5 cents.

188
00:16:08,157 --> 00:16:12,615
Must've been last month. It's 13 today.
- Oh, indeed. Well, never mind the butter.

189
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:16,740
Heavens and earth, if the prices go any
higher, we'll all starve to death!

190
00:16:18,198 --> 00:16:19,823
Good day!
- Good day, ma'am.

191
00:16:20,782 --> 00:16:22,740
Hello, Ceddie. What's the matter?

192
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,657
Mr. Hobbs, do you remember what we were
talking about yesterday morning?

193
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,532
It seems to me we was
talkin' about England.

194
00:16:34,282 --> 00:16:37,282
Yes, yes and earls. Don't you remember?

195
00:16:37,657 --> 00:16:40,990
Oh, yes, we did touch 'em up a little.
That's so.

196
00:16:41,782 --> 00:16:44,907
You said you wouldn't have them sitting
around your cracker barrels.

197
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:49,907
So I did and I meant it too!
Just let them try it, that's all!

198
00:16:51,698 --> 00:16:55,698
Mr. Hobbs, one is sitting on this barrel now.

199
00:17:01,323 --> 00:17:04,448
What?
- Yes.

200
00:17:04,740 --> 00:17:09,240
I'm one or I'm going to be.
I won't deceive you, Mr. Hobbs.

201
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,198
It's the heat!

202
00:17:18,323 --> 00:17:19,323
It is a hot day.

203
00:17:23,032 --> 00:17:25,532
How do ya feel? Got any pain?

204
00:17:25,990 --> 00:17:27,282
Thank you, I'm all right.

205
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:30,615
I'm sorry to say it's true, Mr. Hobbs.

206
00:17:31,198 --> 00:17:35,490
Mr. Havisham, he's a lawyer, came all the way
from England to tell us about it.

207
00:17:35,532 --> 00:17:37,115
My grandfather sent him.

208
00:17:38,448 --> 00:17:39,615
Who is your grandfather?

209
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:43,198
I couldn't very easily remember it,
so I wrote it down.

210
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:48,865
John Arthur Molyneux Errol,
earl of Dorincourt.

211
00:17:49,823 --> 00:17:53,948
That's his name, and he lives in a castle
'er two or three castles, I think.

212
00:17:54,740 --> 00:18:00,490
All his sons have died now. That's why I
shall be an earl. Now I'm Lord Fauntleroy.

213
00:18:02,282 --> 00:18:06,365
Well, I'll be jiggered.
One of us has got a sunstroke.

214
00:18:07,157 --> 00:18:12,615
Oh, no, we haven't. We'll have
to make the best of it, Mr. Hobbs.

215
00:18:14,532 --> 00:18:19,532
What did you say your name was?
- Cedric Errol Lord Fauntleroy.

216
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:22,657
Well, I am jiggered.

217
00:18:23,365 --> 00:18:27,240
Well... you always did talk
more English than American.

218
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:31,532
You think there's no getting out of it?

219
00:18:32,782 --> 00:18:34,365
I'm afraid not, Mr. Hobbs.

220
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,490
Dearest says that Father
would wish me to do it

221
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:42,823
but if I have to be an earl,
I can try to be a good one.

222
00:18:43,532 --> 00:18:46,157
I'm not going to be a tyrant, Mr. Hobbs

223
00:18:46,282 --> 00:18:49,823
and if there's ever to be another war
with America, I shall try and stop it.

224
00:18:56,823 --> 00:18:59,073
England's a long way off, isn't it?

225
00:19:00,532 --> 00:19:02,032
It's across the Atlantic Ocean.

226
00:19:05,157 --> 00:19:09,198
That's the worst of it. Perhaps
I shan't see you for a long time.

227
00:19:10,407 --> 00:19:12,948
I don't like to think about that, Mr. Hobbs.

228
00:19:14,407 --> 00:19:17,573
Well... the best of friends must part.

229
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:35,157
I'm afraid, Mr. Havisham, our American
food must seem very strange for you.

230
00:19:35,240 --> 00:19:39,615
A little, ma'am. I find that muffins are
biscuits, and biscuits are cookies

231
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:41,740
but the cooking's excellent.

232
00:19:41,823 --> 00:19:46,115
And after all, it's the company that
makes the meal exquisite, not the food.

233
00:19:46,198 --> 00:19:47,490
Thank you, Mr. Havisham.

234
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:53,907
When you're an earl, you'll give splendid
dinners in one of the most beautiful castles

235
00:19:53,948 --> 00:19:54,657
in England.

236
00:19:55,073 --> 00:19:58,115
Do you know, I'm not sure I know
exactly what an earl is?

237
00:19:58,823 --> 00:20:01,948
If anybody's going to be one,
he ought to know, don't you?

238
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:03,990
Would you mind explaining it to me?

239
00:20:04,698 --> 00:20:09,157
Well, someone is made an earl generally
because he's done some service

240
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,198
to his sovereign or some great deed.
- Oh, that's like the president!

241
00:20:13,407 --> 00:20:15,907
Oh, is it? Is that why
your presidents are elected?

242
00:20:16,032 --> 00:20:20,657
Yes, sir, When a man's very good and
knows a great deal, he's elected president.

243
00:20:21,115 --> 00:20:25,740
And they have torchlight processions, and
bands, and everybody makes speeches.

244
00:20:26,323 --> 00:20:30,740
I used to think I might like to be president
but never thought of being an earl.

245
00:20:30,823 --> 00:20:33,323
No, being an earl is rather different
from being a president.

246
00:20:33,365 --> 00:20:37,073
An earl is generally
of very ancient lineage.

247
00:20:37,532 --> 00:20:38,782
Uh, what's that?

248
00:20:39,823 --> 00:20:42,407
A very old family - extremely old.

249
00:20:42,907 --> 00:20:46,948
Oh, that's like the apple woman.
She's a hundred, I should think.

250
00:20:47,282 --> 00:20:50,865
She's of such ancient lineage, it'd
surprise you how she can stand up.

251
00:20:55,073 --> 00:20:58,740
You feel sorry for anyone who's so poor
and has such ancient lineage.

252
00:20:58,823 --> 00:21:03,282
She says hers has gone into her bones
and rain makes it worse. - Ha, ha, ha.

253
00:21:03,907 --> 00:21:06,823
When I said ancient lineage,
I didn't mean old age.

254
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:11,407
The first earl of Dorincourt was created
an earl hundreds of years ago.

255
00:21:12,073 --> 00:21:15,615
Well, that was a long time ago,
wasn't it Dearest? - Yes, dear.

256
00:21:15,782 --> 00:21:19,782
Many earls have been very brave men
and have fought in great battles.

257
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:22,032
I should like to do it myself.

258
00:21:22,323 --> 00:21:26,532
My father was a soldier and a very brave
man as brave as George Washington.

259
00:21:26,823 --> 00:21:29,490
I'm glad earls are brave.
That's a great 'vantage.

260
00:21:30,490 --> 00:21:34,823
Would you excuse me a moment, please?
There's someone I must see. - Oh, certainly.

261
00:21:38,698 --> 00:21:42,615
There's, um, there's another
advantage of being an earl.

262
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,740
Some of them have a great deal of money.

263
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:52,157
That's a good thing to have. I wish I had
a great deal of money. - Do you? Why?

264
00:21:52,448 --> 00:21:55,490
There's so many things
a person can do with money.

265
00:21:55,573 --> 00:21:59,490
If I were rich, I'd buy the apple
woman a tent to put her stall in

266
00:21:59,573 --> 00:22:04,032
and a stove. I'd give her a shawl, because
then her bones wouldn't feel so badly.

267
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:08,573
What else would you do
if you were rich?

268
00:22:08,698 --> 00:22:12,115
I'd buy Dearest all sorts
of beautiful things. - Dearest?

269
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:14,948
I call Mother, "Dearest"
because Father did.

270
00:22:15,032 --> 00:22:18,323
Then there's Dick.
- And who's Dick? - Dick's a bootblack.

271
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:23,865
I'd buy him some new cloths, some brushes
and a new sign - and start him out fair.

272
00:22:24,073 --> 00:22:28,573
He says that's all he wants is to start
out fair. - Hmm. Is there anything else?

273
00:22:29,948 --> 00:22:32,990
Well, I think Mr. Hobbs would
like a gold watch and chain.

274
00:22:33,073 --> 00:22:37,032
But what would you get just
for yourself, if you were rich?

275
00:22:37,698 --> 00:22:42,323
Isn't there one particular thing
you've dreaming of having? - Yes.

276
00:22:44,990 --> 00:22:50,407
A pony... but I suppose that would
be too much to even dream about.

277
00:22:52,532 --> 00:22:53,782
I'm so sorry.

278
00:22:55,198 --> 00:22:57,365
A poor woman in trouble came to see me.

279
00:22:58,073 --> 00:23:00,115
Oh, is it Bridget?
- Yes, dear.

280
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:02,615
I wish we could do something for her.

281
00:23:03,365 --> 00:23:06,282
She has six children and her husband
is out of work.

282
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:10,240
He has inflammatory rheumatism and that's
the kind of rheumatism that's dreadful.

283
00:23:10,490 --> 00:23:15,240
Before I left Dorincourt castle, the earl
said that if you expressed any wishes,

284
00:23:15,948 --> 00:23:20,865
I was to gratify them and give you
anything you desired.

285
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:25,323
Now, here... here are five pounds -

286
00:23:25,907 --> 00:23:27,698
in your money, 25 dollars.

287
00:23:28,948 --> 00:23:32,157
If you have any desire to assist this
poor woman,

288
00:23:32,490 --> 00:23:35,657
I am sure your grandfather would wish it.
- Can I have it now?

289
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,032
Can I give it to her this minute?

290
00:23:40,448 --> 00:23:43,573
May I be excused, please, Dearest?
- Yes, Ceddie. - Bridget!

291
00:23:45,032 --> 00:23:47,407
Bridget, wait a minute!
Here's some money!

292
00:23:47,448 --> 00:23:49,823
My grandfather gave it to me!
It's for you!

293
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:54,782
That's a great deal of money, Mr.
Havisham. We've never had very much.

294
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:59,157
I'm just beginning to realize
the great power Ceddie will have.

295
00:24:00,198 --> 00:24:02,907
Such a child still...
I'm a little afraid.

296
00:24:03,407 --> 00:24:06,823
I think whom what I've seen of him
that you have nothing to fear.

297
00:24:06,907 --> 00:24:11,073
Oh, I hope not. He mustn't be spoilt
by all these wonderful changes.

298
00:24:15,782 --> 00:24:20,073
She cried!
She said she was crying for joy.

299
00:24:22,532 --> 00:24:25,115
I newer saw anyone cry for joy before.

300
00:24:28,282 --> 00:24:30,573
My grandfather must be a very good man.

301
00:24:34,157 --> 00:24:38,157
It's more... more agreeable being an earl
than I thought it was going to be.

302
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:42,782
In fact I'm almost quite glad
I'm going to be one!

303
00:24:43,782 --> 00:24:44,782
Heh.

304
00:24:45,782 --> 00:24:49,948
MRS. CEDRIC ERROL COURT LODGE

305
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:12,740
We always liked that little house, didn't
we, Dearest? - We always will like it.

306
00:25:15,115 --> 00:25:16,573
Yes, darling, yes.

307
00:25:32,865 --> 00:25:36,032
I've come to say good-bye.
I have to go to England to be a lord.

308
00:25:36,115 --> 00:25:39,865
I shouldn't like your bones in my mind
every time it rains. - Oh, ho!

309
00:25:40,407 --> 00:25:44,990
Bless your dear little heart with all kindness
to me, me bones is as quiet as anything.

310
00:25:48,115 --> 00:25:50,615
Can I give you a kiss for luck?
- Of course.

311
00:25:57,032 --> 00:26:00,907
Here's an apple to eat on the boat.
- Thank you very much.

312
00:26:01,782 --> 00:26:04,532
Oh, no, darlin'... Why should you pay?

313
00:26:04,615 --> 00:26:08,407
As me late husband used to say,
"This one's on the house."

314
00:26:08,740 --> 00:26:13,615
Thank you again. Well, good-bye.
- Good-bye, darlin'.

315
00:26:42,657 --> 00:26:43,657
Well...

316
00:26:46,615 --> 00:26:47,615
Well...

317
00:26:49,407 --> 00:26:50,407
Well...

318
00:26:53,198 --> 00:26:54,198
Well...

319
00:26:55,990 --> 00:26:57,198
Well, good-bye.

320
00:26:59,157 --> 00:27:01,198
I hope trade will be good.

321
00:27:01,865 --> 00:27:05,698
Chee, if trade gets any better, I'll be
rollin' around in di'monds and poils!

322
00:27:06,282 --> 00:27:08,032
That would be splendid, wouldn't it!

323
00:27:09,240 --> 00:27:12,157
I hope you have every sort
of luck and happiness.

324
00:27:12,865 --> 00:27:16,323
Thanks - same to you!
An' I hope you t'ink about us sometime

325
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:20,448
when you're way over dere,
as dey say, "on foreign surl".

326
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,823
I'll think about you all the time. I'll
write to you. And you must write to me.

327
00:27:27,865 --> 00:27:29,448
Here's where you send your letter.

328
00:27:31,407 --> 00:27:32,407
Chee, I...

329
00:27:32,907 --> 00:27:34,573
I wish you wasn't goin' away.

330
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:39,990
T'anks, mister, for the t'ings
you're done for him.

331
00:27:40,073 --> 00:27:42,240
He certainly deserves 'em.
He's a game little kid.

332
00:27:45,282 --> 00:27:46,782
Chee, I almost forgot!

333
00:27:49,365 --> 00:27:51,032
Here, I bought dis for ya.

334
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:55,115
It's a hankercheef. You can use it
when you get among dem swells.

335
00:27:56,823 --> 00:27:58,823
Oh, Dick! It's beautiful!

336
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:02,198
It's extraordinary!

337
00:28:02,907 --> 00:28:04,282
I'll use it always.

338
00:28:06,698 --> 00:28:07,823
Thank you, Dick.

339
00:28:08,782 --> 00:28:10,157
Thank you very much.

340
00:28:11,907 --> 00:28:14,490
Well... good-bye.

341
00:28:15,490 --> 00:28:17,282
Well... good-bye.

342
00:28:26,115 --> 00:28:28,448
Would you mind very much
not going in with me?

343
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:32,198
I think I'd better be alone.
- Certainly. I quite understand.

344
00:28:37,448 --> 00:28:39,407
This is for you, Mr. Hobbs.

345
00:28:48,823 --> 00:28:50,865
It'll look fine when you're smoking it.

346
00:28:54,073 --> 00:28:55,198
Why, Ceddie...

347
00:28:56,448 --> 00:28:58,907
That's just what I wanted for a long time.

348
00:28:59,948 --> 00:29:02,407
This is my real present, Mr. Hobbs.

349
00:29:23,115 --> 00:29:26,282
There's something written on it -
inside the case.

350
00:29:27,282 --> 00:29:30,657
I told the man what to say. You read it.

351
00:29:36,657 --> 00:29:43,782
From his oldest friend,
Lord Fauntleroy, to Mr. Hobbs.

352
00:29:45,573 --> 00:29:49,115
When this you see, remember me.

353
00:29:55,407 --> 00:29:59,157
When this you see, remember me.

354
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:05,282
I don't want you to forget me.
- Oh, I won't forget you.

355
00:30:05,865 --> 00:30:09,698
Don't you go and forget me when you go
over there amongst those British aristocracy.

356
00:30:10,657 --> 00:30:15,323
I shouldn't forget you whoever I was
among. I hope you'll come to see me.

357
00:30:16,115 --> 00:30:18,948
Perhaps my grandfather
will write and invite you.

358
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:23,323
You - you wouldn't mind him
being an earl, would you?

359
00:30:23,573 --> 00:30:27,407
I mean, uh... you wouldn't stay away
just because he was one?

360
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:29,698
Oh, I'll come and see you.

361
00:30:33,490 --> 00:30:36,740
I... I won't be able to help myself.

362
00:31:20,907 --> 00:31:21,907
Cleared!

363
00:31:23,365 --> 00:31:24,365
Cleared!

364
00:31:54,448 --> 00:31:58,907
Is this Dorincourt Castle, Dearest?
- No. This is Court Lodge where your...

365
00:32:02,323 --> 00:32:05,407
There's Mary! We had a splendid
time in London, Mary.

366
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:12,448
I'm so glad you came before us, Mary.
We don't feel so strange,

367
00:32:12,532 --> 00:32:13,990
finding you here to welcome us.

368
00:32:14,073 --> 00:32:17,990
Sure 'tis the great happiness I wish you
ma'am, in your lovely, new home.

369
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:25,823
This is Mrs. Baines, the cook, ma'am,
and that's Susan, the parlor maid.

370
00:32:27,323 --> 00:32:31,698
I'm sure we'll do everything, ma'am,
to make ye comfortable.

371
00:32:31,782 --> 00:32:33,032
Oh, I'm sure you will.

372
00:32:40,657 --> 00:32:44,407
I must say good-bye. The carriage is
waiting to take me to the castle.

373
00:32:44,615 --> 00:32:48,823
I must tell the earl of your safe arrival.
- He needn't go tonight?

374
00:32:50,573 --> 00:32:53,532
I'd so like to have him with me
my first night here.

375
00:32:53,615 --> 00:32:56,990
No, I'm sure Lord Dorincourt
won't expect his grandson tonight.

376
00:32:57,282 --> 00:32:58,782
Tomorrow will be time enough.

377
00:33:00,823 --> 00:33:04,073
I dread so to tell him that we're not
going to live together anymore.

378
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:09,532
I'm a coward, I know,
putting it off so long, but

379
00:33:10,615 --> 00:33:14,323
it's the most difficult, the most
cruel thing I've ever had to do.

380
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:23,907
I wish you'd tell His Lordship that
I'd rather not have the money.

381
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,032
You mean the income he wishes
to settle on you?

382
00:33:27,657 --> 00:33:31,073
I have little money of my own
quite enough to live simply on.

383
00:33:31,532 --> 00:33:35,532
I must accept the house, because that makes
it possible for me to be near Ceddie.

384
00:33:35,907 --> 00:33:37,740
I'm grateful to him for that, but...

385
00:33:37,782 --> 00:33:41,157
He'll be very angry.
He won't understand it at all.

386
00:33:42,823 --> 00:33:44,823
I think he will understand.

387
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,657
He must understand that I can't
accept money from a man who...

388
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:57,323
hates me so much that he's separating me
from my boy. - I'll deliver your message.

389
00:34:11,073 --> 00:34:14,448
I think it's beautiful here,
don't you Dearest?

390
00:34:19,323 --> 00:34:23,490
Ceddie, darlin', there's something
I must tell you.

391
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,782
You're not going to understand it, I know,

392
00:34:27,198 --> 00:34:31,448
but I want you to believe me as you
always have when I tell you it's for the best.

393
00:34:34,573 --> 00:34:38,615
Tomorrow, Mr. Havisham will take you
to your grandfather

394
00:34:39,282 --> 00:34:43,532
and you will live with him at the
castle. I shall not go with you.

395
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:49,948
This pretty house will be my home, and
Mary will be here to look after me.

396
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:53,823
But Dearest you don't mean

397
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:56,490
you can't mean that

398
00:34:56,907 --> 00:35:00,115
we're not going to be together
just as we've always been?

399
00:35:01,282 --> 00:35:04,532
Oh, no! I can't! I couldn't!

400
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:07,573
I won't! I won't!

401
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,532
Ceddie, you must be brave and sensible.

402
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:19,948
If there are some things you can't
understand now, you'll understand them later.

403
00:35:22,407 --> 00:35:26,490
It's best for you to live there. There...
there are good reasons why it tis.

404
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:33,823
You mean, you want me to go away from you?
- Of course not, darling.

405
00:35:35,740 --> 00:35:39,532
But now you're growing older and we
must trust and help one another,

406
00:35:39,573 --> 00:35:41,365
without asking any questions.

407
00:35:43,573 --> 00:35:47,448
And you know, Ceddie, your grandfather
loves you and wants you to love him.

408
00:35:48,115 --> 00:35:51,907
He's so kind he... he wants you to be
happy and to make other people happy.

409
00:35:52,615 --> 00:35:57,032
But Dearest, I can't be happy without you.

410
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,782
But you won't be without me all the time.

411
00:36:01,032 --> 00:36:05,365
I'm not far from the castle here and
you'll run in and see me every day.

412
00:36:05,990 --> 00:36:10,657
You'll love the castle and there'll always
be something new and interesting to tell me.

413
00:36:10,907 --> 00:36:15,532
And I'll have things to tell you! Oh,
Ceddie, we'll have such good times together!

414
00:36:16,198 --> 00:36:21,490
We'll be finding things out,
both of us. We'll be explorers.

415
00:36:22,657 --> 00:36:26,907
Yes. Like... like Mr. Stanley
and Mr. Livingston.

416
00:36:27,948 --> 00:36:29,615
That'll be exciting.

417
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:38,573
And every night when it grows dark,
I'll put a candle in the window

418
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:42,157
to guide you through
the jungle, Mr. Stanley.

419
00:37:26,115 --> 00:37:30,073
Ah, Newick. How's His Lordship?
- He's in the rare mood!

420
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:32,907
He told me to evict all the tenants
if they weren't paid up.

421
00:37:32,990 --> 00:37:35,698
I dare say, that'll be a job
to your liking.

422
00:37:43,407 --> 00:37:47,282
Oh, sir.
- Ah, Purvis, glad to see you again.

423
00:37:47,323 --> 00:37:49,407
Very glad to see you, sir.

424
00:37:50,907 --> 00:37:54,657
Fool! Idiot! Do what you're told,
bring what's ordered!

425
00:37:56,365 --> 00:37:58,948
Gout?
- Oh, yes, sir.

426
00:37:59,073 --> 00:38:02,782
These last few weeks have been
the worst I've ever known, sir.

427
00:38:04,407 --> 00:38:09,157
I'm surrounded by a lot of incompetent
nincompoops! Shut the door, you blockhead!

428
00:38:10,615 --> 00:38:12,865
I can't stand 'im no longer, Mr. Purvis.

429
00:38:12,948 --> 00:38:16,073
He's too much for any man - cursin',
swearin' and callin' people out

430
00:38:16,157 --> 00:38:19,073
of other names like 'e does.
It ain't just today, it's every day!

431
00:38:19,157 --> 00:38:23,157
Thomas, you brought him the '63 port.
He prefers the '51.

432
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:26,490
'Ow was I to know? He didn't say!
- Fetch the other bottle!

433
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:29,323
W'at business has 'e got drinking'
Port anyway in 'is condition!

434
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:35,948
I can't feed and house every lout
in the parish and I won't!

435
00:38:36,073 --> 00:38:39,032
You and your poor - I've had
enough of 'em! - But, my lord...

436
00:38:39,157 --> 00:38:41,240
Mr. Mordaunt is with him.

437
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:46,573
I've said all I have to say, now, good
night! - Good day, my lord... good day.

438
00:38:46,657 --> 00:38:47,573
I beg your pardon.

439
00:38:47,657 --> 00:38:49,407
How'd you do, Mr. Havisham?

440
00:38:49,698 --> 00:38:50,698
Yes, ah, Mr. Mordaunt.

441
00:38:51,573 --> 00:38:53,990
Mr. Havisham, my lord.

442
00:39:05,157 --> 00:39:08,032
Well, Havisham. - My lord.
- Come back, have you?

443
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,782
Put that cushion right for me, will you?

444
00:39:11,865 --> 00:39:13,532
Aie! Aie! Careful!

445
00:39:19,157 --> 00:39:22,657
That foot's full of hot needles!

446
00:39:23,782 --> 00:39:25,615
Well, what have you got to tell me?

447
00:39:25,948 --> 00:39:28,240
Lord Fauntleroy and his mother
are at Court Lodge.

448
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:31,157
They bore the voyage excellently,
and in good health.

449
00:39:31,240 --> 00:39:34,823
Ah... what else? - His Lordship remains
with his mother tonight.

450
00:39:34,907 --> 00:39:38,115
I'll bring him to the castle tomorrow.
- Well, go on! Tell me everything!

451
00:39:38,323 --> 00:39:42,698
Never mind about the mother.
What sort of a lad is he, I say?

452
00:39:42,865 --> 00:39:46,573
It's rather difficult to judge the
character of a child of nine.

453
00:39:46,698 --> 00:39:48,948
A fool, huh? A clumsy cub?

454
00:39:49,823 --> 00:39:53,157
I don't know much about the children,
but I thought him rather a fine lad.

455
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,948
Healthy, well grown, eh?

456
00:39:55,032 --> 00:39:58,948
Apparently healthy, quite well grown.
- Straight limbed? Well enough to look at?

457
00:39:59,615 --> 00:40:02,407
Rather handsome, my lord - as boys go.
- Ah.

458
00:40:03,073 --> 00:40:05,323
Although I'm... I'm scarcely a judge.

459
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,823
I dare say you will find him a little
different from most English children.

460
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:15,282
No doubt of that! American children are the most
impudent and the worst brought up in the world.

461
00:40:15,657 --> 00:40:20,698
I've heard that often enough.
- I would hardly call it impudent.

462
00:40:21,282 --> 00:40:24,865
The difference is, that he has lived more
with older people than with children

463
00:40:24,948 --> 00:40:29,573
and I should call it a mixture
of maturity and childishness. - Exactly!

464
00:40:29,990 --> 00:40:32,907
Beastly impudent bad manners -
that what it tis!

465
00:40:32,990 --> 00:40:36,573
I have a message
to deliver from Mrs. Errol.

466
00:40:36,615 --> 00:40:40,032
I want none of her messages!
The less I hear, the better!

467
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:42,032
Ah, but this is rather an important one.

468
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:46,490
She prefers not to accept the income
you propose to settle on her.

469
00:40:49,032 --> 00:40:51,198
What's that? What d'you say?

470
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:55,365
She says it's not necessary that as the
relations between you are not...

471
00:40:55,448 --> 00:40:57,657
not friendly...
- Not friendly!

472
00:40:57,907 --> 00:40:59,657
I should say they were not friendly!

473
00:41:00,407 --> 00:41:02,240
Mercenary, sharp-voiced American!

474
00:41:04,657 --> 00:41:07,740
My lord, you could hardly call
her mercenary. She's asked for nothing!

475
00:41:07,823 --> 00:41:11,823
Nah... all done for effect! She thinks
she can wheedle me into seeing her.

476
00:41:11,907 --> 00:41:16,865
Thinks I shall admire her spirit but
I don't! Have the money sent to her.

477
00:41:16,948 --> 00:41:21,448
She won't spend it. - I don't care whether she
spends it! She shall have it sent to her.

478
00:41:21,907 --> 00:41:26,073
She shan't tell people she's to live as a
pauper because I'm doing nothing for her!

479
00:41:30,865 --> 00:41:33,907
I suppose she's poisoning
the boy's mind against me too.

480
00:41:34,157 --> 00:41:37,657
No, I have another message that will
prove she's not done that.

481
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:40,198
I won't hear... Ow! Oh! Ah!

482
00:41:44,073 --> 00:41:48,698
She asks you not to let Lord Fauntleroy
hear anything that might lead him

483
00:41:48,782 --> 00:41:53,448
to understand that you are separating him
from her because of your prejudice against her.

484
00:41:53,907 --> 00:41:55,865
She says he wouldn't comprehend it.

485
00:41:55,948 --> 00:41:59,240
That it might make him fear you in some
measure, or at least,

486
00:41:59,323 --> 00:42:01,365
cause him to feel less affection for you.

487
00:42:01,782 --> 00:42:05,073
She wants there to be no shadow
on your first meeting.

488
00:42:05,157 --> 00:42:09,490
Come now, Havisham, come now!
You don't mean that mother hasn't told him?

489
00:42:09,698 --> 00:42:14,032
Not a word, my lord. Nothing has been said
to the boy to give him the slightest doubt

490
00:42:14,115 --> 00:42:15,115
of your perfection.

491
00:42:17,282 --> 00:42:21,115
He's prepared to believe you the most
amiable and affectionate of grandparents.

492
00:42:21,948 --> 00:42:24,948
In fact, he already regards you
as a wonder of generosity.

493
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:31,615
Uh!

494
00:42:32,073 --> 00:42:33,073
He does, eh?

495
00:42:36,948 --> 00:42:41,032
I would suggest, my lord,
that Fauntleroy's impressions of you

496
00:42:41,115 --> 00:42:42,865
depend entirely upon yourself.

497
00:42:43,615 --> 00:42:45,157
I make a further suggestion

498
00:42:45,865 --> 00:42:49,990
you will succeed better with him if you
take care not to speak slightingly to him

499
00:42:50,032 --> 00:42:52,407
of his mother.
- The boy's only nine.

500
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:56,490
Nevertheless, those nine years have
been spent at his mother's side.

501
00:42:57,032 --> 00:42:58,782
She has all his affection.

502
00:43:00,407 --> 00:43:01,407
Hmm...

503
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:07,823
So he thinks me generous, eh!

504
00:43:46,448 --> 00:43:49,407
Ah, Purvis, this is Lord Fauntleroy.

505
00:43:49,490 --> 00:43:53,282
My lord. - How do you do?
- Thank you, my lord.

506
00:44:10,157 --> 00:44:11,157
My lord.

507
00:44:17,157 --> 00:44:19,407
This is Lord Fauntleroy, Mrs. Mellon.

508
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:23,573
Lord Fauntleroy, this is Mrs. Mellon,
the housekeeper. - How do you do, ma'am?

509
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:28,490
I should know His Lordship anywhere, sir.
He has the Captain's face and way.

510
00:44:29,157 --> 00:44:33,573
Oh, was it you who sent the cat?
I'm ever so obliged to you, ma'am.

511
00:44:34,990 --> 00:44:35,990
How do you do?

512
00:44:38,282 --> 00:44:40,448
It is a great day this, sir?

513
00:44:40,532 --> 00:44:42,948
Where is His Lordship?
- In the library, sir.

514
00:44:43,323 --> 00:44:45,698
Lord Fauntleroy is to be
sent to him alone.

515
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:07,740
Lord Fauntleroy, my lord.

516
00:45:23,282 --> 00:45:25,323
Dougal! Come back here!

517
00:45:33,240 --> 00:45:34,573
How do you do, sir?

518
00:45:49,323 --> 00:45:55,573
Are you the earl? I'm your grandson that
Mr. Havisham brought. I'm Lord Fauntleroy.

519
00:46:01,865 --> 00:46:03,615
I hope you are quite well.

520
00:46:04,115 --> 00:46:06,407
I'm very glad to see you.
- Hunh!

521
00:46:06,865 --> 00:46:09,990
You're glad to see me, are ya?
- Yes, very.

522
00:46:17,490 --> 00:46:21,782
I kept wondering what you would look
like if you'd be like my father.

523
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:27,490
Oh, and am I? - Well, I don't think you
are, very. - You're disappointed, I suppose.

524
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,907
Oh, no! Of course you would enjoy the way
your grandfather looked,

525
00:46:31,990 --> 00:46:36,073
even if he wasn't like your father.
You know how it is yourself,

526
00:46:36,157 --> 00:46:40,573
about admiring your relations.
- Eh? I'm not sure that I do.

527
00:46:40,782 --> 00:46:44,198
Any boy would love his grandfather,
especially one who's been

528
00:46:44,282 --> 00:46:48,032
as kind to him as you've been.
- I've been kind to you, have I?

529
00:46:48,115 --> 00:46:52,532
Yes. I'm ever so obliged to you about
Bridget, and the apple woman, and Dick.

530
00:46:52,615 --> 00:46:56,948
Bridget? Dick? Apple woman?
- They were particular friends of mine.

531
00:46:57,073 --> 00:46:59,823
The ones you gave me all that money for,

532
00:46:59,907 --> 00:47:02,907
the money you told Mr. Havisham
to give me if I wanted it.

533
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:08,823
The money you were to spend as you liked, eh?
So, you spend it all on these people, did ya?

534
00:47:08,907 --> 00:47:11,615
Bridget, Dick, and the apple woman?

535
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:15,657
Yes, and I gave Mr. Hobbs
a gold watch and chain, and a pipe.

536
00:47:16,573 --> 00:47:22,823
I put some poetry in the watch.
It was: "When this you see, remember me."

537
00:47:25,573 --> 00:47:30,157
I'm going to miss Mr. Hobbs very much.
- Who is Mr. Hobbs?

538
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:36,240
He was our grocer - fancy vegetables and
groceries, you know. He's my closest friend.

539
00:47:37,282 --> 00:47:39,573
Mr. Hobbs is a very clever man.

540
00:47:39,657 --> 00:47:43,740
Do you know, he can recite the Declaration
of Independence right through.

541
00:47:44,782 --> 00:47:46,948
Oh!
- What's the matter?

542
00:47:48,823 --> 00:47:52,698
I just remembered you might not like to
hear about the Declaration of Independence.

543
00:47:52,782 --> 00:47:55,907
I forgot you were an Englishman.
- Hunh! You forgot!

544
00:47:55,990 --> 00:47:59,407
You were English too, didn't ye?
- Oh, no! I'm an American!

545
00:47:59,490 --> 00:48:04,240
You are English! Your father was
an Englishman. - I was born in America.

546
00:48:04,323 --> 00:48:06,907
You have to be an American
if you are born in America.

547
00:48:07,573 --> 00:48:10,698
You don't... - I beg your
pardon for contradicting you.

548
00:48:11,198 --> 00:48:15,157
Mr. Hobbs says if there's ever to be another
war, that I should have to be an American.

549
00:48:16,032 --> 00:48:19,490
I promised him if there were another
war, I should try to stop it.

550
00:48:19,532 --> 00:48:21,282
You would, would you? Ha, ha.

551
00:48:22,573 --> 00:48:24,323
Dinner is served, my lord.

552
00:48:27,573 --> 00:48:28,407
Ugh!

553
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:31,240
Now, be careful, man... be careful!

554
00:48:32,073 --> 00:48:33,198
Careful now, careful.

555
00:48:34,782 --> 00:48:35,615
Ow!

556
00:48:37,865 --> 00:48:41,365
Would you like me to help you?
You can lean on me.

557
00:48:41,407 --> 00:48:44,865
Once Mr. Hobbs hurt his foot with a potato
barrel falling on it.

558
00:48:44,907 --> 00:48:47,865
He used to lean on me.
- Do you think you could do it?

559
00:48:47,948 --> 00:48:51,240
I think I could. I'm very strong.
I'm nine, you know.

560
00:48:51,573 --> 00:48:56,532
Lean on your stick on one side and on me
on the other. - Well... you may try it.

561
00:49:00,573 --> 00:49:03,990
Just lean on me. I'll walk very slowly.

562
00:49:06,198 --> 00:49:09,782
Don't be afraid of leaning on me.
I'm all right.

563
00:49:10,323 --> 00:49:12,198
If it isn't a very long way.

564
00:49:14,948 --> 00:49:19,615
D'you see that old fellow in red velvet?
He was the tenth earl of Dorincourt.

565
00:49:21,948 --> 00:49:27,782
King George I decorated him for services
during the war with Spain and Austria.

566
00:49:28,407 --> 00:49:33,448
He was tremendously strong, could bend
a bar of iron between his hands.

567
00:49:34,157 --> 00:49:38,698
You get your strength from him.
- How... how very int'resting.

568
00:49:40,948 --> 00:49:46,073
Did you ever try putting your foot in hot
water and mustard? Mr. Hobbs used to.

569
00:49:46,448 --> 00:49:48,490
Arnica is a good thing too, they tell me.

570
00:49:48,573 --> 00:49:51,198
Ah, thank ye. I'll try it.

571
00:50:09,157 --> 00:50:13,282
It's warm, isn't it? A person can't
help getting warm in the summertime.

572
00:50:16,782 --> 00:50:21,615
Great heavens! What's that? - It's a
present from Dick. Isn't it beautiful?

573
00:50:23,115 --> 00:50:25,323
When this I see, I...

574
00:50:26,365 --> 00:50:27,698
I shall always remember Dick.

575
00:50:30,365 --> 00:50:35,115
Yes, I should think you would.
It would be difficult to forget him.

576
00:50:36,698 --> 00:50:40,448
Dick's a professional bootblack.
You'd like him. He's so square.

577
00:50:41,157 --> 00:50:46,573
Square? - Yes, he wouldn't cheat anyone
or hit a boy under his size.

578
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:49,282
Oh. Very praiseworthy.

579
00:50:52,107 --> 00:50:53,907
Thank ye.

580
00:50:59,573 --> 00:51:03,323
What's the matter?
Don't you like your soup? - Oh, yes.

581
00:51:05,115 --> 00:51:08,698
I was just wondering.
- Wondering? Wondering what?

582
00:51:09,698 --> 00:51:12,532
You don't wear your coronet
all the time, then?

583
00:51:14,740 --> 00:51:18,157
No, no. It, er, it doesn't become me.

584
00:51:19,657 --> 00:51:21,907
Mr. Hobbs said you wore it all the time.

585
00:51:23,657 --> 00:51:28,282
After he thought it over, he said you must
take it off sometimes to put your hat on.

586
00:51:33,073 --> 00:51:34,323
Yes, I, ah...

587
00:51:35,490 --> 00:51:37,407
I take it off occasionally.

588
00:51:47,948 --> 00:51:52,157
You must be very proud of your house.
I never saw anything so beautiful.

589
00:51:52,532 --> 00:51:55,490
It's a very big house for just two people
to live in, isn't it?

590
00:51:55,532 --> 00:51:57,948
Do you think it's too large?

591
00:51:58,490 --> 00:52:02,157
I was only thinking that if two people
lived in it who were not good companions,

592
00:52:02,240 --> 00:52:06,698
they might get a little lonely. - Do you
think I shall make a good companion?

593
00:52:06,948 --> 00:52:12,948
Yes, I think you will. I think you should be
almost as interesting as Mr. Hobbs. - Oh.

594
00:52:14,657 --> 00:52:19,448
Mr. Hobbs and I were very great friends.
He was the best friend I had expect...

595
00:52:26,157 --> 00:52:31,657
Fauntleroy, what are you thinking of?
- I was thinking of Dearest.

596
00:52:32,532 --> 00:52:36,323
Who is Dearest?
- She is my mother.

597
00:52:40,615 --> 00:52:45,115
I... I think I'd better get up
and... and walk up and down.

598
00:52:55,907 --> 00:52:59,115
He's a very nice dog. He's my friend.

599
00:53:00,282 --> 00:53:02,282
He knows how I feel.

600
00:53:03,573 --> 00:53:05,032
How do you feel?

601
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:12,282
Come here.

602
00:53:27,365 --> 00:53:32,282
You see, I... I never was away
from my own house before.

603
00:53:33,282 --> 00:53:37,573
It... it makes a person feel a strange
feeling when he has to stay all night

604
00:53:37,657 --> 00:53:40,573
in another person's castle,
instead of his own house.

605
00:53:42,032 --> 00:53:47,115
But... but Dearest is not very far away
from me. She told me to remember that.

606
00:53:48,115 --> 00:53:50,490
And, after all, you know,
I'm nine, you know

607
00:53:51,490 --> 00:53:53,698
and I can look at the picture she gave me.

608
00:53:55,740 --> 00:54:00,573
Look! You press this spring
and it opens and there she is!

609
00:54:16,490 --> 00:54:21,365
I suppose you think you're very fond of her?
- Yes, I do think so and it's true.

610
00:54:22,657 --> 00:54:27,407
Mr. Hobbs and the others were my friends,
but Dearest is my close friends.

611
00:54:28,157 --> 00:54:30,823
My father left her to me to take care of.

612
00:54:32,115 --> 00:54:35,823
And when I'm a man, I'm going to
work and earn money for her.

613
00:54:35,907 --> 00:54:37,865
Oh, and what do you think of doing?

614
00:54:38,657 --> 00:54:42,157
Well, I did think of going
into business with Mr. Hobbs

615
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:45,323
but I should like to be president.

616
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,323
We'll send you to
the House of Lords instead.

617
00:54:50,448 --> 00:54:54,698
Well, if I couldn't be president and if
that's a good business, I shouldn't mind.

618
00:54:55,615 --> 00:54:58,532
The grocery business is dull sometimes.

619
00:54:59,573 --> 00:55:03,073
Yes, so is the House of Lords,
but it's the business

620
00:55:03,157 --> 00:55:08,782
that every earl of Dorincourt goes into.
- I shall have to talk to Dearest about it.

621
00:55:45,448 --> 00:55:46,490
Good night.

622
00:55:48,198 --> 00:55:50,365
God keep you all the night.

623
00:55:54,365 --> 00:55:56,073
Morning, Thomas.
- Good morning, sir.

624
00:55:56,157 --> 00:55:59,907
Where's His Lordship?
- In his library, sir and such goings on

625
00:55:59,990 --> 00:56:02,782
I've never heard in my life!
- Do you think, it'll be all right?

626
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:05,490
Yes sir, he's expecting you.
- Oh!

627
00:56:12,490 --> 00:56:13,490
Ah-ha.

628
00:56:20,365 --> 00:56:21,365
Oh... ha, ha.

629
00:56:22,865 --> 00:56:23,865
Ah...

630
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,282
Morning, Mordaunt.
I've found a new employment, you see.

631
00:56:28,573 --> 00:56:31,073
Any good at marbles, Mordaunt?

632
00:56:31,365 --> 00:56:35,823
My muscles are a little stiff, my lord,
but... I'll see what I can do.

633
00:56:35,865 --> 00:56:38,657
Hah, pity about that!
I'd forgotten about your age.

634
00:56:38,782 --> 00:56:39,948
Ha, ha, ha.

635
00:56:41,323 --> 00:56:42,823
Ouch! Oh!

636
00:56:43,823 --> 00:56:45,490
This is the new Lord Fauntleroy.

637
00:56:45,865 --> 00:56:48,865
Fauntleroy, this is Mr. Mordaunt,
rector of the parish.

638
00:56:49,157 --> 00:56:51,407
I'm very glad to make
your acquaintance, sir.

639
00:56:51,490 --> 00:56:54,657
I'm delighted to make
your acquaintance, Lord Fauntleroy.

640
00:56:54,698 --> 00:56:57,490
Well, what is it this morning,
Mordaunt? Who's in trouble now?

641
00:56:57,823 --> 00:57:01,115
It's one of your tenants,
my lord. Higgins of Edge Farm.

642
00:57:01,282 --> 00:57:04,657
Newick has told him that if he doesn't
pay the rent he must leave the place.

643
00:57:05,448 --> 00:57:09,073
He's a bad tenant, always behind,
Newick tells me.

644
00:57:09,157 --> 00:57:13,282
He's devoted to his wife and children,
and if the farm is taken from him,

645
00:57:13,365 --> 00:57:16,948
they may literally starve.
- That's like Michael!

646
00:57:18,282 --> 00:57:21,990
I forgot we had a philanthropist here.

647
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:24,990
Come here.

648
00:57:28,532 --> 00:57:30,282
What would you do in this case?

649
00:57:30,490 --> 00:57:34,573
If I were very rich, I should let him stay
and give him things for his children.

650
00:57:34,740 --> 00:57:38,782
Nonsense! You're Lord Fauntleroy. It's time
you learned to deal with these situations.

651
00:57:40,407 --> 00:57:43,573
You can write, can't ya?
- Yes, but not very well.

652
00:57:43,657 --> 00:57:46,323
Well, go over to the desk
and write Newick his orders.

653
00:57:52,323 --> 00:57:55,740
Now, what must I say?
- You must say:

654
00:57:57,073 --> 00:57:59,948
Higgins is not to be interfered
with for the present.

655
00:58:01,865 --> 00:58:02,865
Oh!

656
00:58:06,740 --> 00:58:08,323
And sign it, "Fauntleroy."

657
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,448
Do you think it will do?

658
00:58:15,532 --> 00:58:21,532
Dear mr. Newik if you pleas mr. Higins is
not to be inturfeared with for the present

659
00:58:21,615 --> 00:58:23,615
and oblige. Yours rispecferly

660
00:58:23,698 --> 00:58:24,782
"FAUNTLEROY."

661
00:58:25,990 --> 00:58:26,990
Yes.

662
00:58:27,448 --> 00:58:30,282
Higgins will find it
entirely satisfactory.

663
00:58:30,865 --> 00:58:35,157
Mr. Hobbs always signed his letters that
way and I thought I'd better say "please."

664
00:58:36,032 --> 00:58:38,907
Is that exactly the right
way to spell "interfered?"

665
00:58:39,240 --> 00:58:43,115
Well, it's not exactly the way it's
spelled in the dictionary, but...

666
00:58:43,407 --> 00:58:44,948
I was afraid of that.

667
00:58:45,115 --> 00:58:47,823
Yes, Higgins won't
complain of the spelling.

668
00:58:48,073 --> 00:58:52,365
I think you must be the best person in the
whole world, don't you, Mr. Mordaunt?

669
00:58:53,990 --> 00:58:55,907
I shall write and tell Mr. Hobbs.

670
00:58:56,407 --> 00:58:57,990
Oh, what'll you tell him?

671
00:58:58,198 --> 00:59:01,407
I shall tell him I think you're the
kindest man I ever heard of,

672
00:59:01,823 --> 00:59:05,073
and that you're always thinking of other
people and making them happy and...

673
00:59:10,573 --> 00:59:13,365
and that I hope when I grow up
I shall be just like you!

674
00:59:14,907 --> 00:59:16,157
Just like me, eh?

675
00:59:18,948 --> 00:59:23,657
There you are, Mordaunt. Take that with
you. - I will indeed. This is good news!

676
00:59:23,948 --> 00:59:26,573
Thank you, my lord. - Oh, don't
thank me, thank Fauntleroy.

677
00:59:28,115 --> 00:59:31,157
Thank you.
- Good-bye, sir. - Good-bye.

678
00:59:38,490 --> 00:59:43,240
May I go to see Dearest now?
I think she'll be waiting for me.

679
00:59:43,282 --> 00:59:46,615
There's something for you to see
in the stables first. Ring the bell.

680
00:59:46,698 --> 00:59:48,365
In the stables!

681
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:56,240
If you please, I'm very much obliged,
but I think I'd better see it tomorrow.

682
00:59:56,865 --> 01:00:01,823
She'll be expecting me all the time.
- Ah, very well. We'll order the carriage.

683
01:00:04,032 --> 01:00:08,115
You don't care to see what's
in the stables? - Oh, I do! I do!

684
01:00:08,948 --> 01:00:11,448
Oh, it doesn't matter, it's only a pony.

685
01:00:14,198 --> 01:00:17,532
A pony! Whose pony is it?
- Yours.

686
01:00:18,448 --> 01:00:20,032
Mine!
- Yes.

687
01:00:21,282 --> 01:00:24,782
Oh, I never thought I'd have
a pony! I never thought that!

688
01:00:25,115 --> 01:00:27,198
How glad Dearest will be.

689
01:00:29,365 --> 01:00:31,240
You give me everything, don't you?

690
01:00:32,448 --> 01:00:33,657
Wouldn't you like to see it?

691
01:00:34,698 --> 01:00:39,282
Of course I want to see it! I want
to see it so much I can hardly wait

692
01:00:41,407 --> 01:00:43,948
but I'm afraid there isn't time.

693
01:00:47,532 --> 01:00:51,573
You must see your mother this afternoon?
You can't put it off till tomorrow?

694
01:00:52,532 --> 01:00:57,073
Why, she's been thinking about me all the
morning and I've been thinking about her.

695
01:00:57,157 --> 01:00:58,573
Oh, you have, have you?

696
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:02,240
Very well, ring the bell.

697
01:01:24,490 --> 01:01:28,823
Let me give you your stick. Lean on me
when you get out. - I'm not going to get out.

698
01:01:30,323 --> 01:01:34,532
Not... not to see Dearest?
- Dearest will excuse me.

699
01:01:35,282 --> 01:01:38,115
Tell her that even your new pony
would keep you away.

700
01:01:44,032 --> 01:01:45,573
She'll be disappointed.

701
01:01:46,365 --> 01:01:49,323
She'll want to see you very much.
- I am afraid not.

702
01:01:50,532 --> 01:01:53,865
The carriage will call for you as we
come back. Drive on, Jeffries.

703
01:02:18,490 --> 01:02:21,782
It's a shame, parted from his own mother.

704
01:02:22,407 --> 01:02:26,782
Cook at Court Lodge was telling Sarah
she'd never worked for a sweeter lady

705
01:02:26,865 --> 01:02:27,865
than Mrs. Errol.

706
01:02:28,532 --> 01:02:31,532
The letter was written by the
little gentleman his own self.

707
01:02:32,073 --> 01:02:39,740
Signed with his name too, "Fauntleroy,"
as large as life. - The little precious!

708
01:02:39,907 --> 01:02:43,115
Ay, that's the mother.
- A pretty young thing too.

709
01:02:45,782 --> 01:02:47,198
Good morning, my lady.
- Good morning.

710
01:02:48,865 --> 01:02:50,698
God bless you, ma'am.
- Thank you.

711
01:02:52,990 --> 01:02:54,615
Good morning.
- Good morning.

712
01:02:57,407 --> 01:03:01,198
It's His Lordship coming to services.
That's a new notion.

713
01:03:08,032 --> 01:03:10,282
They say even 'is gout's improving.

714
01:03:10,365 --> 01:03:14,573
An' look at the young lord.
- He's captain Cedric all over again.

715
01:03:14,823 --> 01:03:17,115
He's the Captain's self to the life.

716
01:03:19,865 --> 01:03:22,115
How glad the people are to see you.

717
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:25,407
Take off your hat, Fauntleroy.
They're bowing to you. - To me?

718
01:03:28,032 --> 01:03:29,032
How do you do?

719
01:03:32,282 --> 01:03:35,115
God bless, Your Lordship. Long life to ya.

720
01:03:35,782 --> 01:03:36,782
Thank you.

721
01:03:38,740 --> 01:03:40,032
Good morning, my lord.

722
01:04:24,407 --> 01:04:27,698
Crown Him with many crowns

723
01:04:28,323 --> 01:04:32,448
The Lamb upon His throne

724
01:04:33,198 --> 01:04:38,282
Hark! How the heavenly anthem drowns

725
01:04:38,573 --> 01:04:42,573
All music but his own

726
01:04:43,490 --> 01:04:47,740
Awake my soul, and sign

727
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:52,782
Of Him who died for thee

728
01:04:53,448 --> 01:04:58,282
And Hail Him as thy matchless King

729
01:04:58,698 --> 01:05:03,032
Through all eternity

730
01:05:05,490 --> 01:05:09,490
Crown Him the Virgin's son

731
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,323
The God incarnate born

732
01:05:15,073 --> 01:05:19,865
Whose arm those crimson trophies won...

733
01:05:20,740 --> 01:05:24,448
May I whisper?
- What is it? - Who are they?

734
01:05:28,532 --> 01:05:33,865
Some of your ancestors who lived
a few hundred years ago. - Oh!

735
01:05:35,115 --> 01:05:37,115
Perhaps I got my spelling from them.

736
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:42,448
Shepherd King of Israel's fold

737
01:05:42,532 --> 01:05:46,532
The Babe of Bethlehem

738
01:05:52,907 --> 01:05:55,282
Well, Higgins?
- Oh, is this Mr. Higgins?

739
01:05:56,198 --> 01:05:59,907
Yes, I suppose he's come to look
at his new landlord. - Yes, my lord.

740
01:06:00,282 --> 01:06:03,948
I understand His young Lordship
was kind enough to speak for me

741
01:06:04,032 --> 01:06:06,073
and I thought I'd like to say
a word of thanks.

742
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:09,782
I've got a great deal
to thank Your Lordship for.

743
01:06:10,115 --> 01:06:13,657
Oh, I only wrote the letter.
It's my grandfather who did it.

744
01:06:13,823 --> 01:06:16,282
You know how good he always is to people.

745
01:06:16,490 --> 01:06:20,323
Is Mrs. Higgins well now?
- Yes, Your Lordship.

746
01:06:20,823 --> 01:06:24,073
The Missus is better since
the trouble was took off her mind.

747
01:06:24,698 --> 01:06:28,448
My grandfather was very sorry about
your children having the scarlet fever.

748
01:06:29,823 --> 01:06:33,240
You see, Higgins, you people
have all been mistaken about me.

749
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:38,157
Lord Fauntleroy understands me. If you
want a little reliable information

750
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,073
on the subject of my character, apply to him.

751
01:06:42,115 --> 01:06:43,865
Get into the carriage, Fauntleroy.

752
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:13,657
You miss your mother very much?
- Yes, sir. I miss her all the time.

753
01:07:16,032 --> 01:07:19,365
You don't miss her, do you?
- I don't know her.

754
01:07:20,532 --> 01:07:23,365
I know and that's what makes me wonder.

755
01:07:23,948 --> 01:07:26,823
She told me not to ask
any questions, and I won't.

756
01:07:26,907 --> 01:07:30,782
Well, you see her almost every day,
don't ye? Isn't that enough?

757
01:07:31,990 --> 01:07:35,948
We used to see each other all the time
and we could tell each other things

758
01:07:36,032 --> 01:07:37,365
without waiting.

759
01:07:37,490 --> 01:07:41,698
Well, don't you ever forget
about her? - No, sir. Never.

760
01:07:42,990 --> 01:07:45,240
I shouldn't forget about you, you know.

761
01:07:46,573 --> 01:07:51,532
If I didn't live with you I should
think about you all the more.

762
01:07:56,698 --> 01:07:58,490
Upon my word I believe you would!

763
01:08:10,990 --> 01:08:13,532
My Dear Mr. Hobbs.

764
01:08:13,615 --> 01:08:18,823
I must tell you about
my grandfather immediately.

765
01:08:18,907 --> 01:08:25,323
It's all a mistake earls being
tyrants. He's not the tyrant.

766
01:08:25,407 --> 01:08:30,740
He has the gout in his
foot and is a great suffer.

767
01:08:30,865 --> 01:08:36,990
He is such a good earl. He reminds
me of you. He is a universal favorite.

768
01:08:38,615 --> 01:08:41,365
Well... Reminds me of you...

769
01:08:41,865 --> 01:08:45,990
Think of that, now. He's known this
earl only a little while, and we...

770
01:08:46,990 --> 01:08:49,073
We was lifetime acquaintances.

771
01:08:50,323 --> 01:08:53,323
I don't know as I want him to be
reminded of me by this earl.

772
01:08:53,615 --> 01:08:56,657
They been usin' influence of
him, I betcha. - You're right.

773
01:08:57,407 --> 01:08:59,657
They got twisty ways, those aristocrats!

774
01:09:00,115 --> 01:09:02,990
They'd wheedle their little finger around
your heart as soon as look at you,

775
01:09:03,198 --> 01:09:05,157
all for their own purposes, mind!

776
01:09:05,615 --> 01:09:09,032
It's a pity they're makin'
an eril outta him. - Yeah...

777
01:09:10,323 --> 01:09:14,865
He would have been a shinin' light in
grocery business, a shinin' light!

778
01:09:15,990 --> 01:09:19,240
You know any particklars 'bout dat
stuff like castles and erils?

779
01:09:20,073 --> 01:09:23,323
No, not much,
except they're haughty and mean.

780
01:09:25,490 --> 01:09:29,907
Sure is a jim-dandy letter he wrote. Almost
as good as seein' him only it ain't o' course.

781
01:09:30,198 --> 01:09:35,073
Aw, he was a plumb-daisy of a kid. I betcha
sometimes he wishes he was back here.

782
01:09:35,990 --> 01:09:38,573
I do.
- You lonely?

783
01:09:39,157 --> 01:09:42,032
Aw, not so bad.
- Where you livin' now?

784
01:09:42,490 --> 01:09:45,282
Me an' two udder fellas, we got a room
in a lodgin' house.

785
01:09:45,532 --> 01:09:48,157
The udder two get drunk and
fightin' but it's cheap.

786
01:09:48,448 --> 01:09:51,823
That's no sort of a place
for a lad like you to be livin'.

787
01:09:52,240 --> 01:09:56,032
Now, look here, I gotta clean,
dry loft over my stable

788
01:09:56,240 --> 01:09:59,990
and there's an old bed you can have.
Why don't you come here and stay?

789
01:10:00,740 --> 01:10:04,698
It won't cost you a cent.
- Chee! D'ya mean dat, Mr. Hobbs?

790
01:10:04,782 --> 01:10:07,115
Why, I certainly do.
- Ya... hoo!

791
01:10:07,198 --> 01:10:10,198
Chee, Mr. Hobbs! Talking about erils -
you ain't no eril - you're a prince!

792
01:10:11,657 --> 01:10:13,115
Aw, phsaw!

793
01:10:24,990 --> 01:10:27,782
I wonder whether he will
have an American accent.

794
01:10:27,865 --> 01:10:32,282
My dear, won't it be interesting if he
has the Dorincourt eyebrows? - Ha, ha, ha!

795
01:10:32,365 --> 01:10:37,157
When do we see the mother? - I believe she's
supposed to be kept in the background.

796
01:10:42,365 --> 01:10:46,532
Well, Molyneux, is this the boy?
- Yes, Constantia, this is the boy.

797
01:10:46,657 --> 01:10:49,532
Fauntleroy, this is your great-aunt,
Lady Lorridale.

798
01:10:49,615 --> 01:10:53,907
How do you do. Great-Aunt? - How d'ye
do young man? You're like your father.

799
01:10:54,573 --> 01:10:57,407
I loved him more than most
people in this wicked world.

800
01:10:57,532 --> 01:11:01,032
Did you know my father?
- Know him? Of course I did.

801
01:11:01,240 --> 01:11:05,490
Oh, then you must meet Dearest! She will
enormously like to talk to you about him.

802
01:11:06,657 --> 01:11:10,240
You see, I was the only one she could
talk about him to, who knew him.

803
01:11:10,657 --> 01:11:12,323
I was so small when he...

804
01:11:12,407 --> 01:11:15,782
Yes, Fauntleroy, this is your
great-uncle, Sir Harry Lorridale.

805
01:11:15,865 --> 01:11:18,532
How do you do, sir?
- Hear, you're fond of horses.

806
01:11:18,657 --> 01:11:23,032
I'll confess to you, Constantia, that
what you will probably see for yourself

807
01:11:23,573 --> 01:11:27,657
there's a risk of my becoming rather
an old fool about him. - Becoming?

808
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:32,615
Ha, ha, ha! - By the way the mother,
what does she think of you?

809
01:11:32,698 --> 01:11:34,698
I don't know. I haven't asked her.

810
01:11:35,073 --> 01:11:38,157
You must come over to
Lorridale Park to see us.

811
01:11:38,407 --> 01:11:42,323
There are some new cocker puppies in the
kennel. You shall have your pick.

812
01:11:42,615 --> 01:11:47,032
Oh, thank you very much, indeed, uncle,
only, Dougal might be offended.

813
01:11:47,490 --> 01:11:51,948
He's very fond of me and I really shouldn't
like to hurt his feelings. - Ha, ha, ha.

814
01:11:52,490 --> 01:11:55,740
Hurt his feelings! That's a good one!
Did you hear that, Con?

815
01:11:55,823 --> 01:11:58,240
Hurt his feelings! Ha, ha, ha!

816
01:12:00,032 --> 01:12:03,907
This is Miss Herbert, Fauntleroy.
I want you to be great friends with her.

817
01:12:03,990 --> 01:12:08,573
How do you do? Have you met Dougal?
He shakes hands beautifully.

818
01:12:08,740 --> 01:12:10,615
Shake hands with Miss Herbert, Dougal.

819
01:12:13,115 --> 01:12:17,698
He's a great friend of mine. I like
making friends, don't you? - Yes, I do.

820
01:12:17,782 --> 01:12:22,115
May I be your friend? And Dougal's?
- Oh, yes, if you please!

821
01:12:22,907 --> 01:12:27,573
How's your lumbago, Fortescue?
Better, I hope? - Thanks. Much better.

822
01:12:28,698 --> 01:12:33,032
I've known Dorincourt as well as anyone
could know him for five and thirty years,

823
01:12:33,573 --> 01:12:37,448
and that's the first time he's ever
bothered to inquire about my health!

824
01:12:38,032 --> 01:12:39,657
Most extraordinary!

825
01:12:42,323 --> 01:12:44,365
Well, Havisham, you're late.
What's kept you?

826
01:12:44,448 --> 01:12:47,532
I beg your pardon, my lord. I was
detained by extraordinary news.

827
01:12:47,698 --> 01:12:52,282
News? What... what news? - Not now,
if you don't mind. Later, my lord, later.

828
01:13:03,198 --> 01:13:06,740
The young May moon is beaming, love

829
01:13:07,157 --> 01:13:10,865
The glowworm's lamp is gleaming, love

830
01:13:11,323 --> 01:13:15,573
How sweet to rove through Morna's Grove

831
01:13:15,782 --> 01:13:20,240
While the drowsy world is dreaming, love

832
01:13:21,032 --> 01:13:24,323
Then awake! Till rise of sun, my dear

833
01:13:24,490 --> 01:13:28,240
The Sage's glass we'll shun my dear

834
01:13:28,573 --> 01:13:33,157
Or in watching the flight
of bodies of light

835
01:13:33,323 --> 01:13:38,032
He might happen to take
thee for one, my dear

836
01:13:40,990 --> 01:13:44,032
Charming! Charming! What a sweet song!

837
01:13:44,282 --> 01:13:46,490
Thank ye, my dear, thank you.

838
01:13:48,740 --> 01:13:51,782
Do you like music?
- Yes. I like it when you sing it.

839
01:13:53,573 --> 01:13:58,157
Tell me, Lord Fauntleroy, why you look at
me so? - I was thinking how beautiful you are.

840
01:13:58,323 --> 01:14:02,865
Fauntleroy, make the most of your time. When you're
older, you'll not have the courage to say that!

841
01:14:02,948 --> 01:14:06,532
Nobody could help saying it.
Don't you think, she's pretty too?

842
01:14:06,740 --> 01:14:10,990
We're not allowed to say what we think.
- Lord Fauntleroy shall say what he thinks.

843
01:14:11,365 --> 01:14:13,365
I am sure he thinks what he says.

844
01:14:13,990 --> 01:14:17,490
I think you're prettier than anyone I ever
saw, expect Dearest.

845
01:14:17,823 --> 01:14:21,907
I think she's the prettiest person
on the world. - I'm sure she is.

846
01:14:22,448 --> 01:14:25,032
And I must tell her how kind you've been to me.

847
01:14:25,865 --> 01:14:30,407
I never was at a party before,
and I've enjoyed myself so much.

848
01:14:31,240 --> 01:14:33,365
Oh, I beg your pardon.

849
01:14:39,240 --> 01:14:42,615
Good night, little Lord
Fauntleroy. Sleep well.

850
01:14:53,323 --> 01:14:55,782
Good night. So glad you came.

851
01:15:04,157 --> 01:15:06,657
Well, Havisham,
what in the world's the matter?

852
01:15:06,740 --> 01:15:10,115
Something serious must have happened
to make you behave like this. What is it?

853
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:14,782
It's bad news, the very
worst of news, my lord.

854
01:15:16,073 --> 01:15:18,157
I'm sorry to have to be the bearer of it.

855
01:15:19,573 --> 01:15:23,115
Why do you look at the boy so? You
hang over him like a bird of ill omen.

856
01:15:27,282 --> 01:15:30,032
Has it anything to do with Fauntleroy?

857
01:15:30,407 --> 01:15:34,365
My lord, I'll waste no words. My news
has everything to do with him.

858
01:15:34,532 --> 01:15:38,032
If we are to believe it, it's not Lord
Fauntleroy who lies asleep before us,

859
01:15:38,115 --> 01:15:40,115
but only the son of Captain Errol.

860
01:15:40,698 --> 01:15:44,698
The present Lord Fauntleroy is the son
of your boy Bevis, and at this moment

861
01:15:44,782 --> 01:15:49,823
is in a lodging house in London.
- What do you mean? You're mad!

862
01:15:54,490 --> 01:15:55,490
It's a lie!

863
01:15:57,823 --> 01:15:59,282
An abominable lie!

864
01:15:59,573 --> 01:16:02,323
If it's a lie, it's painfully like the truth.

865
01:16:04,823 --> 01:16:08,532
A woman came to my chambers this morning
and told me that she married your son Bevis

866
01:16:08,615 --> 01:16:12,032
in London 11 years ago.
She showed me the marriage certificate.

867
01:16:12,448 --> 01:16:16,240
The child was born shortly after Bevis
deserted her and was taken by her to America.

868
01:16:16,323 --> 01:16:20,198
The woman's obviously an imposter!
It's a trumped-up fraud!

869
01:16:20,407 --> 01:16:23,323
I'm afraid not, my lord.
I saw the boy's birth certificate.

870
01:16:25,282 --> 01:16:27,573
She is, I'm afraid, a very ignorant person

871
01:16:27,657 --> 01:16:30,823
but she has consulted a lawyer who advises
her, that her son is, of course,

872
01:16:30,907 --> 01:16:32,865
Lord Fauntleroy and the rightful heir.

873
01:16:32,948 --> 01:16:35,407
She demands that his claim
be immediately acknowledged.

874
01:16:35,490 --> 01:16:39,657
I'll protest this to the last!
I'll disown Bevis' boy!

875
01:16:40,198 --> 01:16:43,865
I'll have nothing to do with him or his
mother! - You can't disown him, my lord.

876
01:16:44,240 --> 01:16:48,115
Nothing we can do can keep the eldest
son's child from his inheritance.

877
01:16:56,990 --> 01:17:01,990
The woman, you say is an
ignorant vulgar person, eh?

878
01:17:02,407 --> 01:17:07,698
She can hardly spell her own name. She is
obviously uneducated and openly mercenary.

879
01:17:10,948 --> 01:17:14,948
And I... I objected to his mother.

880
01:17:18,115 --> 01:17:19,907
I suppose it's retribution.

881
01:17:22,907 --> 01:17:25,740
If anyone have ever told me that I could
be fond of a child,

882
01:17:27,032 --> 01:17:28,657
I wouldn't have believed them.

883
01:17:30,115 --> 01:17:34,657
I always detested children -
my own more than most.

884
01:17:36,365 --> 01:17:42,990
But I'm fond of him, and oddly
enough - he's fond of me.

885
01:17:44,532 --> 01:17:48,865
You know, Havisham, I'm not
popular. I never was

886
01:17:50,573 --> 01:17:52,073
but he is fond of me.

887
01:17:53,865 --> 01:17:58,740
He never was afraid of me,
always trusted me.

888
01:18:01,740 --> 01:18:08,740
Yes, Havisham, he'd have filled my
place better than I've filled it.

889
01:18:10,865 --> 01:18:13,448
He'd have been an honor to the name.

890
01:18:17,198 --> 01:18:18,240
You rang, my lord?

891
01:18:20,532 --> 01:18:21,532
Take...

892
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:24,490
take Lord Fauntleroy

893
01:18:25,657 --> 01:18:26,657
to his room.

894
01:18:44,990 --> 01:18:48,573
What a pity! The boy's
thoroughbred if ever there was one.

895
01:18:48,657 --> 01:18:50,782
I suppose you may say it's a
judgment of Molyneux.

896
01:18:51,615 --> 01:18:52,615
That boy...

897
01:18:53,365 --> 01:18:55,407
the first human being he ever loved!

898
01:18:56,573 --> 01:18:59,032
Will Molyneux take the case
to the courts d'you think?

899
01:18:59,323 --> 01:19:01,073
Can't tell. He's obstinate enough.

900
01:19:01,448 --> 01:19:04,823
You go in with your best suit,
buckles on your shoes

901
01:19:05,407 --> 01:19:06,865
and you come out as nature made you

902
01:19:07,323 --> 01:19:11,657
Bless my soul, Constantia, whoever would
have dreamed that I'd felt sorry

903
01:19:11,740 --> 01:19:12,573
for the old boy!

904
01:19:12,657 --> 01:19:15,740
I wouldn't have minded our having
a boy like that, Harry.

905
01:19:16,032 --> 01:19:19,073
Yes, bit of luck for us,
old girl, if we had. - Yeah.

906
01:19:21,657 --> 01:19:25,323
I'll tell you one thing - if his
Little Lordship loses his title,

907
01:19:25,407 --> 01:19:27,407
the village loses the best friend it has.

908
01:19:27,490 --> 01:19:32,448
That's right. An' I'll tell you another thing -
it'll drive the earl mad if this goes wrong for him.

909
01:19:32,740 --> 01:19:35,698
He's been so proud of the boy,
you hardly believe it

910
01:19:35,782 --> 01:19:39,657
if you knew him for what he was before.
- And the new one's no lady, that's sure.

911
01:19:39,990 --> 01:19:41,948
Bold-faced thing, that's what she is.

912
01:19:42,448 --> 01:19:44,782
The dark-eyed brazen-faced wench!

913
01:19:45,573 --> 01:19:47,865
'Ere's the earl comin' now
with Mr. Havisham.

914
01:19:54,407 --> 01:19:57,407
You've somebody here calling herself
Lady Fauntleroy? I want to see her.

915
01:19:57,490 --> 01:19:59,865
Come the ways, my lord. This way, my lord.

916
01:20:04,948 --> 01:20:05,948
Come in.

917
01:20:11,740 --> 01:20:13,532
T' earl of Dorincourt!

918
01:20:22,073 --> 01:20:24,240
Pleased to meetcha, I'm sure, my lord.

919
01:20:31,240 --> 01:20:32,240
Bevis!

920
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,657
Go shake hands with your grandpa.

921
01:20:57,407 --> 01:20:59,615
So that's the way you're
gonna treat your grandson?

922
01:21:00,448 --> 01:21:03,532
You needn't try to look so fierce about
it - he's your grandson all right!

923
01:21:03,948 --> 01:21:07,240
Ah, yes, me lord, we have proof
of young gentleman's birth.

924
01:21:07,282 --> 01:21:09,282
He is the son of the late Lord Fauntleroy.

925
01:21:09,907 --> 01:21:14,532
Allow me to introduce myself.
Joshua Snade at your service. My card.

926
01:21:16,907 --> 01:21:19,948
I've already had the pleasure of making
Mr. Havisham's acquaintance.

927
01:21:21,115 --> 01:21:24,282
Lady Fauntleroy has placed
all the evidence in my hands.

928
01:21:24,698 --> 01:21:29,115
I can assure you, lord, it is sufficient
to justify her case should it come into court.

929
01:21:29,490 --> 01:21:33,198
But may I suggest that, uh,
we come to an arrangement

930
01:21:33,282 --> 01:21:36,490
and settle this matter amicably
on a friendly basis...

931
01:21:36,865 --> 01:21:38,073
Friendly? Huh!

932
01:21:38,698 --> 01:21:41,948
Look at him starin' as though I was
dirt! His own daughter-in-law!

933
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:46,115
Oh, your son Bevis married me,
all right and a fine rotter he was!

934
01:21:46,240 --> 01:21:49,198
But he was the father and I can
prove it! - Lady Fauntleroy, please...

935
01:21:49,282 --> 01:21:51,782
You may think you can fight me -
a lot of good it'll do!

936
01:21:52,073 --> 01:21:54,282
They don't love you - you know it!

937
01:21:54,365 --> 01:21:57,448
I've heard plenty about you
and your dirty, snobbish pride!

938
01:21:57,573 --> 01:21:59,698
Plenty of pride you'll have when
I'm finished with you!

939
01:22:00,198 --> 01:22:04,448
Unless you want to get reasonable
with your own flesh and blood.

940
01:22:04,490 --> 01:22:05,740
Lady Fauntleroy, I beg you...
- Shut up!

941
01:22:06,073 --> 01:22:09,657
I'll stop at nothing! I drag this case
through every court.

942
01:22:09,740 --> 01:22:13,823
I'll let the world know what you are -
you and your precious son Bevis!

943
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:17,490
Deserting me and his own
child - a babe in arms!

944
01:22:18,823 --> 01:22:21,365
How I've suffered,
heaven only knows!

945
01:22:21,448 --> 01:22:24,532
And you standin' and lookin' at me
and my boy as if we was scum!

946
01:22:24,823 --> 01:22:26,323
You ought to be ashamed of yourself!

947
01:22:27,073 --> 01:22:28,823
You say you married my eldest son.

948
01:22:29,573 --> 01:22:32,073
If that's proved to be true,
the law's on your side.

949
01:22:33,032 --> 01:22:38,615
In that case your son will be Lord
Fauntleroy. And you will be provided for.

950
01:22:39,032 --> 01:22:42,740
But I warn you - the matter
will be sifted to the very bottom.

951
01:22:44,782 --> 01:22:49,282
I'll only add that I want to see nothing
of you or your boy as long as I live.

952
01:22:50,448 --> 01:22:54,615
After my death, you can, unfortunately,
do as you please.

953
01:22:57,573 --> 01:23:03,823
Yes, you're exactly the kind of person that I
should have expected my son Bevis to choose.

954
01:23:09,032 --> 01:23:11,740
Ha, ha, ha!

955
01:23:14,782 --> 01:23:17,365
I'm afraid, Dorincourt,
there can be no two opinions.

956
01:23:17,740 --> 01:23:20,907
At least, that's how I see it.
You agree, Semple?

957
01:23:20,990 --> 01:23:25,740
Yes, I'm afraid we can see it no
other way. - But it's... it's monstrous!

958
01:23:26,740 --> 01:23:31,073
That woman...
that boy are utterly unfit!

959
01:23:31,240 --> 01:23:33,990
Alas, the law can take
no cognizance of such things.

960
01:23:34,407 --> 01:23:38,407
I sympathize, Dorincourt, more than I can
say. - Sympathize! What's the use of that?

961
01:23:38,490 --> 01:23:43,448
If we take it to the courts there can
be only one result? - I'm afraid so.

962
01:23:43,740 --> 01:23:46,448
The birth certificate, everything
we have, point the same way.

963
01:23:46,532 --> 01:23:49,657
If you take it to court, you'll have
the expense and notoriety,

964
01:23:49,740 --> 01:23:52,407
and only, I fear, one possible result.

965
01:23:53,073 --> 01:23:55,990
Perhaps the boy won't turn
out so badly as you fear.

966
01:23:56,240 --> 01:23:58,990
Perhaps you can do something
with him. - That boy?

967
01:23:59,073 --> 01:24:00,740
That... oaf!

968
01:24:07,198 --> 01:24:10,865
With the other one - yes.

969
01:24:13,823 --> 01:24:14,823
Well...

970
01:24:15,282 --> 01:24:18,990
I have no other course but
to accept your judgment.

971
01:24:21,073 --> 01:24:23,490
Come, Havisham. - Thank you, my lord.
- And you, Mr. Semple.

972
01:24:33,115 --> 01:24:35,990
It's the earl, ma'am. The earl himself!

973
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,240
Show him in.

974
01:24:58,282 --> 01:25:01,490
Mrs. Errol, I believe.
- Yes, I'm Mrs. Errol.

975
01:25:02,240 --> 01:25:03,698
I'm Lord Dorincourt.

976
01:25:06,323 --> 01:25:07,532
The boy is very like you.

977
01:25:08,407 --> 01:25:09,907
People have often said so.

978
01:25:10,490 --> 01:25:15,490
I'm glad to think he's like his
father too. - Yes, he is - like my son.

979
01:25:17,448 --> 01:25:19,115
Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

980
01:25:26,907 --> 01:25:31,282
I've come to tell you that I've had the
very best, the highest legal opinion.

981
01:25:32,490 --> 01:25:37,157
But I'm sorry. This outrageous
woman and her child...

982
01:25:37,240 --> 01:25:41,115
Perhaps she cares for him as much as
I care for Ceddie, my lord.

983
01:25:41,198 --> 01:25:43,948
Her son is Lord Fauntleroy - mine's not.

984
01:25:45,073 --> 01:25:47,323
Yes, I'm afraid you're right.

985
01:25:48,865 --> 01:25:52,282
Perhaps you would have preferred that
Ceddie should not be the earl of Dorincourt.

986
01:25:54,157 --> 01:25:58,490
It's a very magnificent thing to be
the earl of Dorincourt, my lord. I know that.

987
01:25:59,323 --> 01:26:02,740
But all I care about is that Ceddie
should be what his father was -

988
01:26:03,198 --> 01:26:06,573
brave, just and kind always.

989
01:26:07,115 --> 01:26:11,407
Hmm, a striking contrast
to what his grandfather is, eh?

990
01:26:11,907 --> 01:26:14,490
I haven't had the pleasure
of knowing his grandfather.

991
01:26:15,365 --> 01:26:17,448
I know my little boy believes...

992
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,198
I know that Ceddie loves you.

993
01:26:22,240 --> 01:26:25,782
Would he, if you have told him why
I didn't receive you at the castle?

994
01:26:26,865 --> 01:26:31,365
No, honestly, I think not. That's
why I didn't wish him to know.

995
01:26:33,698 --> 01:26:38,073
Well... there are very few women
who wouldn't have told him.

996
01:26:42,573 --> 01:26:45,865
Dearest, Ceddie is fond of me.

997
01:26:48,448 --> 01:26:49,448
And I am fond of him.

998
01:26:52,282 --> 01:26:53,365
I can't say

999
01:26:54,907 --> 01:26:57,032
that I was ever fond of anyone before.

1000
01:26:58,740 --> 01:27:01,240
But he pleased me from the first.

1001
01:27:02,573 --> 01:27:05,365
I'm an old man and
I was tired of my life.

1002
01:27:06,490 --> 01:27:08,657
But he's given me something to live for.

1003
01:27:09,907 --> 01:27:14,948
More than that - more than
that, I am proud of him!

1004
01:27:16,948 --> 01:27:19,157
I was satisfied to think that one day

1005
01:27:20,157 --> 01:27:24,573
he'd be taking my place
as the head of the family.

1006
01:27:28,323 --> 01:27:29,907
I'm miserable...

1007
01:27:32,490 --> 01:27:33,490
miserable!

1008
01:27:43,115 --> 01:27:46,948
Please, sit down. You've been so
much troubled, you must be tired

1009
01:27:47,573 --> 01:27:48,948
and you need all your strength.

1010
01:27:50,573 --> 01:27:51,573
Thank you.

1011
01:27:58,573 --> 01:28:02,240
Perhaps it's because I'm
miserable, I've come to you.

1012
01:28:04,073 --> 01:28:05,240
I used to hate you.

1013
01:28:06,907 --> 01:28:08,198
I've been jealous to you.

1014
01:28:08,865 --> 01:28:12,323
But this wretched disgraceful
business has changed all that.

1015
01:28:13,157 --> 01:28:15,990
And after seeing this repulsive woman who...

1016
01:28:17,407 --> 01:28:20,115
Well, I felt it would be
a relief to come to you.

1017
01:28:24,615 --> 01:28:27,573
I'm an obstinate old fool, I suppose.

1018
01:28:31,865 --> 01:28:34,282
I... I know I've treated you badly.

1019
01:28:36,532 --> 01:28:39,282
But I've come to you
because the boy cares for you

1020
01:28:41,282 --> 01:28:43,115
and because I care for him.

1021
01:28:48,698 --> 01:28:49,948
Treat me as well as you can

1022
01:28:51,907 --> 01:28:52,907
for the boy's sake.

1023
01:29:05,365 --> 01:29:07,698
Whatever happens,
he shall be provided for.

1024
01:29:08,615 --> 01:29:11,990
Ceddie shall be taken care
of now, and in the future.

1025
01:29:13,323 --> 01:29:14,490
Always!
- Thank you.

1026
01:29:16,448 --> 01:29:17,448
Do you like the house?

1027
01:29:18,948 --> 01:29:20,032
Oh, very much.

1028
01:29:20,948 --> 01:29:22,157
It's a cheerful room.

1029
01:29:26,823 --> 01:29:30,948
May I come back again and
talk this matter over?

1030
01:29:32,157 --> 01:29:33,573
As often as you wish.

1031
01:29:55,823 --> 01:30:00,657
You've heard bad news, haven't you?
- Yes. The worst.

1032
01:30:02,323 --> 01:30:06,323
Then I'm not Lord Fauntleroy
anymore, am I?

1033
01:30:08,115 --> 01:30:09,365
No, she's beaten me.

1034
01:30:11,532 --> 01:30:12,907
Then, the other boy...

1035
01:30:13,698 --> 01:30:15,657
he will... have to be...

1036
01:30:16,198 --> 01:30:19,573
your boy now, won't he? Like I was?
- No!

1037
01:30:20,573 --> 01:30:23,782
But he'll have to live in the castle
if he's Lord Fauntleroy, won't he?

1038
01:30:23,865 --> 01:30:26,907
That common little brat shall never
enter this place in my lifetime!

1039
01:30:27,157 --> 01:30:28,157
I'll take care of that!

1040
01:30:29,157 --> 01:30:33,615
Then, I can still be your boy
even if I'm not going to be the earl

1041
01:30:34,490 --> 01:30:36,032
just like I was before?

1042
01:30:36,990 --> 01:30:37,990
My boy!

1043
01:30:39,115 --> 01:30:42,198
Yes, you'll be my boy as long as I live.

1044
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:49,073
And, by Jove, sometimes I think you're
the only boy I've ever had!

1045
01:30:49,657 --> 01:30:52,948
Then, I don't care about
the earl part at all.

1046
01:30:54,198 --> 01:31:00,657
I thought, you see, that the one that was
going to be the earl had to be your boy

1047
01:31:01,532 --> 01:31:03,198
and that I couldn't be.

1048
01:31:04,365 --> 01:31:07,073
They shall never take anything from you
that I can hold for you.

1049
01:31:07,865 --> 01:31:12,240
Come what may, you shall have
all that I can give - all!

1050
01:31:12,782 --> 01:31:16,990
And Dearest? Will the house
be taken away from her?

1051
01:31:17,073 --> 01:31:19,907
No, they can take nothing from her -

1052
01:31:21,115 --> 01:31:22,823
nothing from either of you!

1053
01:31:26,490 --> 01:31:29,615
Come, it's time you were asleep.

1054
01:32:01,782 --> 01:32:05,448
Good night, Grandfather.
- . Good night, my boy.

1055
01:32:14,823 --> 01:32:17,407
the aged earl remains
secluded in his castle

1056
01:32:17,990 --> 01:32:21,532
and refuses to have any communication
with the rightful heir.

1057
01:32:21,865 --> 01:32:24,615
We know dat stuff. Dey've been
printing 'dat for de past week

1058
01:32:24,990 --> 01:32:26,323
Is dere anyt'ing new about Ceddie?

1059
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,032
Yes! Here it says.

1060
01:32:29,823 --> 01:32:34,865
The prospects do not look very bright for the
false claimant, Cedric Errol of Brooklyn.

1061
01:32:36,407 --> 01:32:37,490
Well, I'm jiggered.

1062
01:32:41,865 --> 01:32:44,948
At last they've succeeded in robbin'
him outta bein' a earl.

1063
01:32:45,532 --> 01:32:48,407
I thought you was ag'inst erils?
- So I am!

1064
01:32:49,407 --> 01:32:53,573
Ain't it just like 'em - cheatin'
the poor kid outta his rightful estates!

1065
01:32:54,365 --> 01:32:56,115
Now, what's goin' to become of him?

1066
01:32:56,198 --> 01:32:58,948
I know one thing. He done everyt'ing for
me - he can always come back

1067
01:32:59,032 --> 01:33:00,823
an' have half of my shoe-shining business.

1068
01:33:01,698 --> 01:33:02,823
Well now, I'll tell you, Dick,

1069
01:33:04,198 --> 01:33:07,907
I'd always had it in my mind
that Ceddie would come in with me someday.

1070
01:33:08,990 --> 01:33:10,948
He'd be a shining light
in the grocery business.

1071
01:33:12,990 --> 01:33:17,073
The new Lady Fauntleroy
was formerly an actress.

1072
01:33:17,407 --> 01:33:23,115
She is said to have played in New York
and London. Continued in page 5.

1073
01:33:24,990 --> 01:33:26,157
Here's a picture of her.

1074
01:33:32,198 --> 01:33:34,115
Holy mackerel!
- What?

1075
01:33:34,198 --> 01:33:36,198
Look at this! it's her!
- Her?

1076
01:33:36,282 --> 01:33:40,573
She ain't no 'ristocrat! I know her as
I know you! It's Minna, Ben's wife!

1077
01:33:40,657 --> 01:33:43,490
Your brother's? - Sure!
- You mean it's some hocus-pocus?

1078
01:33:43,615 --> 01:33:45,657
Sure I do.
- Well, I'm jiggered.

1079
01:33:46,073 --> 01:33:49,448
She was married before - I never hoid of
her havin' no other kid but Ben's.

1080
01:33:49,657 --> 01:33:52,490
The one Ben went to look for?
- Sure.

1081
01:33:52,573 --> 01:33:56,282
Maybe she had another kid in England.
- Maybe she did - maybe she didn't.

1082
01:33:56,365 --> 01:33:58,907
We'd oughta do somethin' about it.
- You're dead right, we'd oughta!

1083
01:33:58,990 --> 01:34:02,740
But we gotta get the proper advice.
- Chee, I wisht I knew Alderman Moiphy.

1084
01:34:04,198 --> 01:34:05,240
I know Alderman Moiphy.

1085
01:34:06,490 --> 01:34:08,782
Ya do? - Yeah, come along,
let's go right now!

1086
01:34:09,323 --> 01:34:13,032
Them earls! They've always had a spite
against us Americans ever since the revolution!

1087
01:34:17,282 --> 01:34:22,448
What a place! What a hole!
I'm sick to death of it!

1088
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:27,448
Cooped up here week in and week out
with nobody to talk to!

1089
01:34:27,532 --> 01:34:30,032
You're complimentary!
- I wasn't meaning to be! - I'm grateful.

1090
01:34:30,115 --> 01:34:33,282
You're getting your money, aren't you?
- Business is business, you know.

1091
01:34:33,365 --> 01:34:38,073
Business! I'm sick of business! I want
some fun! - Why don't you go to London?

1092
01:34:38,323 --> 01:34:41,032
London? Not on your tintype!

1093
01:34:41,240 --> 01:34:44,865
Nothing would please that old devil at
the castle better than to see me clear out.

1094
01:34:45,407 --> 01:34:48,907
Well, I'll stay here... here in this
rotten country pub if I...

1095
01:34:48,990 --> 01:34:53,240
You've lived in worse places, I've no
doubt! - That's none of your business!

1096
01:34:53,948 --> 01:34:57,532
You keep a civil tongue or I'll hand you
your walking papers! - I wouldn't.

1097
01:34:58,615 --> 01:35:04,532
What do you mean? - Just what I said.
I wouldn't try anything like that, Minna.

1098
01:35:06,157 --> 01:35:08,990
I'm Lady Fauntleroy, to you!
- Ha, ha.

1099
01:35:11,282 --> 01:35:12,282
Come in!

1100
01:35:15,573 --> 01:35:17,490
Why, it's Lord Dorincourt!

1101
01:35:18,282 --> 01:35:22,823
Why, this is a pleasure, a real
pleasure, I'm sure. Won't you take a...

1102
01:35:24,907 --> 01:35:25,907
Hello, Minna.

1103
01:35:27,282 --> 01:35:28,490
Why, hello, Dick.

1104
01:35:37,657 --> 01:35:40,740
Why, Ben. What are you doing here?

1105
01:35:41,448 --> 01:35:42,907
Where have you been all this time?

1106
01:35:43,907 --> 01:35:48,948
You knew her? - Funny, if he didn't...
seein' how he was my second husband.

1107
01:35:49,032 --> 01:35:52,990
Where is the child? - What child?
- You know, our boy, Tom.

1108
01:35:53,073 --> 01:35:57,615
Oh, Ben, but you know...
You must have heard...

1109
01:35:58,073 --> 01:36:00,948
Someone must have told you.
- Told me what?

1110
01:36:01,657 --> 01:36:07,490
It was pneumonia. Only three days
and he was gone. It broke my heart.

1111
01:36:08,073 --> 01:36:10,448
I meant to write.
I didn't know where you were.

1112
01:36:10,698 --> 01:36:13,698
If that's true, who is this
boy you've got with you?

1113
01:36:13,782 --> 01:36:15,282
That's none of your business, Ben Tipton!

1114
01:36:16,698 --> 01:36:21,490
Can I see him? - You can't! - Tell us why
Mr. Tipton should not see your boy?

1115
01:36:23,323 --> 01:36:25,032
Oh, hello, Uncle Dick.

1116
01:36:26,823 --> 01:36:27,907
Well, I'll be jiggered!

1117
01:36:29,198 --> 01:36:31,115
Mom, honest, I'm sorry...
- Shut up!

1118
01:36:31,282 --> 01:36:35,198
You're a dirty pair, comin' to spy on me!
Tryin' to do me hurt!

1119
01:36:35,448 --> 01:36:38,698
I'll have the law on ya
for houndin' me, you... you... you...

1120
01:36:38,782 --> 01:36:39,782
Silence!

1121
01:36:42,032 --> 01:36:43,032
Come here, Tom.

1122
01:36:51,073 --> 01:36:53,323
I knew nothing, my lord, I assure you!

1123
01:36:53,407 --> 01:36:57,865
There's a little matter of a forged birth
certificate. - But I swear to you!

1124
01:36:57,948 --> 01:37:00,948
Never mind, Havisham.
I've had enough of this - too much!

1125
01:37:01,198 --> 01:37:03,573
The sooner you are out
of this country, the better!

1126
01:37:03,740 --> 01:37:07,865
Come on, Havisham. - You'll be sorry - you will!
It's prosecution, that's what it is - it's robbery!

1127
01:37:15,823 --> 01:37:22,573
The Earl of Dorincourt and Ceddie requests
the pleasure of Mr. Silas Hobbs company

1128
01:37:22,657 --> 01:37:27,073
on the eleventh of May at
8 p.m. At Dorincourt Castle

1129
01:37:27,157 --> 01:37:32,907
of the occasion of the tenth birthday
of his grandson Lord Fauntleroy.

1130
01:37:39,282 --> 01:37:41,782
This will be somewhat in the manner
of a museum, my lord?

1131
01:37:41,865 --> 01:37:46,282
Not exactly a museum, Mr. Hobbs.
They are portraits of my ancestors.

1132
01:37:47,532 --> 01:37:50,157
Your aunt's sisters! All of them?

1133
01:37:50,823 --> 01:37:55,615
Well, I'll be jiggered! Your great-uncle,
he must have had a family!

1134
01:37:56,282 --> 01:37:57,490
Did he raise 'em all?

1135
01:37:57,573 --> 01:38:01,198
Ah, you mean that they were early
distinguished members of the family.

1136
01:38:02,573 --> 01:38:06,740
Do you know, earl, I used to have a very
poor opinion of your aristocracy,

1137
01:38:07,448 --> 01:38:12,657
but I've changed. Take you, for instance,
you're a good sort, even if you are an earl!

1138
01:38:12,740 --> 01:38:13,823
I'm very gratified.

1139
01:38:18,490 --> 01:38:22,865
A bit gay, wasn't he? - Yes, that's why
I have the gout, Mr. Hobbs.

1140
01:38:24,323 --> 01:38:25,323
Oh!

1141
01:38:28,032 --> 01:38:33,573
And they was all earls! And Ceddie's
goin' to be one and own all this!

1142
01:38:33,657 --> 01:38:37,323
And he'll be worthy of it, Mr. Hobbs.
- Sure he will.

1143
01:38:38,948 --> 01:38:40,365
All these earls!

1144
01:38:41,865 --> 01:38:45,532
Do you know, I wouldn't have
minded bein' one myself! - Hmm!

1145
01:38:47,615 --> 01:38:50,115
Speech! Speech! Speech!

1146
01:38:51,448 --> 01:38:52,782
Speech! Speech!

1147
01:38:55,115 --> 01:38:56,240
Thank you very much.

1148
01:38:56,990 --> 01:39:02,823
It's such a lovely day. I always like having
birthdays, but never one so much as this,

1149
01:39:02,907 --> 01:39:04,448
because you're all so kind to me.

1150
01:39:05,740 --> 01:39:08,657
My grandfather wants everybody to be
happy and comfortable

1151
01:39:08,782 --> 01:39:10,907
and I'll want it too when I'm grown up.

1152
01:39:13,240 --> 01:39:17,198
I think that's all, because I'm not very
good of making speeches.

1153
01:39:18,157 --> 01:39:22,282
But I must say that I'm very much obliged
to you for liking my birthday.

1154
01:39:26,657 --> 01:39:29,198
Ripping little nipper!
- Ain't he a daisy?

1155
01:39:29,615 --> 01:39:31,615
I'll bet you boids elect him king some day!

1156
01:39:34,615 --> 01:39:36,698
I didn't know the little feller
could talk so good.

1157
01:39:36,990 --> 01:39:40,157
He makes a better speech than
Alderman Murphy - by Jove.

1158
01:39:40,407 --> 01:39:42,573
Ugh, well, I'll be jiggered!

1159
01:39:44,157 --> 01:39:46,115
And I've another birthday present for you.

1160
01:39:46,240 --> 01:39:50,698
Another one, besides all the things this
morning? - Yes, the best of them all.

1161
01:39:53,615 --> 01:39:55,032
Oh, Dearest!

1162
01:39:55,865 --> 01:39:57,323
Oh, Dearest!

1163
01:40:01,782 --> 01:40:05,407
Oh, Dearest, I was wanting you here!
I was wanting you here so terribly much!

1164
01:40:05,490 --> 01:40:06,490
Were you, darling?

1165
01:40:08,115 --> 01:40:10,948
Fauntleroy, your mother has
come to live in the castle.

1166
01:40:11,073 --> 01:40:14,865
To live with us, to live with us for always?
- Are you sure you really want me?

1167
01:40:14,948 --> 01:40:18,323
We always wanted you, but we
weren't exactly aware of it.

1168
01:40:20,282 --> 01:40:23,823
Well, Mr. Hobbs, it's so nice
having you here with us.

1169
01:40:24,115 --> 01:40:26,365
I dread to think of you
going back to America.

1170
01:40:26,782 --> 01:40:28,865
Not to live there!

1171
01:40:29,323 --> 01:40:32,240
America's a good enough country for
them that's young and stirrin',

1172
01:40:32,615 --> 01:40:37,740
but there's faults in it! There's not an
aunt's sister among 'em, nor an earl!
