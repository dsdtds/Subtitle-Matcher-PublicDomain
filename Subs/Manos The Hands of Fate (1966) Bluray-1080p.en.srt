2
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:56,300
We’re almost there, honey. Just a little
while longer and your vacation starts.

3
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:59,600
I’m getting cold, mother, and hungry.

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,500
We should be pretty close right now,

5
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,900
the agent said it was about
12 miles from highway 10,

6
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,900
and that was highway 10, back there.

7
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,700
But you know we should’ve asked for
better directions at the last gas station.

8
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,200
Listen, I’ve never gotten us lost before.

9
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,400
Mommy, I’m cold.

10
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,200
Okay, Debbie, I’ll put the top up.

11
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,000
Never mind, Mike.
Debbie can come up and sit between us.

12
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,700
Now, that’s better, baby.

13
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,800
Why don’t we sing a song
to help pass the time?

14
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:57,400
<i>Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream</i>

15
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:02,100
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream</i>

16
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:06,900
<i>Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream</i>

17
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,600
<i>Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily,
life is but a dream</i>

18
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:14,100
<i>Row, row, row your boat</i>

19
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,700
All right, mister.
I see you have a tail light problem.

20
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:03,900
No excuse – running late,
first vacation, kid getting tired.

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,200
It’s too bad.

22
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:07,400
Well, can’t you give us a break, officer?

23
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:11,500
Well, all right, all right.

24
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:14,300
Sure do appreciate it.
We are running kind of late.

25
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,100
Okay, but if you’re running late,
you should’ve started earlier.

26
00:03:18,200 --> 00:03:22,000
Anyhow, no tail light.
Have it fixed.

27
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,600
Thank you, officer.

28
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Ten miles up this road.

29
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:19,100
We’re almost there, Debbie.
Just a few minutes more.

30
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,200
- I wonder where they’re going.
- Man, like, there’s nothing up that road.

31
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,600
Now look, the sign pointed this way.

32
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:16,700
Mike, let’s go back to the crossroads
and ask those kids we saw.

33
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,500
Okay, okay,
but I know we can’t be wrong.

34
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,700
Look, the sign pointed this way.

35
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:18,000
How many times do we have
to chase you kids?

36
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,300
Oh, shit.

37
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,900
Holy cow, man.

38
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:24,200
You think we’re doing
something wrong.

39
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,400
Well, whatever it is you’re not doing,
go don’t do it somewhere else.

40
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:37,000
Why don’t you guys leave us alone?

41
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:43,000
Come on, now. No wisecracks.
Just go on home.

42
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:44,600
Okay.

43
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,100
- Get going, get going.
- All right already.

44
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,600
I could have sworn
we didn’t make a wrong turn.

45
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,600
You must have.

46
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,300
- Where did the road go?
- No need to get upset. We’ll find it.

47
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,500
Where did this place come from?
It wasn’t here a few minutes ago.

48
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,800
I don’t care. Let’s see
if we can get some directions.

49
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:11,300
Look, there’s someone at the door.

50
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,100
I am Torgo. I take care of the place
while the Master is away.

51
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:36,200
But the child – I’m not sure
the Master would approve, or the dog.

52
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,900
The Master doesn’t like children.

53
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,300
We only want to know
where Valley Lodge is.

54
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:43,200
Which way do we go?

55
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,400
There’s no place like that around here.

56
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:57,600
Mike, I’m scared.

57
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,000
It’s getting dark.

58
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:02,200
Well, Torgo, which way is out of here?

59
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:10,400
There is no way out of here.
It will be dark soon.

60
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,900
There is no way out of here.

61
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,500
No way out?

62
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,400
Well, you know, we could spend
the night here, and then tomorrow...

63
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:20,300
Oh, Mike, Mike...

64
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:23,200
I-I don’t want to spend the night here,
I don’t like the looks of the place.

65
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:25,000
Well, it seems we have no alternative.

66
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:27,800
Well, how about it, Torgo,
can we spend the night here?

67
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:33,100
Well, I don’t know what else we can do.

68
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,900
But Mike, I don’t wanna stay here.

69
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,000
And the Master wouldn’t approve.

70
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:43,400
Don’t worry about it, we’re here now,
and I’m sure the Master won’t throw us out.

71
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,900
Well? How about it, Torgo?

72
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,400
I don’t wanna stay!
Let’s leave!

73
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:53,700
I don’t know about it.
I just don’t know.

74
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:30,200
Daddy, I’m cold. Let’s go in.

75
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,800
Well, Torgo, in or out?

76
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,400
Patient, dear.

77
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,200
Very well.
The Master will be very disturbed.

78
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,700
I’ll get the luggage.

79
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,300
Torgo, we’ll stay tonight,
and then tomorrow...

80
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,000
You must be...
You cannot stay.

81
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:10,700
The Master would not approve.

82
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,800
See? You’re feeling better already.

83
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,500
Look at this.

84
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,800
Mike, I...

85
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,200
He looks so sinister.

86
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,100
Must be the Master himself.

87
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:54,200
Oh, Mike, I’m scared.

88
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,700
He has the meanest look.

89
00:14:56,800 --> 00:14:58,300
And that dog...

90
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:02,200
I’d hate to run up on him in the dark,
or even in the light, for that matter.

91
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:37,100
That must be your Master.
What did you say he was?

92
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:41,000
He has left this world,
but he is with us always –

93
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,500
no matter where we go,
he is with us.

94
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:49,100
- What?
- No matter where he goes?

95
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:50,800
What does that mean?

96
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,900
And that dog... is the most
vicious-looking animal I’ve ever seen.

97
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,300
Well, I hope he goes
where the Master goes.

98
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,900
There is nothing to fear, madam.

99
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
The Master likes you.

100
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:05,400
Nothing will happen to you;
he likes you.

101
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,900
Likes me?

102
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,800
I thought you said he was dead.

103
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:15,800
Dead? No, madam,
not “dead” the way you know it.

104
00:16:15,900 --> 00:16:18,000
He is with us always.

105
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,100
Not “dead” the way you know it.

106
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,600
He is with us always.

107
00:16:27,900 --> 00:16:29,800
Mike, I don’t like this.

108
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,300
Nothing to worry about,
it’s only your imagination.

109
00:16:47,900 --> 00:16:52,400
I think that it’s best
that I show you to the bedroom, now.

110
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,800
Oh, my God!
Mike, what was that?

111
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:06,100
Probably some animal in the desert.
Nothing to be afraid of.

112
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,700
I’m scared, Mike.

113
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:16,100
Michael, I don’t care what it is,
chase it away.

114
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:18,700
Okay, if it will make you relax,
I’ll go out and see what it is.

115
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,300
What happened? I heard...

116
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,900
Stay here. Get back into the house.

117
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:13,100
Get back in the house, damnit!

118
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,900
My God, Mike! What happened?

119
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:17,100
He’s dead. Peppie’s been killed.

120
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,500
Get back in the house, honey.

121
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,200
Mike, what kind of place is this?

122
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:25,000
My God, what kind of place is this?

123
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,900
I’ll take care of everything, honey.
Get back in the house.

124
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:00,800
Mike...

125
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,000
Oh, Mike, what could’ve done it?

126
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:09,900
Honey, it was probably
some animal from the desert.

127
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,400
This place must be full of them.

128
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:16,100
Peppie...

129
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:20,100
He went away, baby.
Went away while you were asleep.

130
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:25,700
Mike, I wanna leave this place.
Now.

131
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,800
Okay, honey. We’ll leave right away.

132
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,700
Where the hell is that caretaker?

133
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,000
Torgo!

134
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,800
Torgo!

135
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:46,600
Did you want me?

136
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:49,400
We’re leaving. Would you mind
putting the luggage back into the car?

137
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,800
As you wish.

138
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,600
Right now.

139
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:57,500
Fast, damnit! Fast!

140
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:53,100
I’ll be glad to leave,
I’ve had all this place I want.

141
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,100
Madam, it would be very dangerous
to leave now.

142
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:58,100
The Master wants you.

143
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
Wants me?

144
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:02,600
What kind of talk is that?

145
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,500
He wants you for his wife.

146
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,700
He loves beautiful women.

147
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,500
Don’t you ever try that again,
you... beast!

148
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:00,100
The Master wants you,
but he can’t have you.

149
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,300
I want you!

150
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,900
Stop that talk this instance, you hear?

151
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:06,900
He wants you,
but he can’t have you.

152
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:10,800
Mike! Mike!

153
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:36,100
Where in the world can he be?

154
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,100
Mike! Mike!

155
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:46,400
Let me out of here.

156
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,500
Let me out of here, now!

157
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,200
Do you hear? Now!

158
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,600
Forgive me, madam.

159
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:01,200
I meant no harm.

160
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:06,300
Forgive you?
Just wait till I tell my husband!

161
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:13,300
I meant no harm, madam.
I’ll protect you.

162
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:15,800
I will protect you.

163
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:22,100
Very well, I won’t tell my husband.

164
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:24,000
Now let me out.

165
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,200
Imagine, the damned car won’t start.

166
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:35,600
Margaret?

167
00:23:37,700 --> 00:23:39,400
Damned car won’t start.

168
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,800
Well, that really fixes things.
What are we gonna do now?

169
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,400
I don’t know, and I couldn’t find
anything wrong with it, either.

170
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:47,000
Hey, Torgo, where’s the phone?

171
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:52,700
Yes, Alexander Graham Bell,
you know, telephone?

172
00:23:54,700 --> 00:24:01,200
There is none, sir. The Master
doesn’t approve of such devices.

173
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,900
Then where is the nearest phone?

174
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:07,900
The nearest phone is at the crossroads.

175
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,400
That’s ten miles.

176
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:13,300
Ten miles?
Might as well be 10,000 miles!

177
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:15,500
Easy, honey. It won’t help to get mad.

178
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,900
The Master won’t mind
you staying tonight.

179
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:23,700
He has no choice – we can’t leave,
we can’t walk out of here,

180
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:25,700
and the damned car won’t start.

181
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,500
I’ll just bring the bags
back to the room.

182
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:38,700
Sinister.

183
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:41,100
“Sinister” isn’t descriptive enough.

184
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,500
Honey, we’ll leave in the morning,
and soon this place will be forgotten.

185
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:48,000
Forgotten? I’ll never forget.

186
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:50,100
Peppie’s gone.

187
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:52,200
I just hope Debbie will understand.

188
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:55,700
She’ll understand.
She’s my baby, she’ll understand.

189
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:58,200
I hope so, darling. I sure hope so.

190
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,100
She’s my baby, she’ll understand.

191
00:25:03,500 --> 00:25:04,700
Say, where is she?

192
00:25:06,200 --> 00:25:08,300
Oh, my God! Michael!

193
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:12,400
Don’t get wrought up,
she’s probably playing hide-and-seek.

194
00:25:12,500 --> 00:25:14,800
Okay, Debbie, we see you.
Come out, come out, wherever you are.

195
00:25:14,900 --> 00:25:17,500
Maybe she slipped into one of the rooms.

196
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:18,700
Debbie?

197
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,900
- Debbie?
- Debbie?

198
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,300
Debbie?

199
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,900
Torgo, have you seen Debbie?

200
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,700
- No.
- She’s gone. Help us find her.

201
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:36,600
She couldn’t have gone outside;
the door is bolted.

202
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:40,000
For God’s sake, don’t panic!
She’s got to be in here.

203
00:25:41,900 --> 00:25:43,700
Is there another exit to the outside?

204
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:47,200
In the kitchen.

205
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,000
That door is bolted, too!

206
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:57,200
Outside, Mike.
She’s got to be outside.

207
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,400
All right, we’ll look outside for her.

208
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:03,100
- Debbie?
- Debbie?

209
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:05,600
- Debbie?
- Debbie?

210
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,800
Mike, I’m scared.

211
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,300
- The animals and Debbie...
- Cut it out!

212
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:28,400
We’ll find her. Don’t worry.

213
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:38,200
Debbie?

214
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,500
Debbie?

215
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:52,600
Daddy, is this a good puppy?

216
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:02,000
Mike, it’s the dog from the portrait.

217
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,500
Stand back, Debbie! Stand back!

218
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,600
That dog wants to play with you, daddy.

219
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:15,500
Darling, baby, you could’ve been hurt.

220
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:21,500
I saw the puppy and got close to.

221
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:27,000
But you should never run away from us.

222
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:30,000
Debbie, don’t ever run away from us.

223
00:27:30,100 --> 00:27:32,000
But I wanna find my puppy.

224
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:33,700
Where did you find the new dog, baby?

225
00:27:33,800 --> 00:27:35,300
In that big place.

226
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:37,600
In a big place? Where, Debbie?

227
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:40,400
There was this big dark place.

228
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:44,500
It was so dark,
but I wasn’t afraid of the dark,

229
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,000
there were all kinds
of funny people in it.

230
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:49,600
Where is the place, Debbie?

231
00:27:49,700 --> 00:27:51,200
Follow me, daddy.

232
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:12,200
Mike, it’s horrible!

233
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:14,100
- Let’s get out of here!
- Let’s go!

234
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,700
Get into the bedroom
and lock yourself in.

235
00:28:22,800 --> 00:28:24,800
I’m gonna find Torgo.
He’s got some explaining to do.

236
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:26,500
Hurry. Please hurry.

237
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:48,800
I want her.

238
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,100
She’s mine! Mine! Mine, you hear?

239
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,500
I want this one. You have all the wives
you need. This one is mine.

240
00:28:54,600 --> 00:28:55,800
Look!

241
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:11,800
Oh, you pretty ones.

242
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,900
No matter how good you are,

243
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:17,300
I won’t need you anymore.
I have my own wife!

244
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:19,900
I won’t have to come in here
to dream of having one of you.

245
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,900
You... You are the worst!

246
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,700
You were his first wife.

247
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,800
He doesn’t want you anymore.
And now even I don’t want you.

248
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:24,400
No, I’m through with all of you.

249
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:25,700
Through!

250
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,200
Through, you hear me?

251
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:27,900
Again? How many times
do you have to be told?

252
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,200
Like, wow!

253
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:35,000
Have a heart, will you?
Go chase that other couple.

254
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,300
What other couple?

255
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:44,400
Those idiots that went deeper in the desert.

256
00:35:44,500 --> 00:35:46,100
Find them and queue on them a while.

257
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,500
We know that this road goes nowhere,
so now get!

258
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,900
No smart stuff.

259
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,200
We ain’t trying to jump on you.

260
00:35:53,300 --> 00:35:54,500
Just get!

261
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:54,900
O Manos...

262
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:57,700
Thou of primal darkness!

263
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:02,600
Thou, who dwelleth in the depths of the
universe, in the black chasms of night!

264
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:34,200
Thou, who bestoweth the mother darkness
upon thy faithful,

265
00:37:34,300 --> 00:37:36,800
to live eternally in her keeping.

266
00:37:36,900 --> 00:37:40,200
Thou dost make him most blessed forever!

267
00:37:40,300 --> 00:37:43,400
And thou who dost curse
with eternal burning life

268
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:46,100
those who transgress
against thee!

269
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:50,400
Holy art thou, holy art thou,
holy art thou!

270
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,600
Manos will be done!

271
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:56,700
Thy priesthood remains steadfast,
thy priesthood remains constant,

272
00:37:56,800 --> 00:38:00,000
thy priesthood remains righteous.

273
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:03,300
Thou hast taught us, o Manos,
and we hath listened.

274
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,600
Give ear to our words, o Manos,
and hear us!

275
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:08,000
Hear us!

276
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,600
Hear us!

277
00:38:09,700 --> 00:38:13,000
For we are faithful
and thou art our God.

278
00:38:15,500 --> 00:38:18,000
Arise, my wives.

279
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,500
Give ear to the words of Manos.

280
00:38:21,700 --> 00:38:25,900
Arise, my wives,
and hear the will of Manos.

281
00:38:47,800 --> 00:38:50,400
Why has the child been brought here?

282
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,600
Why?

283
00:38:51,700 --> 00:38:53,500
And a female child at that!

284
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:09,700
I have never complained
about sacrificing a man,

285
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:10,700
but a child?

286
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,100
The woman is all we want.
The others must die.

287
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,100
They all must die!
We do not even want the woman.

288
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,200
They child is a female –
she must not be destroyed.

289
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,500
She will grow up to be a woman.

290
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:27,300
- She must be killed!
- No!

291
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:30,600
I’m the oldest of the wives,
and it is my privilege to say that...

292
00:39:30,700 --> 00:39:33,800
Enough!
Enough of this stupid bickering!

293
00:39:33,900 --> 00:39:35,500
The child must die!

294
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:41,100
If you persist in this foolishness,
your usefulness will come to an end.

295
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,200
Say what you will,
I will have no part of this madness.

296
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,600
As the oldest of the wives,
I demand that she lives.

297
00:39:49,700 --> 00:39:51,400
I don’t know what they’re doing here
in the first place.

298
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:53,400
You have caused enough trouble.

299
00:39:53,500 --> 00:39:56,800
I think perhaps your service to us
is at its end, now.

300
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:01,000
Silence! Silence!

301
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:09,100
And now, my wives, I shall deal with the one
who is responsible for the child being here.

302
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:13,100
Torgo, he’s the one!

303
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,700
Get Torgo!

304
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,800
You are responsible for this nonsense.

305
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,300
We shall dispose of you, later.

306
00:40:24,500 --> 00:40:26,400
It’s a terrible mistake.

307
00:40:26,500 --> 00:40:29,200
The man, yes. The child, no.

308
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,900
Maybe she’s right.
Maybe we should spare the child.

309
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,300
It is against our will that we stay here.

310
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,000
Do not make the child die
to satisfy him.

311
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:42,200
He does not need any more wives.

312
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:48,500
Yes, he has no more time
for us older wives, just the newest.

313
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:52,100
Jealousy is not part of us.

314
00:40:53,500 --> 00:40:55,900
Why are you so jealous of me?

315
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,900
You are a troublemaker.

316
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,800
You deserve to die!

317
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:08,100
Die? I may die, but I do not care.

318
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,800
The child must live.

319
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:13,500
She is right.
We will not kill the child.

320
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,500
But Manos would not approve.

321
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:21,000
The law of Manos exits for us only.

322
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:24,700
Manos loves women.
She will grow up to be a woman.

323
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,300
She must die.

324
00:41:36,500 --> 00:41:39,900
When the Master hears of this,
he will be furious.

325
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:46,800
You are all mad! Mad, the whole lot of you!

326
00:41:46,900 --> 00:41:49,900
The man, yes. The child, no.

327
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,500
Master, what are you doing here?

328
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,000
You have failed us, Torgo.

329
00:44:29,100 --> 00:44:31,400
I know of your visits to the tomb.

330
00:44:34,500 --> 00:44:36,300
My visits?

331
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:38,700
The women have told me.

332
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:43,000
They may not be able to say anything,
or move when you’re there,

333
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:45,900
but they remember
everything you say to them,

334
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:50,400
and everything you do to them.

335
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:59,800
But Master, you have six wives.
Why can’t I have one for myself?

336
00:44:59,900 --> 00:45:04,500
You’re not one of us,
therefore you cannot have one of them.

337
00:45:04,600 --> 00:45:09,500
But I have one now.
This one is mine. You’ll never get her.

338
00:45:09,600 --> 00:45:12,300
You have failed us, Torgo.

339
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:14,200
For this you must die!

340
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:18,100
Failed you? No.

341
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:21,000
You have failed yourselves.

342
00:45:21,100 --> 00:45:24,500
You’ll never kill them!
I’ll help them!

343
00:45:24,600 --> 00:45:26,600
You have failed...

344
00:45:26,700 --> 00:45:28,500
and you must die!

345
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:39,500
Manos, God of primal darkness,

346
00:46:39,600 --> 00:46:42,500
as thou has decreed, so have I done.

347
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,800
The hands of fate have doomed this man.

348
00:46:47,900 --> 00:46:50,900
Thy will is done.

349
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:34,800
The women are fighting!

350
00:49:19,900 --> 00:49:21,100
What was that?

351
00:49:22,700 --> 00:49:23,900
Michael?

352
00:49:24,000 --> 00:49:25,500
Michael, where are you?

353
00:49:36,700 --> 00:49:39,700
Oh, please, God! Where is Mike?

354
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:08,000
Stop! What foolishness is this?

355
00:50:08,100 --> 00:50:10,000
Manos must be served!

356
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:11,500
There you are!

357
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,400
She is the one!

358
00:50:13,500 --> 00:50:15,100
She has upset all of our plans!

359
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,300
This foolishness must stop!

360
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:44,100
There has been enough trouble.

361
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:46,300
Our purpose must be served.

362
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:48,500
There will be no further insolence.

363
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:53,500
- But the child...
- We cannot kill a child!

364
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,800
Yes, we can!

365
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,200
You have caused enough trouble!

366
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:03,300
As soon as we have disposed of Torgo,
we shall take care of you!

367
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:07,000
Your power fails you; I have no more fear.

368
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:10,700
Seize her! And prepare her for sacrifice!

369
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:32,800
Well done, my wives.

370
00:51:34,300 --> 00:51:37,400
The will of Manos shall be served!

371
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:12,100
Tis the will of Manos
that he be sacrificed.

372
00:52:27,100 --> 00:52:31,400
Kill! Kill! Kill!

373
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,000
Manos has decreed it.

374
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,200
Kill! Kill! Kill!

375
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,200
Mike, help us! Oh, my God!

376
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:02,800
Margaret, open the door!

377
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:07,400
Margaret, open the door!

378
00:54:16,600 --> 00:54:19,300
Enough!
The ceremony is done.

379
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:56,600
Killing doesn’t help anymore!
You’re all finished!

380
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:03,200
You have said enough!

381
00:56:03,300 --> 00:56:06,400
Your turn will come,
as soon as we’ve disposed of the others!

382
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:07,900
Go find the others!

383
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:10,100
Hurry, before the night slips away!

384
00:56:21,400 --> 00:56:24,600
At the window, Mike.
I saw him at that window.

385
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:26,800
Okay, honey. We’ll leave. We’ll leave.

386
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,700
We’ve got to leave now!

387
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:32,400
I can’t stand it any longer!
Please, Mike!

388
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,600
We’ll hide in the desert.
Someone will help.

389
00:56:35,900 --> 00:56:38,700
The gods will destroy you!

390
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:43,000
Your power fails!
You cannot endure!

391
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:45,500
Destroy?

392
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,400
The gods destroy me?

393
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:00,500
Destroy me?
I am permanent!

394
00:57:00,600 --> 00:57:02,300
Manos has made me permanent!

395
00:57:05,600 --> 00:57:08,200
Your power fails you!

396
00:57:08,300 --> 00:57:10,500
You are losing your control!

397
00:57:10,600 --> 00:57:13,000
Even Torgo defied you!

398
00:57:16,600 --> 00:57:20,100
And he was destroyed,
even as you shall be!

399
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:23,800
Your power does not affect me anymore!

400
00:57:23,900 --> 00:57:26,900
Even your other wives
do not trust you!

401
00:57:29,100 --> 00:57:31,500
See? I do not fear you!

402
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:33,300
Eventhough you beat me!

403
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:35,800
Beat me again! Beat! Beat!

404
00:57:46,700 --> 00:57:49,400
I do not fear you!

405
00:58:18,500 --> 00:58:21,700
I can’t go on.
Take Debbie and run.

406
00:58:21,800 --> 00:58:23,900
No, darling. We’ll make it.
Let’s go.

407
00:58:34,900 --> 00:58:37,100
Nothing of that way.
Let’s go this way.

408
00:58:55,700 --> 00:58:57,500
Mike? Mike, are you all right?

409
00:58:57,600 --> 00:58:58,800
Damn...

410
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,700
Mike, we can’t go on this way.

411
00:59:09,700 --> 00:59:11,200
We got to keep going.

412
00:59:18,700 --> 00:59:21,100
They have gone!
They have left the house!

413
00:59:24,800 --> 00:59:26,500
We have searched everywhere.

414
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,300
Find them!
They must not escape!

415
00:59:37,400 --> 00:59:39,500
- Find them!
- No, leave them alone!

416
00:59:39,600 --> 00:59:41,700
We cannot kill a child!

417
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,100
Enough talk!

418
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:44,200
Find them!

419
00:59:44,300 --> 00:59:46,100
Manos will be served!

420
01:00:08,300 --> 01:00:10,400
I can’t make it, Mike!

421
01:00:11,800 --> 01:00:13,400
I can’t make it!

422
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,700
Take the baby!
Take Debbie!

423
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:04,200
No, Maggie, we can make it.

424
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:05,900
We’ll rest here for a minute.

425
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,300
We can make it.

426
01:01:07,400 --> 01:01:08,500
Let’s go back.

427
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:10,400
They’ll never think
of looking for us at the house.

428
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:11,800
You know, you might have a point there.

429
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,700
Please, Mike! Please!
I can’t go any farther!

430
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,200
Listen, we can lock ourselves
in the kitchen. I have my gun.

431
01:01:30,100 --> 01:01:31,600
We’ll have to go back.

432
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,400
Okay. It might be the safest place,

433
01:01:35,500 --> 01:01:38,400
especially since they’re out here,
looking for us.

434
01:01:38,500 --> 01:01:41,400
Daddy, I’m scared.
Where’s my puppy?

435
01:01:41,500 --> 01:01:43,000
Please, Debbie, not now!

436
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:11,800
That sure sounded like shots.
We’d better check.

437
01:02:11,900 --> 01:02:15,800
At this hour of the night? There can’t be
anybody out here – this is the boondocks.

438
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:18,400
Well, sound does travel
a long way at night.

439
01:02:18,500 --> 01:02:20,900
It could be clear over in Mexico,
for that matter.

440
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:11,400
It sure is good to get away.
Damn the rain!

441
01:04:11,500 --> 01:04:14,300
Vacations are fine,
but this one should be great.

442
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:17,700
Yeah, the gang’s coming up
for the weekend. What a blast!

443
01:05:56,100 --> 01:05:57,300
Welcome.

444
01:06:12,300 --> 01:06:14,200
I am Michael.

445
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,900
I take care of the place
while the Master is away.

445
01:06:18,305 --> 01:07:18,613
