1
00:01:21,322 --> 00:01:23,722
- Car smash?
- Yeah.

2
00:01:23,891 --> 00:01:26,689
Cement truck
hit one of those baby Austins.

3
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:29,124
Fractured skull, I guess.

4
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:37,959
You know, a man's a fool
to ride in those miniature cars.

5
00:01:38,138 --> 00:01:42,234
Be yourself.
This is the guy that drove the truck.

6
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:47,213
Aww.

7
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:49,281
- Boy?
- Little girl.

8
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,146
Ah. Ahem. Uh-huh.

9
00:01:53,754 --> 00:01:57,554
Gee, I hope my baby's a boy.

10
00:01:58,025 --> 00:02:01,586
- I'll do my best, Archie.
Attagirl, Mumsy.

11
00:02:04,832 --> 00:02:07,528
Why can't my son have a screen
around his bed?

12
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,636
- It's against the rules.
- But this man has one.

13
00:02:10,804 --> 00:02:13,637
- Yes. He's dying.
- Oh.

14
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:24,644
Oh, nuts.

15
00:02:38,065 --> 00:02:41,000
What makes you think
you want to be a nurse?

16
00:02:41,668 --> 00:02:45,604
Why, nursing people has always seemed
sort of a second nature with me.

17
00:02:46,407 --> 00:02:49,035
This is your only recommendation?

18
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:51,871
Who is this gentleman?
What's his business?

19
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:54,446
- He's a grocer.
- A grocer?

20
00:02:55,949 --> 00:02:59,009
I'm afraid he knows more about groceries
than about hospitals.

21
00:02:59,186 --> 00:03:01,620
What does he mean
"the time you were at high school"?

22
00:03:01,789 --> 00:03:03,984
Didn't you graduate?

23
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,651
No, I had to leave when my mother died
in the third year.

24
00:03:08,629 --> 00:03:11,063
Probationary nurse
must be a high school graduate.

25
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,426
I can make it up easy.
I can go to night school.

26
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,398
You'll have neither the time
nor the strength with work here.

27
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:19,334
- Oh, I'm sure I would...
- Besides, it wouldn't be allowed.

28
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:23,039
But I'm sufficiently well educated.
There must be some way.

29
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,646
- Not here.
- Oh, I'm sure I can make good if...

30
00:03:27,147 --> 00:03:29,012
My decision is final.

31
00:03:49,703 --> 00:03:53,434
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- You are in a hurry, aren't you?

32
00:04:19,867 --> 00:04:22,495
- Did I catch the name?
- Hart. Lora Hart.

33
00:04:22,669 --> 00:04:25,536
Hart. That's a good name for a nurse.

34
00:04:25,706 --> 00:04:28,607
Sturdy instrument, the heart.

35
00:04:30,677 --> 00:04:33,840
- Hello, Miss Dillon.
- Oh, good afternoon, doctor.

36
00:04:34,014 --> 00:04:35,948
Now, what can we do
for this young lady?

37
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,883
My dear,
why didn't you mention the doctor?

38
00:04:40,053 --> 00:04:42,453
Of course, doctor, anything you say.

39
00:04:42,623 --> 00:04:46,354
Well, now, suppose you telephone
the principal of Miss Hart's high school...

40
00:04:46,527 --> 00:04:49,394
and if everything is satisfactory,
we'll waive the rest.

41
00:04:49,563 --> 00:04:51,656
Oh, thank you, doctor.

42
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:54,665
I hope you realize
what you're letting yourself in for.

43
00:04:54,835 --> 00:04:56,928
Nothing can be too hard.

44
00:04:57,104 --> 00:04:59,800
Now, you take care of her,
will you, Miss Dillon?

45
00:04:59,973 --> 00:05:01,304
I've gotta be going.

46
00:05:02,209 --> 00:05:04,643
This lady will take care of you.

47
00:05:07,114 --> 00:05:10,709
By the way, Dillon, you're doing
something wonderful with the hospital.

48
00:05:10,884 --> 00:05:13,352
Everything runs like a clock.

49
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,283
Thank you, doctor.

50
00:05:15,455 --> 00:05:18,856
I'm sorry you didn't mention Dr. Bell
in the beginning.

51
00:05:24,031 --> 00:05:26,124
You'll find life here pleasant enough.

52
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,531
But there's one thing
you must understand thoroughly:

53
00:05:29,703 --> 00:05:31,762
Rules mean something.

54
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,840
- I understand.
- You'll be told about them later.

55
00:05:35,008 --> 00:05:37,533
You'll have one hour to yourself
each afternoon...

56
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:39,372
and your evenings after 7.

57
00:05:39,546 --> 00:05:43,573
But you're to be in bed
and lights out at 10.

58
00:05:43,750 --> 00:05:45,911
There are no exceptions.

59
00:05:46,086 --> 00:05:48,418
This decision is final.

60
00:05:49,790 --> 00:05:52,554
- I, ahem, see.
- Ahem.

61
00:05:53,393 --> 00:05:55,861
You have one night out a week
until 12...

62
00:05:56,029 --> 00:05:59,157
and quite a severe penalty
if you're out later.

63
00:06:00,834 --> 00:06:03,302
Miss Maloney, this is Miss Hart.

64
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,461
How do you do?

65
00:06:06,506 --> 00:06:09,600
Take Miss Hart to the wardrobe
and help her select some uniforms.

66
00:06:09,776 --> 00:06:12,973
She hopes to be a probationer.

67
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:16,711
- Miss Maloney will show you.
- Thank you.

68
00:06:17,384 --> 00:06:22,481
Miss Maloney,
you have no one sleeping in your room.

69
00:06:22,656 --> 00:06:24,146
Miss Hart may go with you.

70
00:06:25,692 --> 00:06:28,559
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, Miss Dillon.

71
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,390
Yes, Miss Dillon.

72
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:41,800
Hype, the new probationer.

73
00:06:41,975 --> 00:06:44,603
- Heads or tails?
- Tails.

74
00:06:44,778 --> 00:06:49,238
Heads. Life is going on for you
in the same old way.

75
00:06:52,219 --> 00:06:55,950
Say, I was afraid the hospital would
burn down before I could get into it.

76
00:06:56,123 --> 00:06:58,182
Now I have to watch myself
with matches.

77
00:06:58,358 --> 00:07:00,223
Well, if you hate it so, why do you stay?

78
00:07:00,394 --> 00:07:03,056
It's the only job I know
where they pay you to learn.

79
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,892
Oh, I'm sure in your heart you love it.

80
00:07:06,366 --> 00:07:10,200
- Says you.
- Yeah, says me in a big way, sister.

81
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,644
Oh. Goodness. Isn't there a smaller one?

82
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,645
If you don't like it, buy your own.

83
00:07:24,017 --> 00:07:26,679
- I can't. I haven't any money.
- Broke?

84
00:07:26,853 --> 00:07:28,582
In a big way, sister.

85
00:07:28,922 --> 00:07:30,856
Any advice?

86
00:07:33,694 --> 00:07:35,787
- What were you doing with the big shot?
- Who?

87
00:07:35,962 --> 00:07:38,487
Dr. Bell. Say, are you kidding me?

88
00:07:38,665 --> 00:07:41,099
- No, why?
- You don't know Bell?

89
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:44,294
He's the chief of staff.
One of the biggest surgeons in America.

90
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:45,836
Really?

91
00:07:46,006 --> 00:07:49,806
Why, he just stopped me in the hall
and offered to help me.

92
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:51,704
Hmm.

93
00:07:51,878 --> 00:07:54,608
For a beginner, you're not doing so bad.

94
00:07:55,449 --> 00:07:58,077
We'll see if we can find one that fits.

95
00:07:59,386 --> 00:08:00,614
Here, try that.

96
00:08:01,521 --> 00:08:05,321
- Oh, that's much better.
- You better slip off your dress.

97
00:08:05,826 --> 00:08:06,850
Oh, it's okay.

98
00:08:07,627 --> 00:08:09,026
Oh, I suppose so.

99
00:08:09,196 --> 00:08:12,893
I guess everybody around here
has seen more than I've got.

100
00:08:28,048 --> 00:08:30,744
Oh, don't be embarrassed.
You can't show me a thing.

101
00:08:30,917 --> 00:08:32,942
I just came from the delivery room.

102
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,111
What are you doing here, baby-frightener?

103
00:08:35,856 --> 00:08:40,623
I come on behalf of this big institution
to welcome the new sister to our midst.

104
00:08:40,794 --> 00:08:43,490
You'll find we're just
one big, happy family here.

105
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:46,592
Beat it, Eagan.

106
00:08:46,767 --> 00:08:49,668
- You're not sore, are you?
I'm not laughing, veterinary.

107
00:08:49,836 --> 00:08:52,031
How'd you like to go back
to your sick horses?

108
00:08:52,205 --> 00:08:54,503
Sometimes I don't like you, Maloney.

109
00:08:55,142 --> 00:08:57,667
If only I could make that permanent.

110
00:08:57,844 --> 00:08:59,778
What do you say, newcomer?

111
00:08:59,946 --> 00:09:03,473
The score is 2-0, favor of the lady.

112
00:09:06,219 --> 00:09:07,743
Hmm.

113
00:09:11,091 --> 00:09:13,685
Take my tip and keep away from interns.

114
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:17,759
They're like cancer.
The disease is known, but not the cure.

115
00:09:17,931 --> 00:09:18,955
Really?

116
00:09:19,132 --> 00:09:22,590
There's only one guy that can do a nurse
any good, a patient with dough.

117
00:09:22,769 --> 00:09:26,261
Catch one with a fever and a low pulse,
make him think you saved his life...

118
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,931
and you'll be getting somewhere.
- Will I?

119
00:09:29,109 --> 00:09:31,100
- And doctors are no good either.
- Oh, no?

120
00:09:31,278 --> 00:09:33,337
What for? They never marry nurses.

121
00:09:33,513 --> 00:09:35,913
And the trouble with interns is they do.

122
00:09:36,082 --> 00:09:40,348
All a wife means to an intern is someone
to sit in his office when he starts practice...

123
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:42,920
and play nurse the rest of her life
without pay.

124
00:09:43,089 --> 00:09:46,616
- Oh, I shouldn't like that.
- Thing to do is to land an appendicitis case.

125
00:09:46,793 --> 00:09:48,761
- They've all got dough.
- Oh.

126
00:09:50,597 --> 00:09:52,724
Gee, you look like an ad
for Sloan's Liniment.

127
00:09:52,899 --> 00:09:56,858
I don't care. As long as it means
I'm not gonna be a probe anymore.

128
00:11:16,483 --> 00:11:18,610
Oh, dear.

129
00:11:18,785 --> 00:11:19,979
Don't cry.

130
00:11:20,153 --> 00:11:22,644
Yes, it's a shame.

131
00:11:22,822 --> 00:11:26,553
Yes, it's a shame. There, there.

132
00:11:49,149 --> 00:11:53,711
Gee, it's half past 1.
I was afraid old hatchet-face would see us.

133
00:11:54,254 --> 00:11:58,213
You sap.
She'll be in here to see if we're in bed.

134
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,485
Oh. We better get in
with all our clothes on.

135
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,755
No, no. Slip your dress off,
put it on the end of the bed here.

136
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:07,422
If she sees that, it's okay.

137
00:12:12,872 --> 00:12:16,171
Gee, if she switches on the lights
and sees my makeup, I'm sunk.

138
00:12:16,343 --> 00:12:19,210
- Well, turn your face to the wall.
- Oh, don't get funny.

139
00:12:19,379 --> 00:12:22,280
My makeup goes around
the back of my neck.

140
00:12:25,719 --> 00:12:27,050
Hurry up, kid.

141
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:31,054
If we're caught this time,
it means a month of no nights off.

142
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:40,428
Oh, some of that goofy Eagan's comedy.

143
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,534
Jump in bed.
I bet hatchet-face heard you.

144
00:12:42,702 --> 00:12:44,101
Oh, I can't. Not with that.

145
00:12:45,472 --> 00:12:46,962
Psst. Get in.

146
00:12:52,979 --> 00:12:54,469
Come in.

147
00:12:55,315 --> 00:12:57,875
Miss Hart, is it possible
you have a man in here?

148
00:12:58,051 --> 00:13:00,611
You worm. I hope you get caught
in the nurses' quarters.

149
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:03,119
- You know what you'll get for that.
Boo!

150
00:13:13,433 --> 00:13:17,267
Here he is again.
Let him have it, and make it a bull's-eye.

151
00:13:19,072 --> 00:13:20,903
Come in.

152
00:13:31,151 --> 00:13:32,641
Who threw that slipper?

153
00:13:36,056 --> 00:13:37,080
What, ma'am?

154
00:13:38,024 --> 00:13:39,787
What, Miss Dillon?

155
00:13:39,959 --> 00:13:41,483
What, Miss Dillon?

156
00:13:41,661 --> 00:13:45,188
Did you throw that slipper?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

157
00:13:46,332 --> 00:13:48,630
Well, Hart?
- Well, you see, I...

158
00:13:48,802 --> 00:13:51,600
Take two weeks on the night shift
at the emergency clinic.

159
00:13:57,977 --> 00:14:00,844
I thought so. You've both just come in.

160
00:14:01,014 --> 00:14:04,347
- We had to walk home.
- This isn't your first offense, Miss Maloney.

161
00:14:04,517 --> 00:14:07,418
You'll take four weeks
on the same night shift.

162
00:14:07,587 --> 00:14:10,112
- Thank you.
- And take two more for impertinence.

163
00:14:19,866 --> 00:14:22,130
See what you get for yelling?

164
00:14:22,302 --> 00:14:25,294
Say, suppose you found a skeleton
in your bed.

165
00:14:25,472 --> 00:14:28,908
If I could dodge that night shift,
I'd live with one.

166
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:37,216
Oh, quit your trembling, kid.
It can't walk around.

167
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:40,409
Dillon's face took all the pep out of it.

168
00:14:44,023 --> 00:14:48,084
Well, at least he can't clear his throat.

169
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,034
Just a scalp wound.

170
00:15:08,381 --> 00:15:11,782
Oh, doctor.
- Hold tight to my hand when it hurts.

171
00:15:12,152 --> 00:15:15,212
You're certainly charitable
with that hand of yours.

172
00:15:15,388 --> 00:15:17,083
Was he hit anywhere else?

173
00:15:17,257 --> 00:15:20,124
Sorry, but that's all.

174
00:15:22,796 --> 00:15:24,457
Just put a bandage on him.

175
00:15:25,799 --> 00:15:27,357
Give him a shot of anti-tetanus.

176
00:15:27,534 --> 00:15:30,367
- What's that for?
- Prevents lockjaw.

177
00:15:30,537 --> 00:15:31,765
Lockjaw?

178
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:35,305
Ask Miss Maloney about it.
She's been fighting it off all her life.

179
00:15:35,475 --> 00:15:36,669
Grit your teeth, prisoner.

180
00:15:36,843 --> 00:15:39,835
Just two more smart cracks
and Dr. Mayo is through.

181
00:15:41,314 --> 00:15:43,111
Shall I take him
to the station house?

182
00:15:43,283 --> 00:15:44,648
Oh, I don't think we'd better.

183
00:15:44,818 --> 00:15:47,184
Let's keep him here tonight.

184
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:50,086
Yeah, prison ward.

185
00:15:58,932 --> 00:16:00,422
Come on.

186
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,431
Come on.

187
00:16:06,539 --> 00:16:08,871
Hey, hey.
The tougher, the softer.

188
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,533
Better get us a lift, lunkhead,
he's fainted.

189
00:16:11,711 --> 00:16:13,110
Huh?

190
00:16:14,681 --> 00:16:18,412
Oh, all right, Florence Nightingale.

191
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:31,325
Could a guy bum some bandages
and iodine in here?

192
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:34,792
- Are you hurt?
- No. It's a friend of mine.

193
00:16:34,968 --> 00:16:36,902
He got a little cut on his hand.

194
00:16:37,070 --> 00:16:40,096
- Come in, I'll see what I can do.
- Oh, maybe I better wait here.

195
00:16:40,974 --> 00:16:43,135
- Come in.
- Ouch!

196
00:16:43,509 --> 00:16:45,704
You're the one that's hurt.

197
00:16:47,013 --> 00:16:49,208
All right, I'll come in.

198
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:53,709
Let's see your hand.

199
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:00,357
You'll have to get up earlier
than most bootleggers to fool me.

200
00:17:00,526 --> 00:17:04,326
- Huh? How do you get that way?
- We get many like you in here.

201
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,795
- Oh, give us the iodine, will you?
- I'll fix it.

202
00:17:06,966 --> 00:17:09,833
Say, I could do it myself
if you'd just give me the...

203
00:17:12,305 --> 00:17:13,704
I guess I better sit down.

204
00:17:18,544 --> 00:17:21,536
- Hey, what's the idea?
- It's the arm, isn't it?

205
00:17:21,714 --> 00:17:23,545
Oh, all right.

206
00:17:25,718 --> 00:17:26,742
This one here.

207
00:17:32,292 --> 00:17:33,953
Thanks.

208
00:17:45,071 --> 00:17:46,402
Say, that's silk.

209
00:17:46,572 --> 00:17:49,405
That's how I know you're a bootlegger.

210
00:17:50,009 --> 00:17:51,806
You win.

211
00:17:53,846 --> 00:17:55,313
That looks like a bullet wound.

212
00:17:55,481 --> 00:17:58,507
Well, it's a cinch
it ain't a vaccination mark.

213
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:05,925
I'll have to make a police report of this.

214
00:18:06,392 --> 00:18:08,792
Yeah? Why?

215
00:18:09,195 --> 00:18:11,288
It has to be done
on all bullet-wound cases.

216
00:18:11,464 --> 00:18:13,455
- Oh, say, that ain't necessary.
- I have to.

217
00:18:13,633 --> 00:18:16,124
Oh, listen, sister,
what's the difference to you?

218
00:18:16,302 --> 00:18:18,361
I could get into trouble if I didn't.

219
00:18:18,638 --> 00:18:21,630
Listen, just give me some bandages
and forget you ever saw me.

220
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,708
How did it happen?

221
00:18:26,879 --> 00:18:31,179
Well, a guy was cleaning a gun
and it went off.

222
00:18:31,351 --> 00:18:32,375
Oh, nonsense.

223
00:18:32,552 --> 00:18:36,989
Well, that's my story, and a couple of cops
with rubber hoses can't make me change it.

224
00:18:38,224 --> 00:18:39,851
Oh.

225
00:18:42,829 --> 00:18:44,626
Where was this man cleaning the gun?

226
00:18:46,132 --> 00:18:47,156
In a limousine.

227
00:18:48,034 --> 00:18:51,435
It hit a bump and the gun went off.

228
00:18:51,771 --> 00:18:53,033
Why did they wanna get you?

229
00:18:53,206 --> 00:18:55,299
Oh, because I won't buy
their bum alcohol.

230
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:57,568
I don't poison people.

231
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:00,645
Why don't you tell who these men are
and have them arrested?

232
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:05,011
For the same reason you don't squeal
about half the raw work you see down here.

233
00:19:09,288 --> 00:19:10,653
What do you mean?

234
00:19:10,823 --> 00:19:14,054
Well, do you?

235
00:19:14,694 --> 00:19:17,458
Why, we have professional ethics.

236
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:21,999
Yeah? That goes for my line too.

237
00:19:23,603 --> 00:19:27,539
The things my profession keep quiet about,
we believe it's for the public's own good.

238
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:30,107
Yeah? Ditto.

239
00:19:35,715 --> 00:19:38,479
Well, it's gone clear through.
You've lost a lot of blood.

240
00:19:42,021 --> 00:19:43,613
What's up?

241
00:19:45,925 --> 00:19:47,187
Say, that's a bullet wound.

242
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,420
Hey, nobody sent for you.
Go rustle your hot-water bottles.

243
00:19:50,596 --> 00:19:52,530
This is no hot-water bottle.

244
00:19:54,534 --> 00:19:57,992
- Did you get this bird's name and address?
- I don't think that's necessary.

245
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:01,106
Don't you know that you're
supposed to report all bullet wounds?

246
00:20:01,274 --> 00:20:03,572
You didn't see any bullet wound.

247
00:20:03,743 --> 00:20:05,370
I didn't?

248
00:20:05,545 --> 00:20:07,638
Say, what's the idea?

249
00:20:07,814 --> 00:20:09,076
Friend of yours?

250
00:20:11,484 --> 00:20:12,508
Thanks, pal.

251
00:20:12,685 --> 00:20:15,210
He'd have to be hot
before I'd take a chance like that.

252
00:20:15,388 --> 00:20:17,822
- You said something, sister.
- Hold quiet, will you?

253
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:19,890
Okay.

254
00:20:21,861 --> 00:20:23,852
Hey, are you really taking a chance?

255
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:28,399
I'll say she is. All a nurse needs to do
is to get into one jam and she's through.

256
00:20:28,568 --> 00:20:30,729
Yeah?
- Oh, don't talk so much.

257
00:20:31,170 --> 00:20:33,365
You might as well turn in
your uniform and quit.

258
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:37,031
Maybe 56 bucks a week isn't much,
but it's 56 bucks.

259
00:20:37,210 --> 00:20:38,734
Hey, is that all they pay you?

260
00:20:38,911 --> 00:20:40,435
Better than selling apples.

261
00:20:40,613 --> 00:20:42,808
That's probably what she'll be doing
if she loses her diploma.

262
00:20:42,982 --> 00:20:44,279
Shh!

263
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:48,578
There you are.
It's a nasty cut, but it'll be all right now.

264
00:20:55,828 --> 00:20:58,353
- Dump this.
- Thanks, sister.

265
00:20:59,699 --> 00:21:00,961
My pal.

266
00:21:04,971 --> 00:21:06,199
What's his trouble?

267
00:21:06,372 --> 00:21:08,306
He fell down stairs and cut his shoulder.

268
00:21:08,474 --> 00:21:12,308
Walks like he'd lost a lot of blood.
No, just drunk.

269
00:21:14,647 --> 00:21:15,773
Oh.

270
00:21:23,322 --> 00:21:27,053
Hey, Maloney,
don't forget to wash that bedpan.

271
00:21:27,827 --> 00:21:30,421
And make it shiny.

272
00:21:31,731 --> 00:21:33,926
Yes, do that.

273
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:49,107
Oh, calm down, Lora.

274
00:21:51,517 --> 00:21:52,848
You've seen blood before.

275
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,510
Just because this is your first
don't make it worse.

276
00:21:55,688 --> 00:21:56,950
- I know...
- Heaven's sakes...

277
00:21:57,123 --> 00:21:59,557
if you get dizzy or feel faint,
keep an eye on me.

278
00:21:59,725 --> 00:22:01,283
Remember, this is the final test.

279
00:22:01,460 --> 00:22:04,623
And if you pass out this time,
you don't graduate.

280
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,328
Okay.

281
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:09,263
Wait a minute.

282
00:22:09,869 --> 00:22:13,361
I almost forgot this.
A man left this here.

283
00:22:13,539 --> 00:22:17,475
He said it was to be given to you
before you went into your big test.

284
00:22:20,346 --> 00:22:22,337
He seemed to think
you'd know who he was.

285
00:22:43,970 --> 00:22:47,235
- Well, of all the...
- That's what I call a pal.

286
00:22:47,406 --> 00:22:49,499
- What'll I do with it?
- Put it away for her.

287
00:22:49,675 --> 00:22:53,167
But you're not allowed to drink.
What's it good for?

288
00:22:53,346 --> 00:22:55,211
It's swell for cleaning teeth.

289
00:23:32,685 --> 00:23:37,315
Boy, are we lucky
to get in on an operation as big as this.

290
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:39,856
Well, I hope Dr. Bell gets away with it.

291
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:42,586
He's got one chance in a hundred.

292
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:04,106
Oxygen.

293
00:25:12,151 --> 00:25:13,550
Does that happen often?

294
00:25:13,719 --> 00:25:16,449
No. But when it does, it's bad news.

295
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,880
It's horrible.

296
00:25:19,058 --> 00:25:22,221
Well, come on, let's get out of here.
My teeth need cleaning.

297
00:25:33,038 --> 00:25:34,505
Now, young ladies...

298
00:25:34,673 --> 00:25:39,372
you who are about to graduate
to the noble profession of nursing...

299
00:25:39,545 --> 00:25:44,175
will recite
the Florence Nightingale pledge.

300
00:25:45,518 --> 00:25:49,955
I solemnly pledge myself before God...

301
00:25:50,122 --> 00:25:52,750
and in the presence of this assembly...

302
00:25:52,925 --> 00:25:59,091
to pass my life in purity
and practice my profession faithfully.

303
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:04,127
I will abstain from whatever
is deleterious and mischievous...

304
00:26:04,303 --> 00:26:09,570
and will not take
or knowingly administer any harmful drug.

305
00:26:09,875 --> 00:26:15,074
I will do all in my power
to elevate the standard of my profession...

306
00:26:15,247 --> 00:26:17,374
and will hold in confidence...

307
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,008
all personal matters
committed to my keeping...

308
00:26:21,187 --> 00:26:24,987
and all family affairs
coming to my knowledge...

309
00:26:25,157 --> 00:26:27,250
in the practice of my calling.

310
00:26:27,726 --> 00:26:33,631
With loyalty will I endeavor
to aid the physician in his work...

311
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:37,098
and devote myself to the welfare...

312
00:26:37,269 --> 00:26:40,761
of those committed to my care.

313
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:13,767
I'm the new night nurse.

314
00:27:13,939 --> 00:27:16,703
Oh? For the two little girls?

315
00:27:16,876 --> 00:27:19,242
Yes. I had them at the hospital
some months ago.

316
00:27:19,411 --> 00:27:20,742
Poor little kiddies.

317
00:27:20,913 --> 00:27:24,405
It's a long time since I've seen them
toddling up these stairs.

318
00:27:27,186 --> 00:27:30,451
- Good night, kiddies.
Good night, Miss Maloney.

319
00:27:30,623 --> 00:27:33,456
Hello there.
- Well, it's about time you showed up.

320
00:27:33,626 --> 00:27:36,390
- I'm dying on my feet.
- How did you wangle me into this job?

321
00:27:36,562 --> 00:27:40,123
I told Svengali the kids knew you
at the hospital and were crazy about you.

322
00:27:40,299 --> 00:27:41,789
Thanks. Who's Svengali?

323
00:27:41,967 --> 00:27:44,026
Dr. Ranger. He's a new one on me.

324
00:27:44,203 --> 00:27:48,105
He's not on any hospital staff I know of,
but he's sure the boss around here.

325
00:27:48,274 --> 00:27:50,640
Why did they take Dr. Bell off the case?

326
00:27:51,110 --> 00:27:52,441
That's what I'd like to know.

327
00:27:53,112 --> 00:27:57,048
Certainly seems funny to me, replacing
a man like Dr. Bell with an unknown.

328
00:27:58,183 --> 00:28:01,584
- Say, there's something screwy about this.
- What do you mean?

329
00:28:01,754 --> 00:28:05,690
Since those kids got back from the hospital,
they've been living on nothing but milk.

330
00:28:05,858 --> 00:28:08,156
That's no cure for anemia,
or malnutrition either.

331
00:28:08,327 --> 00:28:11,057
- I'll say it isn't.
- They were all right at the hospital.

332
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:14,427
- Dr. Bell said they were getting along great.
- Aren't they improving?

333
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:17,330
No, they're getting worse.
And I'm beginning to wonder why.

334
00:28:17,503 --> 00:28:19,403
But why should anyone...?

335
00:28:19,572 --> 00:28:21,267
Oh, you're crazy.

336
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:24,841
Maybe. I don't know a thing.
I just work here.

337
00:28:25,611 --> 00:28:27,636
Any more instructions, Miss Maloney?

338
00:28:27,813 --> 00:28:30,213
No, Miss Hart.
Oh, yes, there's a chart pinned up...

339
00:28:30,382 --> 00:28:32,646
in the kitchenette
beyond the children's room.

340
00:28:32,818 --> 00:28:33,910
- Kitchenette?
- Yeah.

341
00:28:34,086 --> 00:28:37,021
Kitchen, bathroom, sitting room
with every bedroom.

342
00:28:37,189 --> 00:28:41,023
This dump's a palace.
But not for those kids.

343
00:28:44,663 --> 00:28:47,427
And, say,
keep your eye open for old eczema.

344
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,433
- Who?
- Mrs. Maxwell. She's the housekeeper.

345
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:52,400
Wait till you see her.

346
00:28:52,571 --> 00:28:54,198
Well, so long, honey. I got a date.

347
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,136
- With whom?
- Oh, you don't know him.

348
00:28:56,308 --> 00:28:57,639
A gorgeous new boyfriend.

349
00:28:57,810 --> 00:28:59,744
- Intern?
- I should say not.

350
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:01,174
I'm not all crazy.

351
00:29:06,819 --> 00:29:08,150
Children, what are you doing?

352
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:11,448
Miss Hart. Miss Hart.

353
00:29:14,226 --> 00:29:17,024
Stop it. Lie down, both of you.

354
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:24,592
Nanny, you silly little girl.
You shouldn't try things like that.

355
00:29:24,770 --> 00:29:29,230
- You're not strong enough.
- I tried all I could, Desney.

356
00:29:29,408 --> 00:29:31,899
Of course you did, Nanny.

357
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,371
Poor little baby.

358
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:43,315
I didn't mean any harm.

359
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:45,116
I know you didn't, Desney.

360
00:29:45,290 --> 00:29:47,053
But now you must both be quiet.

361
00:29:47,226 --> 00:29:49,786
We will, won't we, Nanny?

362
00:29:49,962 --> 00:29:52,522
- Yes. We will.
That's good.

363
00:29:52,698 --> 00:29:57,362
We like you. Don't we, Nanny?
Mm-hm.

364
00:29:57,970 --> 00:30:01,235
What's your other name?
You didn't tell us at the hospital.

365
00:30:01,407 --> 00:30:03,341
It's Lora. Lora Hart.

366
00:30:03,509 --> 00:30:06,171
Lora? We had a sister named Lora.

367
00:30:06,345 --> 00:30:07,937
But she's dead.

368
00:30:08,981 --> 00:30:11,040
Oh, poor little baby.

369
00:30:11,216 --> 00:30:12,843
You mustn't talk about her anymore.

370
00:30:13,018 --> 00:30:15,646
She was runned over. She was all cut.

371
00:30:15,821 --> 00:30:18,483
Cut in lots of places, wasn't she, Nanny?

372
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:23,288
All over, here and here and here.

373
00:30:23,462 --> 00:30:26,090
Oh, you ought to seen her.

374
00:30:26,732 --> 00:30:29,860
You mustn't think about her.
You must go to sleep, both of you.

375
00:30:30,035 --> 00:30:32,503
We didn't see her, but they told us.

376
00:30:32,671 --> 00:30:35,265
Nick told us, and he showed us too.

377
00:30:35,441 --> 00:30:37,568
- Who's Nick?
He lives here.

378
00:30:37,743 --> 00:30:40,211
- That's not your father, is it?
- No.

379
00:30:40,379 --> 00:30:42,506
Daddy's up in heaven too.

380
00:30:43,115 --> 00:30:45,583
Oh, I'm sorry.

381
00:30:46,685 --> 00:30:48,915
Now, come on, both of you. Into bed.

382
00:30:49,088 --> 00:30:53,081
Nick's not like Daddy.
Daddy was a nice man.

383
00:30:53,258 --> 00:30:54,850
Isn't Nick a nice man?

384
00:30:55,260 --> 00:30:57,854
No. He's a horrid man. Isn't he, Nanny?

385
00:31:00,265 --> 00:31:02,665
Oh, Nanny, darling, don't cry, honey.

386
00:31:03,202 --> 00:31:06,501
Such a nice home, lovely things...

387
00:31:06,672 --> 00:31:08,970
and you're going to get well real soon.

388
00:31:09,141 --> 00:31:11,132
It isn't a lovely home.

389
00:31:11,310 --> 00:31:13,369
We didn't wanna come home.
Did we, Nanny?

390
00:31:13,545 --> 00:31:14,637
No.

391
00:31:14,813 --> 00:31:16,178
Nick scares us.

392
00:31:16,348 --> 00:31:17,747
Doesn't he, Nanny?

393
00:31:17,916 --> 00:31:19,941
He says the most awful things.

394
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:22,713
You should tell your mother.
We can't.

395
00:31:22,888 --> 00:31:26,289
She won't come and see us anymore.

396
00:31:26,859 --> 00:31:29,157
Why aren't you two asleep?

397
00:31:31,063 --> 00:31:35,329
- They shouldn't be kept awake like this.
- I've been trying to make them go to sleep.

398
00:31:35,501 --> 00:31:37,492
That's true.
- Then why didn't you?

399
00:31:37,669 --> 00:31:40,263
We were hungry. Weren't we, Nanny?

400
00:31:40,439 --> 00:31:42,236
Hungry? Don't be absurd.

401
00:31:42,407 --> 00:31:46,002
But we are hungry. We're always hungry.

402
00:31:46,178 --> 00:31:49,545
- I want to speak to you.
Are you Mrs. Maxwell?

403
00:31:49,715 --> 00:31:52,912
Yes. I have charge of the children.

404
00:31:53,085 --> 00:31:56,350
I don't want to hear another word
out of you, either of you.

405
00:32:02,361 --> 00:32:04,420
I wish we had something to eat.

406
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:07,429
Shh, or she'll come back.

407
00:32:08,734 --> 00:32:12,500
Miss Hart, I must warn you not to be upset
by anything the children may tell you.

408
00:32:12,671 --> 00:32:13,968
They've been very sick.

409
00:32:14,139 --> 00:32:16,403
Yes, I know.
I had charge of them at the hospital.

410
00:32:17,576 --> 00:32:18,668
Oh.

411
00:32:18,844 --> 00:32:21,870
Since they've been home,
they've had bad dreams. Nightmares.

412
00:32:22,047 --> 00:32:24,481
Dr. Ranger says
that's all part of their illness.

413
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:29,148
But they're too young to know
the difference between dreams and facts.

414
00:32:30,322 --> 00:32:33,314
You must realize that
whenever they tell you anything.

415
00:32:34,793 --> 00:32:37,921
I see. Thank you.

416
00:32:40,199 --> 00:32:42,690
That's all I had to say.

417
00:33:12,231 --> 00:33:14,028
Who are you?

418
00:33:18,804 --> 00:33:20,396
What do you want?

419
00:33:20,572 --> 00:33:23,666
A lady needs a little assistance.

420
00:33:23,842 --> 00:33:24,900
What lady?

421
00:33:25,077 --> 00:33:28,046
Shh. You'll never guess.

422
00:33:53,805 --> 00:33:56,831
What happened?
She passed out.

423
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,714
Who is it, Mrs. Ritchey?
The children's mother?

424
00:34:04,616 --> 00:34:07,380
Hm? What did you say?

425
00:34:26,104 --> 00:34:29,073
Are you going to be decent and leave?

426
00:34:30,442 --> 00:34:32,501
I've got to undress her.

427
00:34:33,178 --> 00:34:34,440
It's all right.

428
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,549
Just the type.

429
00:34:40,986 --> 00:34:42,453
Huh?

430
00:34:43,055 --> 00:34:44,852
What did you say?

431
00:35:01,473 --> 00:35:04,874
- Come here.
- Cut that out.

432
00:35:11,083 --> 00:35:15,645
Leave me alone.
I want a kiss. I want a kiss.

433
00:35:18,523 --> 00:35:20,081
I tell you, I want a kiss.

434
00:35:20,258 --> 00:35:22,055
Stop it!

435
00:35:24,229 --> 00:35:26,663
Let me alone.

436
00:35:43,281 --> 00:35:44,771
- Thank you.
- Never mind that.

437
00:35:44,950 --> 00:35:47,510
- Get busy, give her a stomach wash.
- I'll call a doctor.

438
00:35:47,686 --> 00:35:49,984
Listen. You'll do what I tell you.

439
00:35:50,489 --> 00:35:53,481
- You trying to do what he did?
- No, but you're not gonna call.

440
00:35:53,658 --> 00:35:56,991
- You're a nurse. You give her the wash.
- I can't, except under orders.

441
00:35:57,162 --> 00:36:00,029
Oh, yes, you can.
And what's more, you will.

442
00:36:00,198 --> 00:36:03,292
I can't very well with a broken wrist.

443
00:36:10,876 --> 00:36:14,243
- Operator, get me a doctor, quick.
- End that or I'll break your neck.

444
00:36:14,413 --> 00:36:15,903
- What right have you to?
- Plenty.

445
00:36:16,081 --> 00:36:18,549
- Hello, big boy.
- Oh, shut up.

446
00:36:18,717 --> 00:36:22,209
Oh, don't be sore, Nicky. Kiss me.

447
00:36:22,387 --> 00:36:24,878
- Get busy.
- I can't without the proper authority.

448
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:26,957
- I give you the authority.
- Who are you?

449
00:36:27,125 --> 00:36:30,788
I'm Nick, the chauffeur.

450
00:36:32,931 --> 00:36:34,421
Oh.

451
00:36:36,101 --> 00:36:39,537
Operator? Operator? Operator?

452
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:52,507
Don't be sore, big boy.
Where you going?

453
00:37:55,981 --> 00:37:58,245
You dirty, lousy...

454
00:38:09,261 --> 00:38:12,526
And I tell you, I wouldn't go through
another night like that again...

455
00:38:12,697 --> 00:38:15,598
for all the money they could pay me.
- Well, then what?

456
00:38:15,767 --> 00:38:19,601
I locked the doors and windows and sat up
until morning expecting that brute back.

457
00:38:19,771 --> 00:38:21,170
- Well, did he?
- No, but...

458
00:38:21,339 --> 00:38:25,298
I see. It's unfortunate, Miss Hart, but not
much likelihood of its happening again.

459
00:38:25,477 --> 00:38:27,138
I'm going to make sure it doesn't.

460
00:38:27,312 --> 00:38:28,643
- Forget it.
- The police.

461
00:38:28,813 --> 00:38:30,508
- What'll that get you?
- You don't...

462
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:32,513
- Who'd believe you?
- Believe me?

463
00:38:32,684 --> 00:38:35,050
The Ritcheys
wouldn't let you get away with that.

464
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:37,154
Blackmail's a pretty dangerous game.

465
00:38:37,322 --> 00:38:38,755
- Blackmail?
- You heard me.

466
00:38:38,924 --> 00:38:41,722
- Well, then, you don't believe me?
- Why should I?

467
00:38:41,893 --> 00:38:44,555
- But, Dr. Ranger...
- I visited that house daily for months.

468
00:38:44,729 --> 00:38:48,495
- And I see no evidence of all this rot.
- Oh, yes, you have. You know you have.

469
00:38:48,667 --> 00:38:52,068
I thought you were a reputable physician.
I came here to ask your advice.

470
00:38:52,237 --> 00:38:54,262
You shall have it:
Mind your own business.

471
00:38:54,439 --> 00:38:58,432
You're in that house to watch two patients,
not to oversee the conduct of its members.

472
00:38:58,610 --> 00:39:00,373
Am I to take blows from its servants?

473
00:39:00,545 --> 00:39:03,241
- I've said that wouldn't happen again.
- You guarantee that?

474
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:04,507
That'll do, Miss Hart.

475
00:39:04,683 --> 00:39:06,878
You've forgotten your place long enough.

476
00:39:07,052 --> 00:39:09,987
Quiet down, now,
and I'll see that you're fully compensated.

477
00:39:10,155 --> 00:39:11,349
- Is that all?
- It isn't.

478
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:13,548
- Well?
- Something's gotta be done.

479
00:39:13,725 --> 00:39:15,989
- You speaking of my patients?
- You are the doctor.

480
00:39:16,161 --> 00:39:18,493
The way things are going,
those babies won't last.

481
00:39:18,663 --> 00:39:19,755
Well, that's news to me.

482
00:39:19,931 --> 00:39:22,729
Dr. Ranger, they're slowly dying
of undernourishment.

483
00:39:22,901 --> 00:39:27,270
- Aren't my instructions being followed?
- I suppose so. Here.

484
00:39:29,307 --> 00:39:31,138
See about...

485
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:33,902
Yeah, quite correct.

486
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,843
But I know starvation symptoms
when I see them.

487
00:39:37,015 --> 00:39:39,006
- I take it you don't approve...
- No, I don't.

488
00:39:39,184 --> 00:39:41,550
- It's your first case, isn't it?
- Well, what of it?

489
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:42,914
You've been on one night.

490
00:39:43,088 --> 00:39:44,214
It's only natural...

491
00:39:44,389 --> 00:39:47,984
that you should get excited
about something that puzzles you.

492
00:39:48,159 --> 00:39:50,423
You know, Miss Hart, you talk too much.

493
00:39:50,595 --> 00:39:53,655
You've picked up half-baked
medical knowledge around the hospital.

494
00:39:53,832 --> 00:39:55,493
All nurses do.

495
00:39:55,667 --> 00:39:59,330
I wouldn't air it quite so freely.
You'll talk yourself out of your profession.

496
00:39:59,504 --> 00:40:03,668
- Don't think you can muzzle me.
- I'm not trying to. I'm giving you advice.

497
00:40:03,842 --> 00:40:06,333
- You don't wanna take it, get off the case.
- I resign.

498
00:40:06,945 --> 00:40:09,641
I warn you, if you do,
you're through as a licensed nurse.

499
00:40:09,814 --> 00:40:12,908
- Oh, a threat?
- Exactly. Your kind is too dangerous.

500
00:40:13,485 --> 00:40:15,680
I have no doubt of it,
to your kind of doctor...

501
00:40:15,854 --> 00:40:18,914
but I'm gonna find someone
who will listen to me.

502
00:40:25,063 --> 00:40:27,998
Riverside 12468.

503
00:40:29,768 --> 00:40:31,395
Hello.

504
00:40:32,871 --> 00:40:35,567
Uh, Nick, this is Dr. Ranger.

505
00:40:35,740 --> 00:40:38,732
Now, listen carefully
and I'll tell you what I want you to do.

506
00:40:39,778 --> 00:40:41,040
I know it's my first case.

507
00:40:41,212 --> 00:40:45,080
And I know Dr. Ranger's a big man,
but I've got to do something.

508
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,047
You got me the job, that's why I came.

509
00:40:47,218 --> 00:40:49,846
- But, my dear child...
- I'm sorry to drag you into this.

510
00:40:50,021 --> 00:40:53,513
But those poor little kids are starving.
Anybody can see it in their faces.

511
00:40:53,692 --> 00:40:56,217
And if somebody doesn't do something,
they won't last.

512
00:40:56,394 --> 00:40:57,918
Don't get so worked up about it.

513
00:40:58,096 --> 00:41:00,189
Don't you think I know
starvation symptoms?

514
00:41:00,365 --> 00:41:03,732
- Yes, I suppose you do.
- Well, then, won't you do something?

515
00:41:03,902 --> 00:41:06,427
You know I can't interfere
in another doctor's case.

516
00:41:06,604 --> 00:41:08,868
Why can't you, when things like this
are going on?

517
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,065
Why? It's about as unethical...

518
00:41:11,242 --> 00:41:14,871
Oh, ethics, ethics! That's all I've heard
since I've been in this business.

519
00:41:15,046 --> 00:41:16,513
Isn't there any humanity in it?

520
00:41:16,681 --> 00:41:19,309
Aren't there any ethics
about letting babies be murdered?

521
00:41:19,484 --> 00:41:21,748
Steady. You need proof
when you talk that way.

522
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:24,514
What more proof do I need
than what I've already got?

523
00:41:24,856 --> 00:41:26,687
Well, why don't you cool down a bit?

524
00:41:26,858 --> 00:41:29,156
Those kids were getting along
when you had them.

525
00:41:29,327 --> 00:41:31,591
- Why were you taken off the case?
- I don't know.

526
00:41:31,763 --> 00:41:34,129
Ranger's a rotten doctor.
You know his reputation.

527
00:41:34,299 --> 00:41:36,199
- I can't discuss that.
- It isn't ethical.

528
00:41:36,368 --> 00:41:39,735
Well, I can. Why doesn't he belong
to the medical association?

529
00:41:39,904 --> 00:41:42,395
Why hasn't he got a job
on some decent hospital staff?

530
00:41:42,574 --> 00:41:46,305
Because he's shady, and you know it,
as well as every other doctor in this city.

531
00:41:46,478 --> 00:41:50,505
I know a lot of things inside
the profession that I can't advertise.

532
00:41:50,682 --> 00:41:53,879
I also know that Dr. Ranger
has a tremendous practice.

533
00:41:54,052 --> 00:41:56,111
And that alone
can keep him out of trouble.

534
00:41:56,287 --> 00:41:59,620
If I stir things up, if I go to the authorities,
what does it look like?

535
00:41:59,791 --> 00:42:02,282
- Jealousy.
- Argue yourself out of your responsibility.

536
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:04,792
- I'll see this through.
- Will you be reasonable?

537
00:42:04,963 --> 00:42:06,988
No! I won't see this
go on another minute.

538
00:42:07,165 --> 00:42:08,792
- I'm going to the police.
- Lora!

539
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:11,260
Don't you realize
they'll only laugh at you?

540
00:42:11,436 --> 00:42:15,839
You, a nurse on her first job, trying to pit
your opinion against a man like Dr. Ranger.

541
00:42:16,007 --> 00:42:17,872
Oh, what'll I do? It's maddening.

542
00:42:18,042 --> 00:42:19,634
Two little babies being murdered.

543
00:42:19,811 --> 00:42:22,006
I could go out and yell it on the street.

544
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:25,274
Listen, you've got to convince people
that what you say is true.

545
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,850
- How?
- Hysterics won't do it.

546
00:42:28,019 --> 00:42:30,920
I'll calm down,
if you'll only tell me what to do.

547
00:42:31,089 --> 00:42:33,580
- My advice is for you to go back on that job.
- What?

548
00:42:33,758 --> 00:42:35,851
If you are convinced of malpractice...

549
00:42:36,027 --> 00:42:40,020
you can do more good there than
you can shouting around on the outside.

550
00:42:40,198 --> 00:42:42,632
Go back and watch those kids.

551
00:42:42,801 --> 00:42:45,736
We've got to play Ranger
at his own game.

552
00:42:46,371 --> 00:42:50,535
It's a risky business,
and it's right under Ranger's nose.

553
00:42:50,708 --> 00:42:55,475
But if he wants to murder those youngsters,
we'll make him use a gun.

554
00:42:56,047 --> 00:42:59,210
I came to apologize
for the way I acted this morning.

555
00:42:59,884 --> 00:43:02,284
So you've thought it over?

556
00:43:02,454 --> 00:43:04,046
Yes, I'm terribly sorry.

557
00:43:04,222 --> 00:43:07,191
I hadn't gotten over
the shock of last night.

558
00:43:07,358 --> 00:43:10,384
I didn't realize what I was saying.
I hope you'll overlook it.

559
00:43:11,930 --> 00:43:13,192
Who were you talking to?

560
00:43:13,832 --> 00:43:17,461
Why, I didn't discuss it with anyone.

561
00:43:17,635 --> 00:43:19,762
I just sat in the park
and thought things over.

562
00:43:19,938 --> 00:43:22,873
I realized I was simply
throwing my career away.

563
00:43:23,041 --> 00:43:24,565
And I can't do that.

564
00:43:26,344 --> 00:43:28,175
I thought you'd come around.

565
00:43:28,346 --> 00:43:30,541
You're not the first
hysterical nurse I've seen.

566
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:33,707
- You'll forgive me, then?
- Entirely forgotten.

567
00:43:33,885 --> 00:43:36,319
On both sides.

568
00:43:36,821 --> 00:43:40,018
- That little business of last night?
- Oh, yes, of course.

569
00:43:40,191 --> 00:43:43,752
I understand that such occurrences
are all part of a nurse's experience.

570
00:43:43,928 --> 00:43:45,452
That's it exactly.

571
00:43:46,331 --> 00:43:49,425
Let me give you
a little friendly advice, my dear.

572
00:43:49,968 --> 00:43:53,802
The successful nurse
is the one who keeps her mouth shut.

573
00:43:54,572 --> 00:43:58,338
You see, we doctors have to do it.
It's part of our professional ethics.

574
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:02,139
So naturally, we want nurses
whose discretion we can rely upon.

575
00:44:02,313 --> 00:44:04,474
I realize that now.

576
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:08,114
Good. Come on, run along, now,
back to your case.

577
00:44:08,286 --> 00:44:12,222
- I'm sure everything's going to be pleasant.
- You're generous to keep me on.

578
00:44:12,390 --> 00:44:15,382
Since we understand
each other, Miss Hart...

579
00:44:15,560 --> 00:44:17,994
I shall probably have
considerable work for you.

580
00:44:18,162 --> 00:44:21,689
- Oh, do you think so?
- I like your spirit.

581
00:44:21,866 --> 00:44:25,324
Just put it to use in the interest
of your doctor, can you?

582
00:44:25,503 --> 00:44:27,164
I think I can.

583
00:44:27,338 --> 00:44:31,399
- Good afternoon, doctor.
- Good afternoon, Miss Hart.

584
00:44:34,913 --> 00:44:37,973
How do you do?
I was told you wished to see me.

585
00:44:38,149 --> 00:44:41,050
Oh, yes, I have wanted
to talk with you...

586
00:44:41,219 --> 00:44:42,743
but, oh, my head hurt so.

587
00:44:42,921 --> 00:44:45,446
I hope it feels better now.

588
00:44:45,623 --> 00:44:50,060
You know, if people only knew
the tortures of neurasthenia...

589
00:44:50,228 --> 00:44:52,662
they'd forgive us everything.

590
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:56,527
You see, Dr. Ranger
forgot to send my bromides.

591
00:44:56,701 --> 00:44:58,134
Oh.

592
00:44:58,303 --> 00:45:01,602
I do hope you weren't too upset
by the conduct of the chauffeur.

593
00:45:02,974 --> 00:45:04,965
You know...
Now, listen, Poochie, stop that.

594
00:45:05,143 --> 00:45:08,135
You know, we discovered,
for some strange reason...

595
00:45:08,313 --> 00:45:12,841
that Nick seems to irritate me
less than any of the other servants.

596
00:45:13,017 --> 00:45:19,513
So as far as feasible, Dr. Ranger
wanted him to be my personal attendant.

597
00:45:19,958 --> 00:45:21,516
Well, we'll just forget about it.

598
00:45:21,993 --> 00:45:26,157
I'm sure you understand
how much I'm depending upon you.

599
00:45:26,331 --> 00:45:29,767
I'll do everything I can
to help the children. Is that all?

600
00:45:29,934 --> 00:45:32,903
- Oh, I want you to have this, Miss Hart.
- Why, I...

601
00:45:33,071 --> 00:45:36,802
Just a little appreciation
of your tactful conduct.

602
00:45:36,975 --> 00:45:39,500
Oh, thank you very much. Is that all?

603
00:45:39,677 --> 00:45:42,840
I'll be sending for you soon.

604
00:45:50,989 --> 00:45:54,186
Well, Poochie,
now we can have a drink, huh?

605
00:46:01,933 --> 00:46:03,798
Well, what'd she want?

606
00:46:03,968 --> 00:46:06,266
- Gee, a hundred bucks.
- Yeah, isn't that a scream?

607
00:46:06,437 --> 00:46:08,496
Hey, don't handle it like it's rubber.

608
00:46:08,673 --> 00:46:10,868
I won't get very much kick
out of spending it.

609
00:46:11,042 --> 00:46:14,808
Listen, belle, for a hundred bucks,
I'd take a couple of socks on the chin.

610
00:46:14,979 --> 00:46:16,970
Funny what people think money will do.

611
00:46:17,148 --> 00:46:21,209
Keeping our nose out of patients' private
affairs is part of our professional ethics.

612
00:46:21,386 --> 00:46:23,650
I'll kill the next one
that says "ethics" to me.

613
00:46:23,821 --> 00:46:26,949
- Says you.
- Yeah, says me in a big way, sister.

614
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:35,924
Will you make this up for me?

615
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:38,295
For the little girls, eh?
Are they any better?

616
00:46:38,469 --> 00:46:39,766
I wish I thought so.

617
00:46:39,937 --> 00:46:42,064
My pal.

618
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:46,132
Well, of all the places.
And drinking a soda too.

619
00:46:46,310 --> 00:46:48,141
Why not? Have one?

620
00:46:48,312 --> 00:46:49,973
Why not?

621
00:46:50,148 --> 00:46:52,446
- One of the same.
Yes, sir.

622
00:46:53,551 --> 00:46:58,386
- How's your friend's hand?
- Oh, fine.

623
00:46:58,556 --> 00:47:00,547
Good as new.

624
00:47:00,725 --> 00:47:03,888
- Say, you're looking pretty hot yourself.
- Thanks.

625
00:47:11,569 --> 00:47:13,628
Hey, where'd you get that?

626
00:47:15,673 --> 00:47:17,231
Looks like somebody took a swing.

627
00:47:17,408 --> 00:47:20,172
Oh, a chauffeur
at the place where I work got fresh.

628
00:47:20,344 --> 00:47:22,437
He socked you? On the level?

629
00:47:22,613 --> 00:47:24,638
Well, not exactly on the level.

630
00:47:24,816 --> 00:47:27,546
From a way down here someplace.

631
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,084
Why, the dirty...

632
00:47:29,253 --> 00:47:31,380
- I'll get him.
- What do you mean?

633
00:47:31,556 --> 00:47:34,684
Say, listen. I know a couple of guys
who'll do it as a pleasure.

634
00:47:34,859 --> 00:47:37,555
- You wouldn't do anything like that?
- I don't do a thing...

635
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,391
but tell a couple of guys
I don't like this bozo.

636
00:47:41,165 --> 00:47:44,430
- Anyhow, you don't know who he is.
- All you gotta do is tell me.

637
00:47:44,602 --> 00:47:48,299
I should say not.
I don't want you getting in a jam over me.

638
00:47:48,973 --> 00:47:51,737
There's nobody
I'd rather get in a jam over.

639
00:47:51,909 --> 00:47:55,401
Well, maybe there's nobody
I'd rather keep out of a jam.

640
00:47:55,580 --> 00:47:57,946
- Honest?
- Maybe.

641
00:47:58,116 --> 00:48:00,209
I tried to get you at the hospital.

642
00:48:00,384 --> 00:48:01,908
Oh, I'm on private duty now.

643
00:48:02,086 --> 00:48:03,110
- Nights?
- Mm-hm.

644
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:04,948
Then how about a buggy ride
some afternoon?

645
00:48:05,123 --> 00:48:06,954
Nurses have reputations.

646
00:48:07,125 --> 00:48:09,457
Oh, I see.

647
00:48:09,794 --> 00:48:12,592
What would you say if I told you
I'd quit the racket?

648
00:48:13,097 --> 00:48:15,657
- I'd say I didn't believe you.
- Well, I did.

649
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:17,425
A month ago.

650
00:48:17,602 --> 00:48:20,400
So how about a ride some afternoon?
Tomorrow afternoon.

651
00:48:21,272 --> 00:48:23,763
- What do you say?
- I'd like to, but I hadn't better.

652
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:27,240
Oh, come on. I've been crazy to see you
ever since that night.

653
00:48:27,411 --> 00:48:28,537
When I go riding...

654
00:48:28,713 --> 00:48:31,511
it isn't gonna be with anybody
that's liable to get shot.

655
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:35,243
- But I tell you I'm all washed up.
- And I tell you I don't believe you.

656
00:48:35,419 --> 00:48:37,046
On the level, sister.

657
00:48:37,755 --> 00:48:40,986
Hey, you.
Those two mugs won't wait forever.

658
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,593
Okay, I'm coming.

659
00:48:43,928 --> 00:48:46,419
- Say, we're just going to see the fights.
- Mm-hm.

660
00:48:46,597 --> 00:48:48,258
Honest.

661
00:48:48,432 --> 00:48:50,457
I'll find you sometime
and prove I'm on the level.

662
00:48:50,635 --> 00:48:53,103
- Hmm.
- So long, sister.

663
00:49:12,690 --> 00:49:14,817
- How is she?
- She dozed off at last.

664
00:49:14,992 --> 00:49:16,323
Oh, thank goodness.

665
00:49:16,494 --> 00:49:18,792
Say, when did you take
to worrying so much?

666
00:49:18,963 --> 00:49:21,431
I didn't realize it was so serious.

667
00:49:21,599 --> 00:49:25,057
It's sort of gotten on my nerves lately.

668
00:49:25,236 --> 00:49:27,067
It's about time.

669
00:49:27,238 --> 00:49:31,265
And I heard something yesterday
that I didn't like.

670
00:49:31,442 --> 00:49:32,670
What?

671
00:49:32,844 --> 00:49:37,338
Well, I'll tell you about it
when I'm sure it's true.

672
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:42,809
Lora's late again. She would be.
Every time I've had a decent date.

673
00:49:43,588 --> 00:49:46,352
I think I'll blow
and let you watch the kids till she comes.

674
00:49:46,524 --> 00:49:48,822
Oh, you mustn't,
with Nanny as low as she is.

675
00:49:48,993 --> 00:49:52,724
- I wouldn't know what to do.
- Keep your chemise on, I didn't mean it.

676
00:49:52,897 --> 00:49:55,365
If she wakes up,
hadn't we better try paregoric?

677
00:49:55,533 --> 00:49:58,331
A lot of good that'll do
if she can't retain a Murphy drip.

678
00:49:58,502 --> 00:50:02,302
Oh, I wish Dr. Ranger would come.
He'd know what to do.

679
00:50:02,473 --> 00:50:04,532
Yeah. He would, all right.

680
00:50:04,709 --> 00:50:08,702
I wish you'd try a milk bath.
My sister Edna saved her baby that way.

681
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:12,179
- She did, I tell you, I was there.
- Well, let's not go into that again.

682
00:50:12,350 --> 00:50:15,547
- But if it worked once...
- It was a mistake.

683
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,483
Well, it's about time.

684
00:50:17,655 --> 00:50:19,088
- Good evening.
Good evening.

685
00:50:19,257 --> 00:50:22,283
Where've you been?
That rich boyfriend of mine is waiting again.

686
00:50:22,460 --> 00:50:24,985
Is that so? I just saw Eagan downstairs.

687
00:50:25,162 --> 00:50:27,630
He tried to duck, but I saw him.

688
00:50:28,132 --> 00:50:30,999
I thought you was out delivering gin
with that crush of yours.

689
00:50:31,168 --> 00:50:34,103
I haven't seen him but once
since that night in the drugstore.

690
00:50:34,272 --> 00:50:37,400
Say, look, won't Nanny love that?

691
00:50:38,075 --> 00:50:39,872
Not the way she was feeling today.

692
00:50:40,044 --> 00:50:42,842
- Is she worse?
- Yeah, took a nosedive.

693
00:50:43,014 --> 00:50:45,073
I had to send Desney
to Mrs. Maxwell's room.

694
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:48,275
- Nanny can't keep anything down or up.
- Did you try a Murphy drip?

695
00:50:48,452 --> 00:50:51,182
- Mm-hm.
- Oh, the poor little baby.

696
00:50:53,658 --> 00:50:56,058
- Have you called Dr. Ranger?
- Yeah, I can't get him.

697
00:50:56,227 --> 00:50:58,661
He's in Jersey on a case.

698
00:50:58,829 --> 00:51:00,820
Well, I've done all I can do
without orders.

699
00:51:00,998 --> 00:51:05,935
You could give her a milk bath.
My sister saved her baby with one.

700
00:51:06,103 --> 00:51:09,129
You've got her started again.
Well, good night, kid.

701
00:51:09,307 --> 00:51:11,901
And good luck.
And if you need me, give me a ring.

702
00:51:12,076 --> 00:51:13,634
All right.

703
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:18,573
Why won't you try a milk bath?

704
00:51:18,749 --> 00:51:21,081
She couldn't absorb nourishment
through her pores.

705
00:51:21,252 --> 00:51:23,379
But she might. We could try.

706
00:51:23,554 --> 00:51:27,115
Oh, I didn't realize it was this serious.

707
00:51:27,291 --> 00:51:32,957
- Poor kids, the way we treated them.
Shh. You'll wake her.

708
00:51:35,633 --> 00:51:38,261
Nanny. Nanny.

709
00:51:38,436 --> 00:51:40,563
Look what I brought you.

710
00:52:04,862 --> 00:52:08,354
Pardon me.
Could you tell me where Mrs. Ritchey is?

711
00:52:08,532 --> 00:52:10,363
Say, what's going on here?

712
00:52:10,534 --> 00:52:12,764
- A costume party?
- Well, as I live and breathe.

713
00:52:12,937 --> 00:52:14,268
Now, wait a minute. Hold on...

714
00:52:14,438 --> 00:52:15,928
Control yourself, big boy.

715
00:52:16,107 --> 00:52:18,132
- You don't know her.
- Yes, I do.

716
00:52:18,309 --> 00:52:21,437
One time, I had a pain and the doctor
put a big cone over my face...

717
00:52:21,612 --> 00:52:23,341
and told me to take a deep breath.

718
00:52:23,514 --> 00:52:25,744
And I did and I floated right up
through the cone...

719
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:28,749
and when I came out the other end,
there she was.

720
00:52:35,826 --> 00:52:38,488
- What have we here?
- Why, it's little Miss lodine herself.

721
00:52:38,662 --> 00:52:41,324
Do you know where I can find Mrs. Ritchey?
It's important.

722
00:52:41,499 --> 00:52:44,229
Well, if you're soliciting for a hospital,
you're too soon.

723
00:52:44,402 --> 00:52:46,097
Mrs. Ritchey won't need you till morning.

724
00:52:55,279 --> 00:52:58,476
Do you belong here?
- Yes. Do you know where Mrs. Ritchey is?

725
00:52:58,649 --> 00:53:00,173
She's the latest innovation.

726
00:53:00,351 --> 00:53:03,616
All the newest household bars
have attachable sick nurses.

727
00:53:05,456 --> 00:53:07,947
What's known as
the morning-after pickup.

728
00:53:08,125 --> 00:53:09,752
Pickup, yeah, whatever.

729
00:53:16,834 --> 00:53:20,099
Mack, go back and be barkeeper.

730
00:53:20,271 --> 00:53:23,729
Ah, shut up.
Go back and be barkeeper.

731
00:53:23,908 --> 00:53:25,808
Tishy wants a drink.

732
00:53:26,844 --> 00:53:31,247
- Oh, Tishy wants a drink, Mack.
- Mrs. Ritchey. Mrs. Ritchey.

733
00:53:32,550 --> 00:53:35,110
- What?
- I wanna speak to you.

734
00:53:35,286 --> 00:53:39,086
Yeah? Well, go back of the bar
and give Tishy a little drink.

735
00:53:39,490 --> 00:53:42,482
Nanny is very ill. You must come up
to the nursery with me.

736
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:45,185
- What?
- Nanny is dangerously ill.

737
00:53:45,896 --> 00:53:47,227
Oh, you're crazy.

738
00:53:47,398 --> 00:53:50,799
Oh, Mrs. Ritchey, I wouldn't come here
if it wasn't absolutely necessary.

739
00:53:50,968 --> 00:53:54,335
Don't you understand?
Nanny is almost dying.

740
00:53:54,505 --> 00:53:58,100
- It's my duty to make you come.
- Ridiculous.

741
00:53:58,275 --> 00:54:02,143
Dr. Ranger is a grand...

742
00:54:02,313 --> 00:54:05,305
splendid, magnificent doctor.

743
00:54:05,483 --> 00:54:10,011
He's a magnificent doctor.
Says she's almost well.

744
00:54:10,187 --> 00:54:11,779
Don't be silly.

745
00:54:11,956 --> 00:54:14,424
Dr. Ranger hasn't been near her
for two days.

746
00:54:14,592 --> 00:54:17,959
She's sinking very low.
You've got to come with me.

747
00:54:18,129 --> 00:54:19,562
Shh.

748
00:54:19,730 --> 00:54:25,293
Utter confidence in Dr. Ranger.
He's a magnificent doctor.

749
00:54:25,469 --> 00:54:28,632
A marvelous doctor.

750
00:54:28,806 --> 00:54:32,264
Says you're an alarmist, an alarmist.

751
00:54:38,516 --> 00:54:40,746
He says that I can't see the children...

752
00:54:40,918 --> 00:54:46,117
because it makes them so nervous
and so upset.

753
00:54:46,290 --> 00:54:49,885
Oh, don't you understand?
Nanny is dying.

754
00:54:50,060 --> 00:54:55,430
Oh, go back of the bar
and give Tishy a little drink.

755
00:54:56,500 --> 00:55:02,905
- Mack, give Tishy a little drink.
- Who says I am?

756
00:55:06,477 --> 00:55:10,914
Oh, hello. I remember you.

757
00:55:11,248 --> 00:55:12,806
What are you waving at?

758
00:55:12,983 --> 00:55:15,417
You get out of here. He's mine.

759
00:55:15,586 --> 00:55:17,451
You get out of here.

760
00:55:17,621 --> 00:55:21,785
Dr. Ranger's a stupendous doctor.

761
00:55:21,959 --> 00:55:25,622
And I love my big boy.

762
00:55:28,332 --> 00:55:31,824
Don't stand there staring at me like that.

763
00:55:32,269 --> 00:55:35,466
I'm a dipsomaniac and I'm proud of it.

764
00:55:35,639 --> 00:55:39,097
You hear?
I'm a dipsomaniac and I like it.

765
00:55:39,276 --> 00:55:42,507
- I like it. How do you like that?
- You're a cruel, inhuman mother.

766
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:43,908
I'm a dipsomaniac...

767
00:55:44,081 --> 00:55:45,946
You're a rotten parasite, that's what.

768
00:55:46,116 --> 00:55:48,050
Don't blame it on the booze. It's you.

769
00:55:48,219 --> 00:55:51,518
Why do poor little children
have to be born to women like you?

770
00:55:51,689 --> 00:55:53,418
- How can I...?
- Shut up!

771
00:55:53,591 --> 00:55:55,354
Mack, don't let her hurt my feelings...

772
00:55:55,526 --> 00:55:59,018
You're going up in that nursery
if I have to drag you by the hair.

773
00:55:59,196 --> 00:56:01,994
Let go! Mack, stop her.

774
00:56:02,166 --> 00:56:05,567
Here, here, here. Just a minute, now.

775
00:56:05,736 --> 00:56:10,196
Don't you realize that
you're getting poor little miss all upset?

776
00:56:10,374 --> 00:56:12,239
Oh, yeah?

777
00:56:17,881 --> 00:56:19,178
Say, you can't...

778
00:56:28,692 --> 00:56:30,660
- Come on, now.
- Stop it, let go of me.

779
00:56:30,828 --> 00:56:35,492
- I say stop it. Stop.
- Oh, snap out of it.

780
00:56:35,866 --> 00:56:39,358
- Stay on your feet.
- Let me alone.

781
00:56:44,208 --> 00:56:46,335
You mother.

782
00:56:58,389 --> 00:57:00,186
Say, you can't do that.

783
00:57:12,036 --> 00:57:13,867
Bye-bye.

784
00:57:21,412 --> 00:57:23,937
Grand 2311.

785
00:57:24,815 --> 00:57:27,215
Hello, is Dr. Bell there?

786
00:57:28,152 --> 00:57:33,215
Oh. Well, do you know where I can
find him? I'm Lora Hart, a nurse.

787
00:57:33,390 --> 00:57:35,881
It's very important.

788
00:57:36,427 --> 00:57:38,987
Will he be at the hospital?

789
00:57:41,065 --> 00:57:44,398
When does he come in, tell him
Miss Hart wants him to come at once.

790
00:57:44,568 --> 00:57:48,971
Tell him it's vital, because I can't
find Dr. Ranger. Thank you.

791
00:57:54,545 --> 00:57:56,513
Hey, sister, where can I find Nick?

792
00:58:00,417 --> 00:58:02,112
Hello.

793
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,182
- Where'd you come from?
- I'm delivering.

794
00:58:07,324 --> 00:58:08,916
I thought you quit.

795
00:58:09,526 --> 00:58:13,622
Oh, well, I guess I kind of exaggerated.

796
00:58:14,465 --> 00:58:17,992
- Say, are you working here?
- Yes.

797
00:58:19,036 --> 00:58:21,664
And one of my little patients is dying.

798
00:58:23,307 --> 00:58:25,468
Say, you might help me.

799
00:58:25,642 --> 00:58:27,803
- Well, if I can do anything...
- Come with me.

800
00:58:27,978 --> 00:58:30,970
Say, is this the dump
you got the crack on the chin?

801
00:58:31,148 --> 00:58:34,515
- That doesn't matter now.
- Was Nick the guy?

802
00:58:35,185 --> 00:58:38,245
I've got to think of this little child
and you've got to help me.

803
00:58:38,422 --> 00:58:39,787
Okay, sister.

804
00:58:39,957 --> 00:58:41,151
Dr. Bell wasn't in.

805
00:58:41,325 --> 00:58:45,318
- Oh, what'll we do? What can we do?
- Just wait for Dr. Bell, that's all.

806
00:58:45,496 --> 00:58:48,192
No use sending for an ambulance,
Nanny couldn't be moved.

807
00:58:48,365 --> 00:58:50,856
- Say, who is this Bell guy?
Arthur Bell, the surgeon.

808
00:58:51,034 --> 00:58:53,195
Maybe I can find him.
I know a couple of guys...

809
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:55,304
How could you find him? Nobody can.

810
00:58:55,472 --> 00:58:58,737
I wish for once you'd stop acting
as though you knew everything.

811
00:58:59,176 --> 00:59:02,543
- Can't we try a milk bath?
Oh, that wouldn't do any good.

812
00:59:02,713 --> 00:59:05,147
That's what saved my sister's baby.

813
00:59:05,783 --> 00:59:08,843
- It's a crazy idea, but we'll try anything.
Oh, thank God.

814
00:59:09,019 --> 00:59:13,388
But I'll need milk.
Ten, 12, 15 quarts of it.

815
00:59:13,557 --> 00:59:14,581
Can you get it?

816
00:59:15,092 --> 00:59:18,584
- Why, where do you buy milk?
In a grocery, a delicatessen.

817
00:59:18,762 --> 00:59:21,094
- Oh, I get you.
Now, hurry, bootlegger.

818
00:59:21,265 --> 00:59:23,358
This has gotta be
the fastest delivery ever.

819
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:26,662
Okay, sister. I know a couple of guys...

820
01:00:31,034 --> 01:00:32,058
Bootlegger.

821
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:34,328
Come in here, will you?

822
01:00:42,112 --> 01:00:43,511
Where are you?

823
01:00:47,951 --> 01:00:51,478
Where's he gone?
Where's our bootlegger?

824
01:00:51,655 --> 01:00:56,149
He left 10 minutes ago. He won't be back.

825
01:00:56,326 --> 01:00:58,920
That's what's wrong with Prohibition.

826
01:00:59,563 --> 01:01:02,589
Oh, I wish I could find
one of those doctors.

827
01:01:04,234 --> 01:01:07,670
Don't get Ranger. I don't like him.

828
01:01:09,273 --> 01:01:11,673
- You don't?
- No more.

829
01:01:11,842 --> 01:01:16,870
- Why not?
- Had my suspicions confirmed.

830
01:01:18,348 --> 01:01:20,441
What suspicions?

831
01:01:21,051 --> 01:01:22,484
What suspicions?

832
01:01:24,021 --> 01:01:26,387
I heard, on the telephone...

833
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,492
What did you hear? Tell me.

834
01:01:30,127 --> 01:01:35,565
- I heard what I heard.
- Oh, talk to me.

835
01:01:35,732 --> 01:01:39,429
What did you hear? What about Ranger?

836
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,364
Not talking about him yet.

837
01:01:43,006 --> 01:01:46,134
- It isn't time.
- Oh, it is time, if it concerns those kids.

838
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:50,371
Will you talk to me?
It's about Nick, isn't it?

839
01:01:50,914 --> 01:01:54,406
I heard him talking to Dr. Ranger.

840
01:01:54,585 --> 01:01:57,213
All right, you heard him
talking to Dr. Ranger.

841
01:01:57,387 --> 01:01:59,821
- What did he say?
- To Dr. Ranger.

842
01:01:59,990 --> 01:02:05,360
Oh, will you pay attention to me?
What did Nick say to Dr. Ranger?

843
01:02:07,030 --> 01:02:11,023
Nick don't want people to see her
when she's drunk.

844
01:02:12,102 --> 01:02:16,402
- Judge will take away the trust fund.
- Trust fund?

845
01:02:16,573 --> 01:02:18,438
I had my suspicions.

846
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,635
Is Mrs. Ritchey in charge
of the children's trust fund?

847
01:02:21,812 --> 01:02:23,439
Mm-hm.

848
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:28,577
So that's what they're after.

849
01:02:33,757 --> 01:02:35,918
What's all the noise?

850
01:02:37,094 --> 01:02:41,793
Nick, you let us alone.
Nanny's terribly sick.

851
01:02:41,965 --> 01:02:43,956
Ah, shut up.

852
01:02:45,902 --> 01:02:47,733
What are you up to with that kid?

853
01:02:47,904 --> 01:02:50,566
I'm keeping her resting easily
until a doctor comes.

854
01:02:50,741 --> 01:02:53,972
- Have you anything to say about that?
- Depends on how you're doing it.

855
01:02:54,144 --> 01:02:57,011
- I'm giving her a milk bath.
- Dr. Ranger tell you to?

856
01:02:57,180 --> 01:03:01,549
No, I can't find Dr. Ranger.
Strange, isn't it?

857
01:03:02,386 --> 01:03:04,183
Nothing's gonna be done
without orders.

858
01:03:04,354 --> 01:03:07,915
Then you get Ranger here so we can
place the responsibility where it belongs.

859
01:03:08,091 --> 01:03:10,218
- I'm responsible when he ain't here.
- I'll say.

860
01:03:10,394 --> 01:03:14,194
- And I want Ranger's orders carried out.
- You'll be responsible for a lot more.

861
01:03:14,364 --> 01:03:15,729
Oh, yeah?

862
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:19,332
They use electric chairs
for the kind of things you're responsible for.

863
01:03:19,870 --> 01:03:21,997
Hey, just what's the idea
behind that crack?

864
01:03:22,172 --> 01:03:24,970
Don't you think I know
deliberate malpractice when I see it?

865
01:03:25,142 --> 01:03:28,634
- You're speaking right out, ain't you?
- Yeah, and I'll make it even plainer.

866
01:03:28,812 --> 01:03:31,076
In your case, I'm talking about murder.

867
01:03:31,248 --> 01:03:33,307
Why, you little...

868
01:03:35,452 --> 01:03:38,512
Keep your bean. If you don't like
what Ranger's doing, talk to him.

869
01:03:38,689 --> 01:03:42,090
- Don't bring me in.
You're in already, plenty.

870
01:03:42,259 --> 01:03:45,990
If this baby dies, you're in with Ranger.

871
01:03:46,697 --> 01:03:48,164
Spill it, now. Come on.

872
01:03:48,331 --> 01:03:50,765
How long did you think
you could get away with this?

873
01:03:50,934 --> 01:03:55,234
You think because you strong-arm women,
you have the brains to put this over?

874
01:03:55,405 --> 01:03:57,566
I had your number
the minute I stepped in.

875
01:03:57,741 --> 01:04:00,005
And I've reported my suspicions
on the outside.

876
01:04:00,177 --> 01:04:03,374
- Oh, yeah? Spit them out.
- You want those kids to die.

877
01:04:03,547 --> 01:04:05,606
- Yeah?
- You want what their father left them.

878
01:04:05,782 --> 01:04:08,774
That's why you keep the mother
full of booze all the time.

879
01:04:08,952 --> 01:04:11,978
You'll take her out and marry her
and grab the trust fund.

880
01:04:12,155 --> 01:04:16,717
- You're not gonna get away with it.
- Who said there was a trust fund?

881
01:04:24,868 --> 01:04:28,269
So you've been shooting off
your nutty ideas, huh?

882
01:04:28,438 --> 01:04:32,204
- Get out.
- Nick, you be careful, now.

883
01:04:32,375 --> 01:04:34,070
Get out!

884
01:04:38,248 --> 01:04:41,581
I'm not afraid of you anymore.

885
01:04:44,821 --> 01:04:46,448
No, Nick.

886
01:04:53,096 --> 01:04:56,725
- Now I'll tell you a few things.
- Beating me up won't get you any place.

887
01:05:14,284 --> 01:05:16,684
Poor little Nanny.

888
01:05:17,454 --> 01:05:20,651
Nobody cares whether you live or die.

889
01:05:21,725 --> 01:05:24,057
Gee, if you could only hear me.

890
01:05:24,828 --> 01:05:27,956
I can. And I'm certainly glad I'm here.

891
01:05:28,131 --> 01:05:32,329
- Doctor, you did get my message.
- No, I didn't get any message from you.

892
01:05:32,502 --> 01:05:35,403
But from a strange man,
a most extraordinary fellow.

893
01:05:35,572 --> 01:05:36,596
What man?

894
01:05:37,507 --> 01:05:39,998
He said if I couldn't
see my way clear getting here...

895
01:05:40,177 --> 01:05:44,079
he'd call around some evening with
a couple of friends and take me for a ride.

896
01:05:44,247 --> 01:05:48,013
- Did he say that?
- Yes, he did.

897
01:05:48,185 --> 01:05:51,279
And I didn't like
the way he said it, either.

898
01:05:51,755 --> 01:05:54,622
- Now, what's the trouble here?
- Oh, she's low, doctor.

899
01:05:54,791 --> 01:05:56,554
Very low.

900
01:06:01,598 --> 01:06:05,398
- Do you think there's anything we can do?
- Only one thing.

901
01:06:05,836 --> 01:06:08,100
- A blood transfusion, and in a hurry.
- Take mine.

902
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:10,739
I'm type 4A. I've been typed.

903
01:06:10,907 --> 01:06:13,535
- But we don't know the baby's type.
- I know it, it's 4A.

904
01:06:13,710 --> 01:06:15,507
Oh, doctor, we've got to hurry.

905
01:06:15,679 --> 01:06:16,941
Who's got to hurry?

906
01:06:19,583 --> 01:06:22,177
- Who are you?
- It's Nick, the chauffeur.

907
01:06:22,352 --> 01:06:24,047
Oh, yeah.

908
01:06:27,924 --> 01:06:28,982
I'm Dr. Bell.

909
01:06:29,159 --> 01:06:31,923
We're about to give a transfusion
and I ask you to keep out.

910
01:06:32,095 --> 01:06:34,256
You're not on this case.
You better get out.

911
01:06:34,431 --> 01:06:36,626
Now, listen,
this is a matter of life and death.

912
01:06:36,800 --> 01:06:40,634
- I'd run along if I was you.
- Oh, I can't be bothered with you... Oh!

913
01:06:40,804 --> 01:06:43,602
Oh, you dirty, lousy...

914
01:06:43,974 --> 01:06:45,498
Oh!

915
01:06:46,243 --> 01:06:48,234
Hey, you.

916
01:06:49,746 --> 01:06:53,705
Yeah, I mean you. Get out of here.

917
01:07:00,123 --> 01:07:02,683
Come on, and make it snappy.

918
01:07:32,289 --> 01:07:36,225
That's a good girl. Splendid.

919
01:07:37,994 --> 01:07:41,327
Oh, I... Did I wake you? I'm sorry.

920
01:07:41,498 --> 01:07:43,796
- How do you feel?
All right, I guess.

921
01:07:43,967 --> 01:07:48,461
- How's Nanny?
- She's responded beautifully.

922
01:07:49,839 --> 01:07:52,239
She'll pull out of it this time.

923
01:07:53,777 --> 01:07:57,770
- Hello, Nanny.
- Hello, Lora.

924
01:08:03,954 --> 01:08:06,787
Daylight. My goodness,
have I been asleep that long?

925
01:08:06,957 --> 01:08:09,824
Yes, and a good thing too.

926
01:08:10,126 --> 01:08:12,594
You better go right home
and go back to bed.

927
01:08:12,762 --> 01:08:15,390
Losing all that blood
can make you feel pretty miserable.

928
01:08:15,565 --> 01:08:18,159
I can't. I have to hurry and get dressed.

929
01:08:18,335 --> 01:08:20,929
- I'm going to the police station first.
Police?

930
01:08:21,104 --> 01:08:25,040
Can't you see?
I've got all the proof I need now.

931
01:08:26,009 --> 01:08:28,944
And I'm going to the bat for you.

932
01:08:29,112 --> 01:08:31,171
Gee, doctor, you're swell.

933
01:08:32,515 --> 01:08:35,814
No, just sleepy.

934
01:08:53,770 --> 01:08:55,362
Cuckoo.

935
01:08:55,538 --> 01:08:57,665
Oh. You.

936
01:08:57,841 --> 01:08:59,240
Ah, go on, let me in, will you?

937
01:08:59,409 --> 01:09:02,742
You know me, I've been here before.
Tony knows me too.

938
01:09:02,912 --> 01:09:05,506
- Hey, what are you trying to pull?
- Nothing.

939
01:09:05,682 --> 01:09:08,879
Only, you make any joint
look like a speakeasy.

940
01:09:10,253 --> 01:09:13,120
- Oh, Dr. Bell.
- Take good care of Nanny, Maloney.

941
01:09:13,289 --> 01:09:16,349
She's had a blood transfusion.
Keep in touch with me every hour.

942
01:09:16,526 --> 01:09:17,788
Well, how about Dr. Ranger?

943
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:21,897
I'm going to settle with him once and for all.
I'm going to engage a new night nurse.

944
01:09:22,065 --> 01:09:24,260
A night nurse?
What's the matter with you?

945
01:09:24,434 --> 01:09:27,369
Well, it's a certainty Mrs. Ritchey
will not want Lora around...

946
01:09:27,537 --> 01:09:29,835
after she learns what Lora
has decided to do.

947
01:09:30,407 --> 01:09:33,808
- Are you gonna sign a warrant?
- If it's the last thing I ever do.

948
01:09:33,977 --> 01:09:36,275
Don't be a fool.
You'll never get another job.

949
01:09:36,446 --> 01:09:40,041
One jam like this
and even the patients are leery of you.

950
01:09:42,382 --> 01:09:44,646
Will you give me a lift downtown?
I'm in a hurry.

951
01:09:44,817 --> 01:09:47,786
Give you a lift?
I've been waiting for the chance.

952
01:09:49,689 --> 01:09:51,156
Well, how about a date tonight?

953
01:09:51,324 --> 01:09:55,192
You're not much to look at, but you do have
a way of showing up when you're needed.

954
01:09:55,361 --> 01:09:57,727
- Come here.
- By the way, what's your name?

955
01:09:57,897 --> 01:09:59,159
- Mortie.
- Glad to meet you.

956
01:09:59,332 --> 01:10:01,960
- Mine's Lora Hart.
- It's the last name I like.

957
01:10:02,135 --> 01:10:04,103
You won't be able to drive with one arm.

958
01:10:04,270 --> 01:10:08,764
Sure I will. When I say shift, shift.

959
01:10:10,143 --> 01:10:11,667
Shift.

960
01:10:13,246 --> 01:10:16,079
Hey, stupe, look where you're going.

961
01:10:17,016 --> 01:10:18,984
Try again.

962
01:10:22,021 --> 01:10:23,648
- Happy?
- Uh-huh.

963
01:10:23,823 --> 01:10:25,620
- But there's one thing.
- What?

964
01:10:25,792 --> 01:10:29,250
I hate to think of Nick being arrested
and that dirt coming out in court...

965
01:10:29,429 --> 01:10:31,920
on account of those little kids.

966
01:10:42,842 --> 01:10:44,434
You know, I've just been thinking.

967
01:10:44,611 --> 01:10:46,738
- Maybe Nick won't be arrested.
- Why not?

968
01:10:46,913 --> 01:10:48,813
I ain't seen him around since last night.

969
01:10:48,982 --> 01:10:50,779
- Think he's run away?
- No.

970
01:10:50,950 --> 01:10:54,442
- Well, what do you think?
- I ain't got an idea.

971
01:10:54,621 --> 01:10:57,021
Only, I happened to be talking
to a couple of guys...

972
01:10:57,190 --> 01:10:59,522
- What difference does that make?
- Nothing.

973
01:10:59,692 --> 01:11:02,923
Only, I happened to mention
I didn't like Nick so good.

974
01:11:13,640 --> 01:11:16,700
- What is it, for us?
- Nope, for the morgue.

975
01:11:18,645 --> 01:11:21,011
Some guy got taken for a ride.

976
01:11:21,180 --> 01:11:22,545
Bootlegger?

977
01:11:22,715 --> 01:11:26,116
No, he was wearing
a chauffeur's uniform.

978
01:11:29,155 --> 01:11:30,713
Shift.
