1
00:02:38,179 --> 00:02:42,449
What's that, Mr. Howell?
I don't know, Billy.

2
00:02:44,351 --> 00:02:46,086
Let's find out.

3
00:02:48,722 --> 00:02:52,925
What do you make
of that cymbal, Malcolm?
I don't know, Howell.

4
00:02:52,993 --> 00:02:55,995
Does it mean anything
to you, Tal Chotali?

5
00:02:57,431 --> 00:02:59,565
The men of the hills
are gathering.

6
00:02:59,633 --> 00:03:02,668
The cymbal says that
the white men are to be driven...

7
00:03:02,736 --> 00:03:05,405
from the Valley of Tombs.
Lieutenant!

8
00:03:09,009 --> 00:03:11,243
Close the stockade gate.

9
00:03:11,312 --> 00:03:13,913
Man the machine guns.
Yes, sir.

10
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:17,450
Close those gates!
Take your places!
Man the gun!

11
00:03:25,191 --> 00:03:27,527
Come on.
Give me a hand.

12
00:03:27,594 --> 00:03:30,430
Take cover, Betty.
This may be serious.

13
00:04:28,455 --> 00:04:30,390
What causes this attack?

14
00:04:30,457 --> 00:04:32,458
The legend.

15
00:04:32,526 --> 00:04:37,262
No white man shall desecrate
the Valley of Tombs.

16
00:04:37,330 --> 00:04:40,200
That is not a true legend.

17
00:04:40,267 --> 00:04:43,168
When there is desecration,

18
00:04:43,236 --> 00:04:45,738
Scorpio will erupt.

19
00:04:45,806 --> 00:04:48,408
See for yourself.
There is no eruption.

20
00:04:48,475 --> 00:04:51,411
You have spilled blood
without reason.

21
00:04:52,413 --> 00:04:54,347
Return to your people,

22
00:04:54,415 --> 00:04:58,083
and counsel them to await
a sign from Scorpio.

23
00:04:58,151 --> 00:05:00,886
It shall be as you say.

24
00:05:00,954 --> 00:05:03,523
The true legend
must not be violated.

25
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:07,059
The white men must leave.
There is a curse which says...

26
00:05:07,127 --> 00:05:10,863
that any white man
that enters the Valley of Tombs
shall die.

27
00:05:10,931 --> 00:05:13,265
He's coming back.

28
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:16,736
It looks as if
Tal Chotali was successful.
I hope so.

29
00:05:23,043 --> 00:05:26,045
Is the attack over?
Who are they?
What do they want?

30
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:28,047
We'll not be attacked again...

31
00:05:28,114 --> 00:05:30,416
if we stop our work
in the tombs and depart.

32
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:33,185
But our visas and permits
are in order.

33
00:05:33,253 --> 00:05:36,956
The chief warns that
no permit will protect us from
the curse of the Scorpion...

34
00:05:37,024 --> 00:05:38,924
if we enter
the inner tomb.

35
00:05:38,992 --> 00:05:41,226
The only reason I financed
this expedition...

36
00:05:41,294 --> 00:05:43,429
was to examine the contents
of that tomb.

37
00:05:43,497 --> 00:05:47,132
Surely you're not gonna
be stopped by a native curse.
It's superstitious nonsense.

38
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,969
That's what everybody said about
the curse of King Tut's tomb.

39
00:05:50,036 --> 00:05:52,238
But a lot of them died.
We'll handle this, Billy.

40
00:05:52,306 --> 00:05:55,641
We'll open the tomb at once.
We strike camp in the morning...

41
00:05:55,709 --> 00:05:59,111
and be well on our way
before there is any further
danger from the natives.

42
00:05:59,179 --> 00:06:01,113
That suit you, Tal Chotali?

43
00:06:01,181 --> 00:06:04,284
I wish our danger
came only from the natives.

44
00:06:04,351 --> 00:06:06,852
You don't take this curse
of the Scorpion seriously?

45
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,323
Believe me, gentlemen,
there is a curse
of the Scorpion.

46
00:06:10,391 --> 00:06:12,592
Nonsense.
We'll be seeing ghosts next.

47
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,661
Let's get to work.

48
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,502
Will you and Carlyle get
these specimens back to camp?
We'll be glad too.

49
00:06:46,727 --> 00:06:49,128
Look out!

50
00:06:53,033 --> 00:06:55,735
Why, there's
an inscription here.

51
00:06:56,737 --> 00:06:59,305
Can you translate it,
Tal Chotali?

52
00:06:59,373 --> 00:07:02,174
Yes, I can translate it.

53
00:07:05,779 --> 00:07:08,648
It says,
"Let what reposes...

54
00:07:08,715 --> 00:07:11,183
"behind this stone...

55
00:07:11,252 --> 00:07:16,589
"remain hidden from
the eyes of mankind...

56
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:18,591
for all time."

57
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:22,061
Why, the secret
of the Scorpion dynasty
must lie beyond this wall.

58
00:07:22,128 --> 00:07:24,864
Perhaps it would be wise...

59
00:07:24,931 --> 00:07:27,600
not to learn
what that secret is.

60
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:29,702
That's ridiculous.

61
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,304
Well, I think
Mr. Tal Chotali is right.

62
00:07:32,372 --> 00:07:36,275
I feel as though I were
robbing a grave right now.
You afraid, Billy?

63
00:07:36,342 --> 00:07:39,646
No, sir.
I just don't wanna pry
into anybody's secrets.

64
00:07:39,713 --> 00:07:42,448
I'll go into these passages
and remove that pottery for you,

65
00:07:42,516 --> 00:07:44,450
but I don't want
any part of this.

66
00:07:44,518 --> 00:07:46,452
Very well.

67
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:54,026
Clearly Batson is
the wisest one among us.

68
00:07:56,362 --> 00:07:58,363
I think I shall
follow his example,

69
00:07:58,431 --> 00:08:01,200
if I may be excused.

70
00:08:01,268 --> 00:08:03,403
Just as you like.

71
00:08:16,850 --> 00:08:20,486
Look! The Scorpion!

72
00:08:20,554 --> 00:08:23,022
Why, it's not
a tomb at all.

73
00:08:34,568 --> 00:08:37,002
What on earth is it?
Well, that's hard to say.

74
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:39,505
Why, these are lenses
of a sort.

75
00:08:39,573 --> 00:08:42,675
They're probably
a fused quartz of some kind.
Well!

76
00:08:42,743 --> 00:08:45,010
If this is the dreaded secret
of the Scorpion Dynasty,

77
00:08:45,078 --> 00:08:47,880
it seems to be
quite harmless now.

78
00:08:50,851 --> 00:08:53,485
The sunlight seems to have
something to do with it.

79
00:08:53,553 --> 00:08:57,690
Why, these lenses
are adjustable.

80
00:08:57,758 --> 00:08:59,692
Here, bring them all
into focus.

81
00:09:59,453 --> 00:10:03,055
I am Shazam.

82
00:10:04,524 --> 00:10:08,060
- My name is—
- All is known to me.

83
00:10:08,128 --> 00:10:10,896
Your name is Billy Batson.

84
00:10:10,964 --> 00:10:13,899
You did not pry into
the secret of the Scorpion.

85
00:10:13,967 --> 00:10:16,736
That is why I am here.

86
00:10:16,803 --> 00:10:18,838
But where did you come from?

87
00:10:18,905 --> 00:10:21,173
Out of the past,
my son,

88
00:10:21,241 --> 00:10:25,545
down through the ages
to guard the secret
of the Scorpion.

89
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,847
You've been alive
all these years?

90
00:10:27,914 --> 00:10:30,816
What you call life
returned to me...

91
00:10:30,884 --> 00:10:32,852
when your friends violated...

92
00:10:32,919 --> 00:10:36,488
the tomb of the Scorpion.
Well, they meant no harm.

93
00:10:36,556 --> 00:10:39,792
Then they should've obeyed
the inscription on the tomb.

94
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:43,563
The harm has been done.
It is your duty...

95
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,731
to see that the curse
of the Scorpion...

96
00:10:45,799 --> 00:10:49,735
is not visited upon
innocent people.
My duty?

97
00:10:49,803 --> 00:10:52,972
Yes. So long as
the Golden Scorpion...

98
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,075
may fall into the hands
of selfish men,

99
00:10:56,142 --> 00:10:59,344
it is the duty
of Captain Marvel...

100
00:10:59,412 --> 00:11:01,447
to protect the innocent
from its evil use.

101
00:11:01,515 --> 00:11:03,616
But who is Captain Marvel?

102
00:11:03,684 --> 00:11:06,551
You are, my son.

103
00:11:06,619 --> 00:11:10,555
All that is necessary
is to repeat my name—

104
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:12,591
Shazam.

105
00:11:12,659 --> 00:11:14,626
By its repetition,

106
00:11:14,695 --> 00:11:16,829
you will become
Captain Marvel...

107
00:11:16,897 --> 00:11:21,567
and take on the virtues
you see recorded there.

108
00:11:23,837 --> 00:11:26,338
The wisdom of Solomon;

109
00:11:27,407 --> 00:11:30,375
the strength of Hercules;

110
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:32,612
the stamina of Atlas;

111
00:11:32,679 --> 00:11:36,015
the power of Zeus;

112
00:11:36,082 --> 00:11:39,552
the great courage
of Achilles;

113
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:42,822
and the speed
of Mercury.

114
00:11:42,889 --> 00:11:45,758
You must never
call upon this power...

115
00:11:45,826 --> 00:11:48,660
except in the service
of right.

116
00:11:48,729 --> 00:11:52,597
To do so would bring
the Scorpion's curse
upon your own head.

117
00:11:52,665 --> 00:11:55,267
And now, my son,

118
00:11:55,335 --> 00:11:59,772
repeat my name
and return to the rescue
of your friends.

119
00:12:01,675 --> 00:12:03,843
Shazam!

120
00:12:46,352 --> 00:12:48,353
Shazam!

121
00:13:04,537 --> 00:13:07,606
Oh, Mr. Malcolm.
Are you all right?

122
00:13:07,673 --> 00:13:11,076
Why, yes.
It was a concussion
from the explosion.

123
00:13:11,144 --> 00:13:14,479
What caused it?
Why, that device there.

124
00:13:18,218 --> 00:13:20,853
Quick, call the others!

125
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:24,624
We've got to get
Lang and Fisher up to camp.

126
00:13:24,691 --> 00:13:28,260
We'll bring the Scorpion.
Take care of
this scroll, Bentley.

127
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:35,367
It is said forth here that
a certain arrangement
of the lenses...

128
00:13:35,435 --> 00:13:39,571
will transmute any substance
placed in front
of the base lens...

129
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:41,607
to pure gold.

130
00:13:41,675 --> 00:13:44,209
That's impossible.
Sounds like rubbish to me.

131
00:13:44,277 --> 00:13:46,378
We can soon find out.

132
00:13:46,446 --> 00:13:48,613
Show us how to arrange
the lenses.

133
00:13:57,257 --> 00:14:00,325
Uh, Billy,
bring me several stones.

134
00:14:08,668 --> 00:14:11,336
Uh, place them
on the ground.

135
00:14:19,813 --> 00:14:22,448
Um, step back, please.

136
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:36,095
Why, it is gold!
The purest I've ever seen.

137
00:14:36,162 --> 00:14:38,497
Only the sun's rays
is needed to create it.

138
00:14:38,564 --> 00:14:40,499
If we only knew the formula
for making those lenses.

139
00:14:40,566 --> 00:14:42,968
What difference does that make?
We've got these.

140
00:14:43,036 --> 00:14:45,070
Gentlemen, do you realize
that this Golden Scorpion...

141
00:14:45,138 --> 00:14:47,639
makes us the richest
and most powerful group
in the world?

142
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,641
Too rich and too powerful.

143
00:14:49,710 --> 00:14:52,244
Are you suggesting that
we destroy the Scorpion?

144
00:14:52,312 --> 00:14:54,246
Think of
its scientific value.

145
00:14:54,314 --> 00:14:58,283
- I am thinking of that.
- What do you propose?

146
00:14:58,351 --> 00:15:00,885
That the lenses be
distributed among us.

147
00:15:00,953 --> 00:15:02,988
And another take
the Scorpion itself.

148
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:06,291
And in that way,
the device could never be used
without the consent of all.

149
00:15:06,359 --> 00:15:09,761
Well, what about the scroll?
The Scorpion is useless
without it.

150
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:13,032
I suggest that Billy Batson
be entrusted with the scroll.
But he's so young, Howell.

151
00:15:13,099 --> 00:15:16,335
And this is of
such vast importance.

152
00:15:16,402 --> 00:15:19,238
Nevertheless,
Billy is probably
the only one among us...

153
00:15:19,305 --> 00:15:22,107
who can't translate it.
Ah, but Mr. Howell, I—

154
00:15:22,175 --> 00:15:24,343
I think Mr. Howell's plan
is excellent.

155
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:28,347
Tal Chotali,
will you disassemble
the lenses, please?

156
00:15:36,589 --> 00:15:38,657
Professor Fisher.

157
00:15:40,693 --> 00:15:42,694
Mr. Carlyle.

158
00:15:45,731 --> 00:15:47,732
Professor Bentley.

159
00:15:48,934 --> 00:15:53,572
Dr. Lang.
Mr. Malcolm.

160
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,608
And, Billy,
this is for you to guard.

161
00:15:56,676 --> 00:15:58,843
See that you guard it well.

162
00:15:58,911 --> 00:16:01,346
It contains a precious...

163
00:16:01,414 --> 00:16:03,648
and a dangerous secret.

164
00:16:03,716 --> 00:16:06,318
Don't worry, Tal Chotali.
I'll guard it.

165
00:16:06,686 --> 00:16:08,954
Well said, young fellow.
I'm sure you will.

166
00:16:09,022 --> 00:16:11,723
See that
your personal belongings
are packed tonight.

167
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,059
We start to load
at 4:00 in the morning...

168
00:16:14,127 --> 00:16:16,896
and start for
the base camp at daylight.

169
00:16:41,288 --> 00:16:43,888
It's the signal.

170
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:49,128
Thank you, sir.

171
00:16:49,195 --> 00:16:51,496
There's evil
in the air tonight.

172
00:16:51,564 --> 00:16:54,299
Yes, sir. You know,
I feel the same way.

173
00:17:51,191 --> 00:17:54,092
We all seem
restless tonight.

174
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,094
And for good reason.

175
00:18:30,430 --> 00:18:34,333
Good night.
Good night, Mr. Howell.

176
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:40,339
One who invites the curse
of the Golden Scorpion...

177
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:43,042
does well
to protect himself.

178
00:18:43,109 --> 00:18:46,378
Good night.
Good night, sir.

179
00:19:21,448 --> 00:19:23,715
Find the scroll.

180
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:33,725
Bring it, and return
to Rahman Bar.

181
00:19:41,167 --> 00:19:43,869
You men of the hills
know the legend.

182
00:19:45,938 --> 00:19:47,873
It is as old
as the rocks about you,

183
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,810
spewed up by Scorpio,
the guardian of
the Valley of Tombs.

184
00:19:51,878 --> 00:19:56,448
If the hands of alien whites
desecrate our holy places,

185
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,950
Scorpio will give
the sign to war.

186
00:20:04,957 --> 00:20:06,725
Scorpio!

187
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:12,196
- Scorpio has spoken!

188
00:21:02,748 --> 00:21:06,618
Yes?

189
00:21:06,686 --> 00:21:09,388
Yes, what is it?
Come here!

190
00:21:10,756 --> 00:21:12,757
Why, Billy!
What's up?

191
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,161
Mr. Howell's been murdered.
Howell, murdered?

192
00:21:16,229 --> 00:21:18,230
Yes, sir.

193
00:21:21,534 --> 00:21:23,768
Dissenters
with knives, sir.

194
00:21:23,836 --> 00:21:26,671
Round out your men.
Search the camp.
Yes, sir.

195
00:21:26,739 --> 00:21:28,673
Where is Howell?
In our tent.

196
00:21:28,741 --> 00:21:32,544
Radio the British troops
at Fort Mooltan. Tell them
we need immediate aid.

197
00:21:32,612 --> 00:21:34,613
Yes, sir.

198
00:21:41,754 --> 00:21:44,923
M.A.E. on 6-2-4,
calling Fort Mooltan.

199
00:21:44,990 --> 00:21:49,828
Malcolm Archaeological
Expedition on 6-2-4
calling Fort Mooltan.

200
00:21:49,895 --> 00:21:51,830
Fort Mooltan.
Come in, M.A.E.

201
00:21:51,897 --> 00:21:54,966
We need immediate aid.
We were attacked
by natives this afternoon,

202
00:21:55,034 --> 00:21:57,201
and two of our men
have been killed here tonight.

203
00:21:57,269 --> 00:21:59,838
Stand by, M.A.E.

204
00:22:01,674 --> 00:22:03,608
Yes, Sergeant?

205
00:22:03,676 --> 00:22:06,111
Trouble with that
Malcolm expedition
in the Valley of Tombs, sir.

206
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,113
They're standing by.
Ask their exact position,

207
00:22:08,181 --> 00:22:10,215
and tell them I'll send
a troop immediately.

208
00:22:10,283 --> 00:22:12,284
Orderly!

209
00:22:14,754 --> 00:22:17,255
Must have
your exact location.

210
00:22:56,563 --> 00:22:59,765
Colonel Hudson says the troops
are well on their way.
Thank you, Billy.

211
00:23:02,535 --> 00:23:05,103
One of my men reports
movement in the rocks, sir.

212
00:23:05,170 --> 00:23:07,105
Tell him to keep
a sharp lookout, Lieutenant.

213
00:23:24,424 --> 00:23:30,028
Do you honestly believe that
the volcano has anything
to do with the Scorpion?

214
00:23:30,095 --> 00:23:32,030
That's the legend.

215
00:23:32,097 --> 00:23:34,733
The natives will regard it
as a sign of war.

216
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,135
I don't believe there's a native
within 10 miles of here.

217
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:54,953
Look!

218
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:28,620
English troops are coming.
They've got a cannon.

219
00:24:32,224 --> 00:24:34,459
Take men across through
Kala and ambush them.

220
00:24:44,369 --> 00:24:46,805
Get me some ammunition!

221
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,347
Can't stand
much more of this.

222
00:24:57,817 --> 00:25:00,752
If we could only get
across the gorge.

223
00:25:02,488 --> 00:25:06,324
Get the others.
Yes, sir.

224
00:25:08,060 --> 00:25:10,061
Come on!

225
00:25:11,431 --> 00:25:14,332
What—
Get the cars ready.

226
00:25:16,502 --> 00:25:18,436
We'll try to get through
to the troops.

227
00:25:20,405 --> 00:25:22,406
Come on!

228
00:25:33,619 --> 00:25:35,253
Halt!

229
00:25:37,757 --> 00:25:39,591
Deploy!

230
00:25:57,309 --> 00:26:00,411
Get behind the baggage, Betty.
It'll protect you
from the gunfire.

231
00:26:00,479 --> 00:26:03,048
What about you, Billy?
I'll be all right.

232
00:26:17,329 --> 00:26:19,464
They will try
to cross the gorge.

233
00:26:19,532 --> 00:26:21,466
Send men ahead of them
and dynamite the bridge.

234
00:26:21,534 --> 00:26:24,335
You'll have to hurry.

235
00:26:33,746 --> 00:26:35,747
Shazam!

236
00:29:19,478 --> 00:29:22,513
Back up, Whitey!
Back up!

237
00:29:24,516 --> 00:29:27,318
Back up, Whitey!
Back up!
