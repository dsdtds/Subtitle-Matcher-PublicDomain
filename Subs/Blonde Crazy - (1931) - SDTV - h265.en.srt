1
00:00:04,813 --> 00:00:08,413
Who cares
for starlit skies?

2
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,780
when you're alone

3
00:00:11,847 --> 00:00:15,313
the magic moonlight dies

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:18,713
at the break of dawn

5
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,647
there is no sunlight

6
00:00:22,713 --> 00:00:29,080
when your lover has gone

7
00:00:29,147 --> 00:00:32,680
what lonely hours

8
00:00:32,747 --> 00:00:34,380
the evening

9
00:00:56,793 --> 00:00:59,160
Uh, show this young lady
to the housekeeper's room,

10
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:01,726
although I think
the position's been filled.

11
00:01:03,632 --> 00:01:05,732
Step this way, please.

12
00:01:10,166 --> 00:01:13,166
I came to get the linen job.
I hope the clerk is wrong.

13
00:01:13,182 --> 00:01:15,016
You ever see a hotel clerk
that was right?

14
00:01:15,082 --> 00:01:17,682
Hotel clerks
and house detectives.

15
00:01:30,155 --> 00:01:32,088
Now, what do you want?

16
00:01:32,155 --> 00:01:34,089
Just a smile.

17
00:01:34,156 --> 00:01:36,423
Come on, let's have it.

18
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:40,056
- That a baby.
- Scamp.

19
00:01:40,173 --> 00:01:43,273
Mrs. Snyder, the girl you hired
for the linen job is here.

20
00:01:43,274 --> 00:01:45,773
I told her to report
tomorrow morning.

21
00:01:46,139 --> 00:01:49,406
She wants to get acquainted
with the job on her own time.

22
00:01:50,473 --> 00:01:53,712
Well, I never met
one like that before.

23
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,312
Uh, miss Jones,

24
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,545
this is Mrs. Snyder, whom you talked
to over the phone this morning.

25
00:02:00,112 --> 00:02:02,079
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

26
00:02:02,195 --> 00:02:05,462
So you're
the ambitious kind, huh?

27
00:02:05,529 --> 00:02:07,362
Ever done
hotel work before?

28
00:02:07,429 --> 00:02:11,495
Sure. The Julian Dubuque,
the Blackstone in Chicago...

29
00:02:11,562 --> 00:02:13,831
How do you know so much
about where she worked?

30
00:02:13,862 --> 00:02:18,101
Why, uh, Jimmie, her...
Her boyfriend told me.

31
00:02:18,168 --> 00:02:20,068
Oh, I see.

32
00:02:20,135 --> 00:02:23,035
Well, uh, you won't
need me anymore...

33
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,235
right now.

34
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,601
I'll be seeing you.

35
00:02:35,919 --> 00:02:39,386
Call for a Mr. Franklin!

36
00:02:39,802 --> 00:02:42,237
Say, that dame's a pip.
Who is she?

37
00:02:42,308 --> 00:02:44,242
Call for a Mr. Franklin!

38
00:02:44,308 --> 00:02:46,075
Listen, Jim,

39
00:02:46,142 --> 00:02:48,875
your girlfriend got
the linen job, didn't she?

40
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:50,875
Yeah. What about it?

41
00:02:50,942 --> 00:02:53,875
Well, uh, I hear
she can't come to work.

42
00:02:54,092 --> 00:02:56,758
No? Why not?

43
00:02:56,825 --> 00:02:58,892
Somebody else got
the linen job instead.

44
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,258
What do you mean?
Mamie was hired.

45
00:03:01,325 --> 00:03:02,924
Yeah, I know, but...

46
00:03:02,925 --> 00:03:05,758
they needed somebody
with more experience.

47
00:03:05,825 --> 00:03:08,064
Well, I'm going upstairs
and see old lady Snyder.

48
00:03:08,065 --> 00:03:10,564
She's not going to get away
with that stuff.

49
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:12,564
This new girl
needs the work.

50
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:13,664
So does Mamie.

51
00:03:13,731 --> 00:03:15,464
I'm going up there
and raise a...

52
00:03:15,465 --> 00:03:18,064
Wait a minute.

53
00:03:21,998 --> 00:03:22,898
Here.

54
00:03:24,864 --> 00:03:28,531
Just tell Mamie that one
of the old girls came back.

55
00:03:28,598 --> 00:03:30,731
You can do it.

56
00:03:36,104 --> 00:03:37,036
Did you get it?

57
00:03:37,037 --> 00:03:38,971
All set, I guess
if I want the job.

58
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:40,570
What do you mean,
if you want it?

59
00:03:40,571 --> 00:03:43,505
I don't want any job bad enough
to take away from somebody else.

60
00:03:43,506 --> 00:03:45,938
Whenever you take a job,
you take it away from somebody.

61
00:03:45,939 --> 00:03:48,639
- There are more people the jobs in the world.
- Well, it's all over my head.

62
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:51,238
This miss Jones business
and somebody's sweetie.

63
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:56,871
- What's your name?
- Anne Roberts.

64
00:03:56,872 --> 00:03:58,678
Listen, Anne,

65
00:03:58,679 --> 00:04:00,979
the girl that got the job is a
friend of one of the bellhops.

66
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:03,411
- Everything's fixed.
- What do you mean, fixed?

67
00:04:03,412 --> 00:04:05,579
She didn't want the job
very bad anyhow.

68
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:08,013
They're going to get married
in a couple of weeks.

69
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:11,344
- When are you coming to work?
- In the morning.

70
00:04:11,345 --> 00:04:13,777
- Got your aprons?
- No, but I'm going to buy a couple.

71
00:04:13,778 --> 00:04:16,911
Don't. I'll get them for you.
Won't cost you a cent.

72
00:04:16,912 --> 00:04:17,945
Thanks...

73
00:04:17,946 --> 00:04:19,779
- Bert.
- Bert?

74
00:04:21,211 --> 00:04:22,883
Call me Albert for short.

75
00:04:24,017 --> 00:04:25,583
Goodbye...

76
00:04:26,184 --> 00:04:27,584
Bertie.

77
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,218
And let me tell you
something about this place.

78
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:44,218
I've been here six months,
and I know.

79
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:46,484
For the love of Mike,

80
00:04:46,551 --> 00:04:49,224
Stay away
from those bellhops.

81
00:04:49,257 --> 00:04:51,457
They can't do a girlie
any good,

82
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:53,357
And the worst monkey
of them all

83
00:04:53,424 --> 00:04:55,357
Is that guy Bert Harris.

84
00:04:55,424 --> 00:04:56,724
He's dynamite.

85
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,724
Everybody in this joint
owes him money

86
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:00,724
From those crooked dice
of his.

87
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,790
Well, he can't
do me any harm.

88
00:05:02,857 --> 00:05:05,790
I haven't any money,
and I don't shoot craps.

89
00:05:05,857 --> 00:05:07,090
Oh, yeah?

90
00:05:07,224 --> 00:05:09,890
Well, maybe you have
something else he can use.

91
00:05:09,957 --> 00:05:10,990
I'm telling you

92
00:05:11,057 --> 00:05:13,030
He's a good guy
to stay away from.

93
00:05:13,096 --> 00:05:15,030
He peddles booze and...

94
00:05:18,596 --> 00:05:22,730
Hello?
Yes, sir, right away.

95
00:05:22,796 --> 00:05:24,763
610 wants
some fresh towels.

96
00:05:24,830 --> 00:05:27,563
610? I thought they
were painting up there.

97
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:29,563
I guess they're finished.

98
00:05:41,236 --> 00:05:42,636
Oh, it's you.

99
00:05:42,702 --> 00:05:45,070
Mm-hmm, body and soul.

100
00:05:58,037 --> 00:05:59,970
I never did like
bright lights.

101
00:06:11,609 --> 00:06:14,243
Look, honey, I got some
hooch and sandwiches

102
00:06:14,276 --> 00:06:17,309
And stuff for us.

103
00:06:17,376 --> 00:06:19,309
It's nice and quiet here.

104
00:06:22,376 --> 00:06:24,309
Not a chance
of anybody finding us.

105
00:06:27,615 --> 00:06:28,682
I knew you'd come.

106
00:06:37,782 --> 00:06:39,749
That's a fine way
to treat a fellow

107
00:06:39,815 --> 00:06:41,749
After he gets you
your job.

108
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,922
Hello.
Give me the linen room.

109
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:54,256
Hello, Peggy?

110
00:06:54,322 --> 00:06:56,289
How about giving
little Bertie a big break?

111
00:06:56,356 --> 00:06:57,556
I'm up in 610.

112
00:06:57,622 --> 00:06:59,889
You mean you want me
to come right up?

113
00:06:59,956 --> 00:07:02,056
Sure. I'm waiting for you,
honey.

114
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:04,056
Everything's all set.
Can you come up?

115
00:07:04,122 --> 00:07:08,522
Sure can.
I'll fly up, big boy.

116
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:14,122
Come in.

117
00:07:14,256 --> 00:07:15,622
Good evening.

118
00:07:15,689 --> 00:07:18,295
Hello.

119
00:07:18,362 --> 00:07:20,295
- Kind of hot tonight.
- Too hot.

120
00:07:20,362 --> 00:07:22,862
Shall I do your bed?
Kind of early, isn't it?

121
00:07:22,928 --> 00:07:24,862
Not if you're
going to bed.

122
00:07:24,928 --> 00:07:29,128
A bed doesn't mean much
to a fellow like me.

123
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,128
Just a place
to rest my head.

124
00:07:31,262 --> 00:07:33,262
What a treat for the bed.

125
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:37,562
Yeah. Say, how about
a little nip together,

126
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:40,528
Just you and me, huh?

127
00:07:40,595 --> 00:07:43,568
Why just you and me?
How about your other friend,

128
00:07:43,634 --> 00:07:47,168
The little fellow over there
in the green sweater?

129
00:07:55,735 --> 00:07:58,669
Hello! Give me
the housekeeper.

130
00:07:58,735 --> 00:08:00,669
This is
a. Rupert Johnson Jr.,

131
00:08:00,735 --> 00:08:02,502
Room 334.

132
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:04,435
Need more towels at once,

133
00:08:04,502 --> 00:08:06,602
And send that same girl
back here.

134
00:08:06,669 --> 00:08:09,275
Send the bellboy up
with ginger ale and ice.

135
00:08:14,741 --> 00:08:16,708
I heard you yelling
clear down the corridor.

136
00:08:16,775 --> 00:08:17,875
Here are your towels.

137
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:20,175
What makes you so hard
to get along with?

138
00:08:20,275 --> 00:08:22,041
Mugs like you.

139
00:08:22,108 --> 00:08:24,341
I can be real nice
to the right one.

140
00:08:24,408 --> 00:08:26,341
Really? And I suppose
the right one's

141
00:08:26,408 --> 00:08:27,875
The first one
that comes along.

142
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:29,908
You know, I'm mighty
lonesome myself,

143
00:08:29,975 --> 00:08:32,108
And you impress me
as being lonesome, too.

144
00:08:32,175 --> 00:08:34,114
Yeah? Well, you got
the wrong impression.

145
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:36,114
Well, let's be friends
anyway.

146
00:08:36,181 --> 00:08:38,114
Say, will you
do me a favor?

147
00:08:38,181 --> 00:08:39,281
Perhaps.

148
00:08:39,314 --> 00:08:40,881
I've got a new line
of merchandise.

149
00:08:40,882 --> 00:08:42,915
I'd like to see
what you think of it.

150
00:08:42,916 --> 00:08:44,849
Come on. Look at it.

151
00:08:45,414 --> 00:08:48,747
A woman is always a better judge
of jewelry than a man is,

152
00:08:49,881 --> 00:08:52,282
especially a pretty woman.

153
00:08:56,165 --> 00:08:57,837
Ah!

154
00:08:57,838 --> 00:08:59,738
Here's a dandy.

155
00:08:59,804 --> 00:09:02,804
Here, let's see
how this looks on you.

156
00:09:05,738 --> 00:09:10,604
These look mighty nice
on you.

157
00:09:10,671 --> 00:09:14,604
You know, they just
match your teeth.

158
00:09:14,671 --> 00:09:17,038
Gee, you look swell.

159
00:09:17,104 --> 00:09:18,504
Hey, cut that out!

160
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:21,404
Oh! Oh! Now look
what you did!

161
00:09:21,471 --> 00:09:23,410
Those are expensive.

162
00:09:25,444 --> 00:09:27,644
Ohh! Ohh!

163
00:09:33,644 --> 00:09:34,944
Hiya, Mrs. Dempsey.

164
00:09:35,044 --> 00:09:36,944
How's that
right cross today?

165
00:09:37,044 --> 00:09:39,644
Aw, come on, honey, don't
put on the chill that way.

166
00:09:39,645 --> 00:09:42,112
I sized you up wrong
yesterday.

167
00:09:42,113 --> 00:09:44,047
I didn't mean
to get you sore.

168
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:46,794
I like you, Anne, really.

169
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,800
You know, you're the first girl that
ever socked me for going for her.

170
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:51,701
- Yes?
- Mm-hmm.

171
00:09:52,866 --> 00:09:54,301
You know, honey,

172
00:09:54,367 --> 00:09:57,467
I'd like to have you
sock me like that every day.

173
00:09:57,534 --> 00:09:58,467
Oh, would you?

174
00:09:58,534 --> 00:10:01,301
Sure, honey, I'd love it.

175
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:10,901
Ha ha.

176
00:10:10,967 --> 00:10:12,907
What a woman.

177
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:23,907
Took you long enough
to get here, kid.

178
00:10:23,973 --> 00:10:26,473
I had to pick out
the big chunks of ice.

179
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:28,540
Yeah?

180
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:35,473
Say...

181
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,446
What's the name of that
blonde making up the beds?

182
00:10:39,513 --> 00:10:40,946
I don't know her
that well, sir.

183
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:43,447
I didn't think you did.
You don't look too smart.

184
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,413
Everybody says I'm very bright
for my age, sir.

185
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,413
I can't get anywhere
talking to you.

186
00:10:49,246 --> 00:10:50,946
Maybe you'd be surprised.

187
00:10:52,113 --> 00:10:54,046
What's that?

188
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,320
Have a drink?

189
00:11:05,386 --> 00:11:07,620
Never touch the stuff
while I'm on the job.

190
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:09,853
Besides, I never drink
anything but my own.

191
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,986
Here, you might try this.

192
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,420
Not bad.

193
00:11:22,186 --> 00:11:23,520
Say, that's pretty good.

194
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:24,553
That's what everybody says.

195
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:28,553
That chambermaid you asked about likes
it so well she won't touch any other.

196
00:11:28,926 --> 00:11:31,192
She's my best customer.

197
00:11:31,359 --> 00:11:32,292
Yeah?

198
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:33,826
Mm-hmm.

199
00:11:35,192 --> 00:11:36,759
You sell that stuff?

200
00:11:36,826 --> 00:11:39,126
Can't afford
to make a gift of it.

201
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:41,126
- How much?
- $10.

202
00:11:41,192 --> 00:11:43,126
That's high, isn't it?

203
00:11:44,859 --> 00:11:47,592
Not if the blond chambermaid
likes it.

204
00:11:56,598 --> 00:11:58,866
The name's Bert.

205
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:12,433
Hello, babe.

206
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,433
Hello.

207
00:12:13,499 --> 00:12:15,433
I've got something
for you.

208
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:17,035
Here's the 5 bucks
I owe you.

209
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:18,972
For what? You don't
owe me anything,

210
00:12:19,305 --> 00:12:21,339
unless it's an apology
for bothering me.

211
00:12:21,405 --> 00:12:25,239
No, take it! It's a commission on
the booze I sold that mug in 334.

212
00:12:25,339 --> 00:12:27,805
He bought it when I told him
you liked it.

213
00:12:27,872 --> 00:12:29,805
After all I told you,

214
00:12:29,872 --> 00:12:32,172
You went and fell
for this shrimp's line,

215
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:35,339
You dirty little tramp.

216
00:12:49,445 --> 00:12:51,611
It hurts...

217
00:12:51,678 --> 00:12:55,611
It hurts me more
than it does you, honey.

218
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:58,978
"Answers advertisement,

219
00:12:59,045 --> 00:13:02,479
"invests $25,000,
charges fraud.

220
00:13:02,546 --> 00:13:04,479
"'Get rich quick' scheme
works again.

221
00:13:05,712 --> 00:13:09,052
Prince of swindlers
makes gigantic haul."

222
00:13:09,118 --> 00:13:10,351
Say, what is this,

223
00:13:10,352 --> 00:13:12,585
taking a correspondence course
in salesmanship?

224
00:13:13,152 --> 00:13:14,652
Nothing else.

225
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:16,652
Super-high pressure
and deluxe.

226
00:13:16,718 --> 00:13:17,885
Going on the road?

227
00:13:17,952 --> 00:13:22,485
Uh-huh. Won't be long now,
and I'll take you along.

228
00:13:22,552 --> 00:13:24,485
Not as a sideline,
you won't.

229
00:13:24,552 --> 00:13:27,818
Well, I think you and I can make
a lot of money together.

230
00:13:27,885 --> 00:13:29,118
Then what?

231
00:13:29,185 --> 00:13:32,185
We blow this joint and make
a play for the big city.

232
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:34,224
You sound like Santa Claus
in wolf's clothing.

233
00:13:34,358 --> 00:13:37,758
Honey, I'm Santa Claus,
Robin hood,

234
00:13:37,824 --> 00:13:40,758
and the goose that laid
the golden egg all in one.

235
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:42,824
Pretty big package,
aren't you?

236
00:13:42,891 --> 00:13:45,424
Seriously, there's a lot
of loose money lying around

237
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:47,158
if you only know
where to look for it.

238
00:13:47,224 --> 00:13:50,724
The world owes me a living.
I'm not built for work.

239
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,658
That's for horses and smack-offs
like that 4-eyed room clerk.

240
00:13:54,058 --> 00:13:57,124
Now, you've got beauty
and a swell figure.

241
00:13:57,191 --> 00:14:01,364
With my ideas and your looks,
we could trim the world.

242
00:14:01,430 --> 00:14:03,364
And end up
in the penitentiary.

243
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,198
Not with what I have
on the ball.

244
00:14:05,265 --> 00:14:07,831
Now, listen, honey,
here's the idea.

245
00:14:07,898 --> 00:14:09,831
The age of chivalry
has passed.

246
00:14:09,898 --> 00:14:13,198
This, honey,
is the age of chiseler.

247
00:14:13,265 --> 00:14:16,465
And the age of jails.

248
00:14:16,531 --> 00:14:18,465
Everybody's got larceny
in his heart.

249
00:14:18,531 --> 00:14:20,465
Everybody's looking
for something for nothing.

250
00:14:20,531 --> 00:14:22,771
Honest men are scarcer
than feathers on a frog.

251
00:14:22,837 --> 00:14:27,504
Oh, I know Bert. I've never
been mixed up in a racket before.

252
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:32,304
As I said, there are two things I haven't
any use for, and jail is both of them.

253
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,371
You play ball with me, and your
worrying days will be over.

254
00:14:35,437 --> 00:14:39,037
Yeah?
How about the nights?

255
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,237
Well, I'll see what I can do
about those, too, honey.

256
00:14:49,743 --> 00:14:52,376
Sorry to disturb
your little party.

257
00:14:52,377 --> 00:14:55,110
Oh, we were just going,
so it's alright anyway.

258
00:14:55,177 --> 00:14:57,110
Not alright with me.

259
00:14:57,177 --> 00:14:58,977
Parking without lights
is pretty serious.

260
00:14:58,978 --> 00:15:01,478
A lot of accidents
these days.

261
00:15:01,810 --> 00:15:05,177
Oh, tell him to take that
horrid light out of my eyes.

262
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:07,545
The... the lady objects
to your flashlight.

263
00:15:07,611 --> 00:15:09,311
Oh, she does, does she?

264
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:11,918
Maybe she can't stand
close inspection.

265
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:14,419
I-I-I resent that.

266
00:15:14,617 --> 00:15:16,017
Alright, alright,

267
00:15:16,084 --> 00:15:18,050
Come on,
the both of you, get out.

268
00:15:24,717 --> 00:15:28,050
Now, look, here,
can't you and me get together?

269
00:15:28,117 --> 00:15:31,750
What do you mean,
get together?

270
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:37,823
What's this?

271
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:40,156
Aw, just forget
all about it.

272
00:15:40,223 --> 00:15:42,990
Go on,
get yourself a smoke.

273
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:46,690
Come on, lady,
you get out of there.

274
00:15:46,756 --> 00:15:47,723
Listen, partner...

275
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,490
There's nothing
to listen to.

276
00:15:50,556 --> 00:15:52,590
Oh, I see.

277
00:15:52,656 --> 00:15:54,890
This is a nice mess.

278
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:58,690
What's your husband going to say when
he finds out about this, Mrs. Lawler?

279
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:02,256
Oh, he's a friend
of my husband.

280
00:16:02,257 --> 00:16:04,129
Why, I didn't know
you were married.

281
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,996
Well, you know it now.

282
00:16:17,063 --> 00:16:18,630
Well, come on.

283
00:16:18,697 --> 00:16:20,397
No use standing here.

284
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:23,997
In the car
and we'll get going.

285
00:16:24,063 --> 00:16:25,630
Well, wh-where to?

286
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:27,130
Headquarters.

287
00:16:27,197 --> 00:16:28,402
I can't go there.

288
00:16:28,403 --> 00:16:30,402
Neither can I.
I've got a wife.

289
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:32,403
Why, I didn't know
you were married.

290
00:16:32,404 --> 00:16:34,402
Well, you know it now.

291
00:16:34,403 --> 00:16:38,836
Come on, snap into it.
I ain't got all night.

292
00:16:41,003 --> 00:16:44,403
Hiya, Mr. Johnson!

293
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:45,569
Speeding?

294
00:16:45,636 --> 00:16:47,569
No, parking.

295
00:16:54,109 --> 00:16:55,142
Hello, Pete.

296
00:16:55,143 --> 00:16:56,143
Hiya, kid.

297
00:16:56,144 --> 00:16:58,678
Mr. Johnson here
is a friend of mine.

298
00:16:58,679 --> 00:17:01,213
So's the young lady
a friend of his.

299
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:02,514
Who is it?

300
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:08,809
Why, it's Anne Lawler.

301
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:09,810
This is news.

302
00:17:09,942 --> 00:17:12,576
- What have you got them on?
- Plenty.

303
00:17:12,577 --> 00:17:14,577
Parking without lights
on a county highway,

304
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:16,544
possession and transportation
of liquor,

305
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:19,484
- bribing an officer of the law...
- That's a lie.

306
00:17:20,249 --> 00:17:24,082
Well, we won't stop to argue that.
Go on, get back in your car.

307
00:17:33,582 --> 00:17:35,416
It looks pretty bad,
Mr. Johnson.

308
00:17:35,417 --> 00:17:37,784
Hey, Bert,
can't you do something?

309
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:41,849
My name, my reputation,
the newspapers.

310
00:17:41,850 --> 00:17:43,089
I don't know.

311
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:45,023
This guy's a tough mug.

312
00:17:47,055 --> 00:17:50,122
Listen, I know this guy
pretty well.

313
00:17:50,923 --> 00:17:54,323
- You want me to see what I can do about him?
- Sure, and stop at nothing.

314
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,358
I'll be ruined
if this gets out.

315
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:00,122
Wait a minute.

316
00:18:27,395 --> 00:18:29,895
Hank certainly looked
like a real cop.

317
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:31,332
Why not?

318
00:18:31,399 --> 00:18:33,371
If he can't impersonate
John Law, nobody can.

319
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:36,371
He's been pinched
often enough.

320
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:38,371
Here you are, honey...

321
00:18:38,438 --> 00:18:41,471
$2,500 for you
and $2,500 for me,

322
00:18:41,538 --> 00:18:44,738
With the compliments
of room 334.

323
00:18:48,001 --> 00:18:48,968
What's the matter, baby?

324
00:18:49,735 --> 00:18:51,768
Come on,
snap out of it.

325
00:18:51,769 --> 00:18:54,202
We ought to be celebrating this touch.
Here you're acting like this.

326
00:18:54,203 --> 00:18:57,836
- Come on, pick up your end.
- I can't take the money, Bert. You keep it.

327
00:18:57,874 --> 00:18:59,907
Oh, no, no, take it.

328
00:18:59,908 --> 00:19:02,075
It's yours, partner.
50/50.

329
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,941
Well...

330
00:19:07,207 --> 00:19:08,374
I'm awfully tired.

331
00:19:08,441 --> 00:19:10,374
I think I'll turn in.

332
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:14,507
That's not a bad idea.

333
00:19:15,874 --> 00:19:18,908
Uh, you can sleep in the lower
and I'll take the upper.

334
00:19:18,975 --> 00:19:20,442
You don't mind,
do you?

335
00:19:21,008 --> 00:19:23,377
You see, I was in such a hurry
when I bought the tickets,

336
00:19:23,378 --> 00:19:24,880
I just got one compartment.

337
00:19:26,114 --> 00:19:29,114
I sort of figured you'd be in a hurry
when you bought the tickets, Bert,

338
00:19:29,248 --> 00:19:31,481
so I bought a berth
in the next car.

339
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:33,381
You don't mind, do you?

340
00:19:33,382 --> 00:19:35,448
I'm sure you'll
sleep better that way.

341
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:44,748
Oh, I mustn't go without letting you know
how much I care for you, Bert, dear.

342
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:01,487
And this, commissioner,
is our local larceny Lane,

343
00:20:01,554 --> 00:20:04,020
where money's made easily
and lost quickly.

344
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:07,820
Take a look at the house detective
giving us the once-over.

345
00:20:07,821 --> 00:20:09,987
You look, babe.
I haven't got my glasses.

346
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,854
Where did the horse
come in?

347
00:20:11,855 --> 00:20:14,328
Come in?
He's still running.

348
00:20:14,360 --> 00:20:16,660
I laughed
till I thought I'd die.

349
00:20:16,661 --> 00:20:18,661
I'd give a million
to have seen that chap's face.

350
00:20:18,693 --> 00:20:21,694
You should've seen his expression
when I told him I still had his letters.

351
00:20:21,695 --> 00:20:25,495
My motto is... speak
all languages and write none.

352
00:20:26,194 --> 00:20:28,961
Swell-dressed parade
of parasites, aren't they?

353
00:20:29,027 --> 00:20:32,361
Worse than all the gangsters
and hoodlums put together.

354
00:20:32,393 --> 00:20:35,627
Dream of Spanish castles

355
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:38,060
it smacks of real love

356
00:20:38,127 --> 00:20:39,793
a Spanish castle

357
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:45,260
I've got a rhyme
for a Spanish castle

358
00:20:45,367 --> 00:20:47,133
Better sit over here,
Bert.

359
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,567
You're blocking traffic.

360
00:20:48,613 --> 00:20:50,780
eyes of blue,

361
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:54,347
red lips, too,

362
00:20:57,533 --> 00:21:00,033
Anybody who doesn't like this
should have his head examined.

363
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:02,906
I'd like it better if there
was some money coming in.

364
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:05,906
Don't worry about a thing, honey.
Everything'll be super.

365
00:21:06,239 --> 00:21:07,773
$5,000 can't last forever.

366
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,773
We've spent
almost $1,000 already.

367
00:21:09,839 --> 00:21:11,773
The chump's wad
is still intact.

368
00:21:11,839 --> 00:21:13,773
All we spent is
what I saved.

369
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:15,773
We'll get set, baby.

370
00:21:15,839 --> 00:21:18,773
It's making the right
connections takes the time.

371
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,646
See that guy?
He's in the rackets.

372
00:21:28,713 --> 00:21:30,646
I've seen him
hanging around the hotel.

373
00:21:36,213 --> 00:21:38,880
Mmm-mmm!

374
00:21:38,946 --> 00:21:41,945
He's doing better
than alright.

375
00:21:42,246 --> 00:21:44,946
Look what
he's pushing around.

376
00:21:45,013 --> 00:21:47,946
She is attractive.

377
00:21:56,386 --> 00:21:58,386
That's the best part
of being in the big dough.

378
00:21:58,387 --> 00:22:01,721
You can canvass the field and
have all the dames you can use.

379
00:22:02,486 --> 00:22:04,319
Is that your ambition?

380
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:06,920
Well, no, not exactly,
but, uh,

381
00:22:08,152 --> 00:22:10,119
you can't blame me
for looking around, honey.

382
00:22:10,186 --> 00:22:12,919
- You won't give me a tumble.
- You know why?

383
00:22:13,552 --> 00:22:15,119
I can't imagine.

384
00:22:15,186 --> 00:22:16,652
Well, I could go for you.

385
00:22:16,719 --> 00:22:19,292
Sometimes I think
I even want to.

386
00:22:19,293 --> 00:22:21,726
You're nice.
You're not a collar ad,

387
00:22:21,727 --> 00:22:24,195
but you're not
bad-looking either.

388
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,526
But just when I get set to fall,
you spoil everything.

389
00:22:27,793 --> 00:22:30,293
- What do you mean?
- Just this:

390
00:22:30,794 --> 00:22:33,128
love doesn't mean
anything in your life.

391
00:22:33,129 --> 00:22:36,795
You think you can turn it on and off
by pushing a button like you do a light.

392
00:22:36,896 --> 00:22:39,029
You worship nothing
but dough.

393
00:22:39,526 --> 00:22:41,459
No, you're
not my type, Bert.

394
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:45,999
You got started on the wrong foot and Little Nell
is not going to be just another in your life.

395
00:22:46,232 --> 00:22:49,132
I say you're wrong.
Maybe someday you'll find out.

396
00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:52,965
I may not know much about making love,
but this one thing I do know.

397
00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:56,265
I've wanted you since
the first day I saw you,

398
00:22:56,266 --> 00:22:58,166
but if I can't have you,
I'll have somebody else.

399
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:00,565
We're getting too serious.
Let's dance.

400
00:23:04,332 --> 00:23:08,305
Hey, I told you once before
to cut that out.

401
00:23:08,371 --> 00:23:09,305
Yeah?

402
00:23:09,306 --> 00:23:11,306
Yeah, because
I don't like it.

403
00:23:11,307 --> 00:23:13,173
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

404
00:23:37,978 --> 00:23:39,312
Well, kid,

405
00:23:39,313 --> 00:23:41,946
- I want to thank you for fronting for me.
- Oh, that's alright.

406
00:23:41,947 --> 00:23:44,280
I don't like guys
who swing chairs.

407
00:23:44,745 --> 00:23:47,478
I'm Dan barker.
This is Miss Wilson.

408
00:23:47,479 --> 00:23:48,646
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

409
00:23:48,647 --> 00:23:50,547
I'm Bert Harris.
Miss Roberts.

410
00:23:50,548 --> 00:23:51,644
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

411
00:23:51,645 --> 00:23:53,012
I've seen you around
the hotel, haven't I?

412
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:55,947
Oh, I hold open house
now and then, yes.

413
00:23:56,378 --> 00:23:57,245
Do you two live here?

414
00:23:57,312 --> 00:23:59,618
No, just me. Miss Roberts
lives at the embassy.

415
00:23:59,684 --> 00:24:02,651
Oh, do you? I live around
the corner at the Wellington.

416
00:24:02,718 --> 00:24:04,951
Really? Then we're
almost neighbors.

417
00:24:05,018 --> 00:24:09,018
Mm-hmm. Well, uh, how about
finishing this dance?

418
00:24:09,084 --> 00:24:12,051
Well, if I can dance
with you, Mr. Harris,

419
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,051
I'll feel perfectly safe.

420
00:24:18,184 --> 00:24:20,784
Keep the home fires
burning.

421
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:26,024
The minute
I saw you, Bert,

422
00:24:26,090 --> 00:24:28,124
I knew you were
one of the boys.

423
00:24:28,190 --> 00:24:29,425
- Yeah?
- I...

424
00:24:29,525 --> 00:24:32,225
don't like to play with
strangers, but you look alright.

425
00:24:32,291 --> 00:24:34,025
You can depend on me,
if that's what you mean.

426
00:24:34,026 --> 00:24:36,093
- Things are pretty tough right now.
- Same everywhere.

427
00:24:36,425 --> 00:24:39,225
Just to pass the time away,
I'm working a new deal.

428
00:24:39,226 --> 00:24:42,226
It's out of my usual line,
but a buck is a buck.

429
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,160
- Keeps the wolf away.
- Exactly.

430
00:24:44,161 --> 00:24:48,394
The only reason I'm talking to you is
you've got an honest face and clean hands,

431
00:24:48,931 --> 00:24:50,497
and that's very important.

432
00:24:50,498 --> 00:24:53,265
You ever been mugged,
uh, arrested?

433
00:24:53,331 --> 00:24:54,531
No, never took a fall.

434
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:56,164
How much dough
can you raise?

435
00:24:56,231 --> 00:24:59,831
- Well, I got about $2,500.
- I said dough.

436
00:24:59,897 --> 00:25:02,431
That's nothing
but coffee and money.

437
00:25:03,832 --> 00:25:06,565
- That's all I've got.
- Well, how much can you promote?

438
00:25:07,331 --> 00:25:08,664
I don't know.

439
00:25:08,731 --> 00:25:11,231
The more you come up with,
the more you can make.

440
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:12,603
Money goes to money,
you know.

441
00:25:12,870 --> 00:25:14,170
Yeah, I know that...

442
00:25:14,237 --> 00:25:17,537
If all you can promote
is a couple of grand,

443
00:25:17,570 --> 00:25:19,803
forget it.

444
00:25:19,870 --> 00:25:22,803
Make off like I never
talked to you.

445
00:25:27,137 --> 00:25:28,803
Wait a minute.

446
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,804
Maybe I could get
as much again from Anne.

447
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:34,804
Who's that,
your sweetheart?

448
00:25:34,871 --> 00:25:37,004
No, my partner.

449
00:25:37,071 --> 00:25:38,344
Well, alright.

450
00:25:38,410 --> 00:25:42,577
You meet me in the lobby,
say, uh, at 1:00 tomorrow,

451
00:25:42,644 --> 00:25:44,610
And I'll show you
a couple of angles

452
00:25:44,677 --> 00:25:47,010
that will
blow your hat off.

453
00:25:47,077 --> 00:25:49,677
Alright, 1:00.

454
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:01,644
38. Number 38.

455
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:02,885
Yes, I know, but...

456
00:26:03,016 --> 00:26:05,783
Now, will you
stop worrying about Dan?

457
00:26:05,784 --> 00:26:09,350
Dan's a nice guy and I don't want
to be making a chump out of him.

458
00:26:09,351 --> 00:26:12,683
Oh, forget it.
We have an understanding.

459
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:16,916
He has his friends,
and I have mine.

460
00:26:16,983 --> 00:26:18,916
Ha ha.
How nice for you.

461
00:26:19,783 --> 00:26:22,050
I wonder what happened
to Bert and Helen?

462
00:26:22,051 --> 00:26:23,985
Oh, there they are.

463
00:26:28,389 --> 00:26:30,922
Where have you been? We've
been looking all over for you.

464
00:26:30,923 --> 00:26:33,757
Mm, I'll bet
you're all tired out.

465
00:26:36,223 --> 00:26:38,457
It's been a nice evening,
Dan, thanks to you.

466
00:26:38,557 --> 00:26:40,457
It's been a pleasure,
Bert.

467
00:26:40,557 --> 00:26:41,723
Oh, wait a minute.

468
00:26:42,590 --> 00:26:43,723
Good evening.

469
00:26:43,724 --> 00:26:46,557
- A package of Merits.
- Yes, sir.

470
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:49,690
Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't got
anything lower than a $20 bill.

471
00:26:49,757 --> 00:26:53,190
That's alright. You can't
annoy me with money, any kind.

472
00:27:07,363 --> 00:27:08,563
Thank you.

473
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,263
Well, that's that.
We'll be going home.

474
00:27:13,329 --> 00:27:15,263
Good night, kid.
See you tomorrow.

475
00:27:15,329 --> 00:27:17,596
Good night, Dan. You've
been a wonderful host.

476
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:19,302
The next party's on me.

477
00:27:19,369 --> 00:27:21,302
- Good night, little girl.
- Good night.

478
00:27:21,369 --> 00:27:24,069
I've had
a very pleasant evening.

479
00:27:25,735 --> 00:27:27,469
Good night, Bert.

480
00:27:29,369 --> 00:27:31,469
Good night, Helen.

481
00:27:32,835 --> 00:27:34,769
Good night.

482
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,674
Are you going my way?

483
00:27:47,442 --> 00:27:50,442
This suit of armor's worse
than that bellhop's outfit.

484
00:27:51,576 --> 00:27:54,076
Bert, I don't like that fellow.

485
00:27:54,477 --> 00:27:56,677
Nope, I can't use him.

486
00:27:56,678 --> 00:27:58,678
You've got to get used
to him and get to like him,

487
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,612
because you're going to see a lot of
him in the next few months.

488
00:28:01,613 --> 00:28:03,813
We're going to do
a little work together.

489
00:28:03,942 --> 00:28:05,909
That racket of his
sounds like a darb.

490
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:08,782
Why, I didn't see
any racket.

491
00:28:09,115 --> 00:28:10,615
Dumbbell.

492
00:28:10,616 --> 00:28:14,382
Didn't you see every time he bought
anything he paid for it with a $20 bill?

493
00:28:14,815 --> 00:28:17,648
- He pulled it just now at the cigar counter.
- Well, what of it?

494
00:28:27,048 --> 00:28:28,115
Not bad, huh?

495
00:28:28,182 --> 00:28:31,148
I wouldn't like it if it was good.
Because I don't like him.

496
00:28:31,149 --> 00:28:34,355
No? I know what's
bothering you.

497
00:28:34,754 --> 00:28:36,788
You're burned up
by that blond dame.

498
00:28:36,854 --> 00:28:40,389
Why should I be jealous
of a bleached-out bag like that?

499
00:28:40,490 --> 00:28:43,724
Of all the conceited apes I ever saw,
you take the cake.

500
00:28:44,255 --> 00:28:47,089
That's one of the million
reasons I'd never go for you.

501
00:28:47,255 --> 00:28:50,955
I wish you could get it in your thick skull that
I'm not at all interested in your lady friends.

502
00:28:50,956 --> 00:28:54,389
No? Well, we're going in with
Dan whether you like it or not.

503
00:28:54,489 --> 00:28:56,755
This is business.
It's not a beauty contest.

504
00:28:57,555 --> 00:28:59,328
Oh, you make me sick.

505
00:29:00,295 --> 00:29:02,695
You mean that blonde
makes you sick.

506
00:29:19,795 --> 00:29:21,695
Where are you, honey?

507
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:33,701
Anne, are you there?

508
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:34,934
Is it alright
for me to come in?

509
00:29:35,001 --> 00:29:36,934
Hey, what do you mean
crashing in like that?

510
00:29:36,935 --> 00:29:39,868
- Can't you see I'm taking a bath?
- Yeah? Move over.

511
00:29:40,301 --> 00:29:41,668
Hey!

512
00:29:42,402 --> 00:29:44,235
Seriously Anne,
this is important.

513
00:29:44,236 --> 00:29:47,469
I just came from the bank, and the
cashierhanded over 4 good 50s

514
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,909
for 10 of those phony 20s.
That's how good they are.

515
00:29:50,310 --> 00:29:52,143
- Looks great to me.
- Yeah?

516
00:29:52,241 --> 00:29:54,974
Mm-hmm, only my $2,500
isn't enough.

517
00:29:54,975 --> 00:29:58,742
Dan barker does things on a large scale,
and I need at least $5,000.

518
00:30:00,008 --> 00:30:01,408
Well, count me out.

519
00:30:01,741 --> 00:30:03,674
Well, we're still partners,
ain't we?

520
00:30:03,741 --> 00:30:06,241
I made money for you before,
and I can do it again.

521
00:30:06,242 --> 00:30:08,775
I guarantee you can double
your money in 24 hours.

522
00:30:08,776 --> 00:30:11,009
Come on, baby,
what do you say?

523
00:30:11,010 --> 00:30:13,410
It don't sound good to me,
but if I don't give you the money,

524
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:16,144
you'll probably steal it,
so take it, my friend.

525
00:30:16,145 --> 00:30:17,078
Where is it?

526
00:30:17,079 --> 00:30:18,879
In my brassiere.

527
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:22,780
- Where?
- In my brassiere.

528
00:30:23,247 --> 00:30:25,780
You got pockets in that?

529
00:30:45,387 --> 00:30:47,487
I've taken money
out of a lot of funny places,

530
00:30:47,554 --> 00:30:50,121
but never anything
like this before, honey.

531
00:31:03,793 --> 00:31:05,227
I hate to break in
on you like this.

532
00:31:05,293 --> 00:31:06,293
That's alright.

533
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,860
- Did you get the money?
- I got the 5 grand.

534
00:31:11,027 --> 00:31:13,027
- What's all the excitement?
- Now, here's what happened.

535
00:31:13,028 --> 00:31:16,328
Kansas City Dutch, that's the guy I get
these 20s from, is blowing town tonight.

536
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:20,362
The cops are on his tail. I got the call.
We got an hour. Now, here.

537
00:31:21,027 --> 00:31:24,460
Here's $10,000 of mine.
Put it with your $5,000.

538
00:31:25,393 --> 00:31:27,966
- You stick pretty close to that, don't'you?
- Very.

539
00:31:27,967 --> 00:31:29,967
I want you to do
a little bargaining.

540
00:31:30,033 --> 00:31:32,433
Dutch wants to rid of
as much green as possible,

541
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:34,032
but he's never done
business with you before,

542
00:31:34,033 --> 00:31:37,033
so you ought to be able to get
3 for 1 instead of 2 for 1.

543
00:31:37,034 --> 00:31:38,868
Only don't take no for an answer.

544
00:31:38,869 --> 00:31:40,736
- But why me?
- Well, I'd do the talking,

545
00:31:40,737 --> 00:31:43,570
Only Dutch would figure
I was a chiseler and fold up.

546
00:31:43,571 --> 00:31:45,571
Now, here...
Here's the idea.

547
00:31:45,572 --> 00:31:48,173
You just give him
the $15,000,

548
00:31:48,174 --> 00:31:51,041
and insist on $45,000.

549
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,540
Do you get it?
Nothing less.

550
00:31:55,606 --> 00:31:59,840
$25,000, $30,000, $35,000,
$40,000, $45,000.

551
00:32:00,040 --> 00:32:01,440
There you are.

552
00:32:01,506 --> 00:32:03,640
If the cops wasn't
so hard on me,

553
00:32:03,641 --> 00:32:05,575
and I could stay
around town,

554
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,340
you'd get $30,000
or nothing.

555
00:32:08,606 --> 00:32:11,140
Well, lot of luck, Dutch.
When you coming back?

556
00:32:11,141 --> 00:32:13,675
Next month,
if I keep out of the can.

557
00:32:13,676 --> 00:32:15,276
I'll get in touch with you.

558
00:32:15,277 --> 00:32:17,510
Hope you get into some
real money by then.

559
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:19,584
You can't keep
a good man down.

560
00:32:19,812 --> 00:32:20,746
You bet.

561
00:32:20,812 --> 00:32:23,512
Well, be seeing you.

562
00:32:23,579 --> 00:32:26,312
Put it in the grip.
We'll divide it at the hotel.

563
00:32:37,312 --> 00:32:38,312
It sure looks good.

564
00:32:38,379 --> 00:32:39,946
I can't tell it
from the real McCoy.

565
00:32:39,947 --> 00:32:42,281
Then nobody else could, either.
You'd better keep it tonight.

566
00:32:42,282 --> 00:32:46,022
No use me carrying that kind of money
around the streets, makes me sweat.

567
00:32:48,218 --> 00:32:49,153
Who's that?

568
00:32:49,219 --> 00:32:51,453
I don't know.

569
00:32:54,053 --> 00:32:55,119
Put it in here.

570
00:33:03,753 --> 00:33:04,819
Who's there?

571
00:33:04,886 --> 00:33:07,325
It's me... Helen.

572
00:33:09,792 --> 00:33:10,925
What's been keeping you?

573
00:33:11,059 --> 00:33:12,925
Don't I ever get tired
of waiting?

574
00:33:12,926 --> 00:33:14,792
But I was just leaving,
sweetheart.

575
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,425
Come on,
have a nightcap with me.

576
00:33:17,492 --> 00:33:18,492
No, thanks.

577
00:33:18,493 --> 00:33:20,893
All I need to fall asleep
is a bed.

578
00:33:20,894 --> 00:33:22,594
I'm dead.

579
00:33:22,595 --> 00:33:24,595
Come on, Dan,
don't be so inconsiderate.

580
00:33:24,596 --> 00:33:26,029
Okay, I'm blowing, Bert.

581
00:33:26,030 --> 00:33:29,963
Get yourself some rest, and tomorrow we'll
have one grand day laying the green.

582
00:33:29,964 --> 00:33:32,064
I'm itching to start.

583
00:33:32,392 --> 00:33:33,365
Where is Anne tonight?

584
00:33:33,431 --> 00:33:35,165
Oh, out with
some other guy.

585
00:33:35,166 --> 00:33:36,466
2-timing you, eh?

586
00:33:36,467 --> 00:33:38,500
No, we're not that way.
We're just partners.

587
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:42,798
As for me, I'm very much
in circulation.

588
00:33:42,865 --> 00:33:44,364
That's good news.

589
00:33:44,365 --> 00:33:46,198
Maybe I can
get rid of Dan some night

590
00:33:46,199 --> 00:33:48,532
and we can go out
together, alone.

591
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,099
But don't get caught.

592
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:53,768
Now listen kid, lock this door
and sleep with one eye open.

593
00:33:53,769 --> 00:33:55,369
Chances are I won't
be able to sleep at all.

594
00:33:55,370 --> 00:33:57,670
I can understand that.
See you in the A.M.

595
00:33:57,766 --> 00:33:58,805
- Goodbye.
- Good night.

596
00:33:58,806 --> 00:34:00,139
- Good night kid.
- Good night.

597
00:35:45,730 --> 00:35:48,463
I never saw anyone so stupid
in all my life.

598
00:35:48,464 --> 00:35:50,564
Ha ha. The poor chump.

599
00:35:50,565 --> 00:35:53,165
You know, all smartened up
from that goofy scrapbook.

600
00:35:53,363 --> 00:35:56,297
He thought that real money
you sold him was counterfeit.

601
00:35:56,363 --> 00:35:58,298
Yeah, he said
it looked perfect.

602
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,131
He couldn't tell it
from the real stuff.

603
00:36:01,198 --> 00:36:02,698
What a mug.

604
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:09,104
Miss Roberts, please.
Hello, Anne? It's Bert.

605
00:36:09,137 --> 00:36:11,637
Listen, honey, I won't
be able to see you today.

606
00:36:11,704 --> 00:36:14,004
Something came up
that's going to tie me up.

607
00:36:14,104 --> 00:36:15,404
Is anything the matter?

608
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:18,537
Of course not. Don't worry
about a thing, will you?

609
00:36:18,538 --> 00:36:21,638
Alright. If you've still
got the money, hang on to it.

610
00:36:21,639 --> 00:36:24,406
Sure. I've got the money
in my pocket right now.

611
00:36:24,407 --> 00:36:26,340
Yeah. Okay.

612
00:37:27,256 --> 00:37:28,623
How do you do?
How do you do?

613
00:37:28,689 --> 00:37:30,623
I'm Mr. Alexander Porter's
secretary.

614
00:37:30,624 --> 00:37:32,858
And I want to select
a diamond bracelet.

615
00:37:32,859 --> 00:37:34,993
Mr. Porter just announced his
daughter's engagement, you know?

616
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:37,294
Yes, I read about it.
Would you step this way, please?

617
00:37:41,756 --> 00:37:43,895
Show this gentleman
some bracelets.

618
00:37:43,962 --> 00:37:45,395
This young man
will wait on you.

619
00:37:45,396 --> 00:37:46,863
- Thank you.
- Pardon me.

620
00:37:46,864 --> 00:37:49,398
What did you have in mind?
Anything in particular?

621
00:37:49,699 --> 00:37:51,165
Mm, no.

622
00:37:51,462 --> 00:37:54,929
Uh, let me see these.

623
00:38:10,969 --> 00:38:13,936
How much is this one?

624
00:38:13,937 --> 00:38:14,937
$15,000.

625
00:38:20,136 --> 00:38:22,202
This is very nice,
I think I'll take this one.

626
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:24,402
That is, pending
Mr. Porter's approval.

627
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:28,302
Would you mind sending it to his residence,
1516 Lake Shore drive, immediately,

628
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:31,102
- and charge it to his account, please.
- Thank you very much indeed, sir.

629
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:34,076
- I shall have it sent within the hour.
- And may I have your card, please?

630
00:38:34,077 --> 00:38:35,077
Certainly.

631
00:38:38,008 --> 00:38:40,342
Thank you so much,
Mr. Roland.

632
00:38:40,343 --> 00:38:41,643
Thank you.

633
00:38:59,281 --> 00:39:01,514
Package for Mr. Porter
from Gorman & Co.

634
00:39:01,581 --> 00:39:02,614
Will you sign, please?

635
00:39:02,615 --> 00:39:03,715
Very good.

636
00:39:09,115 --> 00:39:10,382
Thank you.

637
00:39:15,949 --> 00:39:19,149
Hello, is this the residence
Of Alexander Porter?

638
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,382
Yes. This is
the Porter residence.

639
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:24,822
This is the Gorman jewelry
establishment calling.

640
00:39:24,823 --> 00:39:26,289
Through an unfortunate error,

641
00:39:26,290 --> 00:39:29,490
a package intended for another of our
patrons was delivered at your house.

642
00:39:29,555 --> 00:39:31,621
The package is
right here, sir.

643
00:39:31,622 --> 00:39:34,055
Our Mr. Roland will call
for it immediately.

644
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:35,756
Roland.

645
00:39:35,757 --> 00:39:38,557
R-O-L-A-N-D.

646
00:39:38,957 --> 00:39:39,857
Yes.

647
00:39:39,858 --> 00:39:41,958
Would you mind giving it
to him when he arrives?

648
00:39:41,959 --> 00:39:46,825
Yes, sir. Mr. Roland.
I will expect him, sir.

649
00:39:46,826 --> 00:39:48,698
Oh, thanks so much.
Thank you.

650
00:40:01,761 --> 00:40:04,594
So, uh, I'm Mr. Roland
of the Gorman company.

651
00:40:06,061 --> 00:40:07,895
Oh, Mr. Roland,

652
00:40:07,896 --> 00:40:09,929
your manager telephoned me
to expect you.

653
00:40:10,062 --> 00:40:11,595
One moment, please.

654
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:18,901
Oh, thank you.
Thank you so much.

655
00:40:36,734 --> 00:40:38,474
It's nice.
Maybe it's too nice.

656
00:40:38,475 --> 00:40:41,109
What'll I do with it?
That stuff is hard to sell.

657
00:40:41,110 --> 00:40:44,177
Who cares, give it to your wife
for a Christmas present.

658
00:40:46,074 --> 00:40:47,607
Listen, 3 balls,

659
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:50,141
I want $5,000
and I want it in a hurry.

660
00:40:50,174 --> 00:40:52,840
It's worth $20,000.
Don't give me any back talk.

661
00:40:52,907 --> 00:40:55,574
Well, don't get excited.
We can talk it over.

662
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:59,140
I don't want any talk. I want
5 grand, and I want it now.

663
00:41:06,213 --> 00:41:08,280
Alright, I'll...
I'll buy it.

664
00:41:17,014 --> 00:41:21,014
My, but you're a tough guy.

665
00:41:21,081 --> 00:41:24,247
Not tough, just mercenary.

666
00:41:34,787 --> 00:41:38,487
Dan didn't take me, but he tried
to, and that's what burns me up.

667
00:41:38,553 --> 00:41:40,087
How much did we lose?

668
00:41:40,088 --> 00:41:44,755
Not a dime, I was too fastborn.
I got all our original dough back.

669
00:41:44,887 --> 00:41:45,987
That's a break.

670
00:41:46,053 --> 00:41:47,253
What's a break?

671
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:50,553
Listen, I don't invest money
just to get it back.

672
00:41:50,620 --> 00:41:53,491
Dan promised me a profit,
and a profit I'll get.

673
00:41:53,558 --> 00:41:56,526
What's that got to do
with this trip to New York?

674
00:41:56,593 --> 00:41:58,893
Nothing, except that
Dan barker, the rat,

675
00:41:58,959 --> 00:42:00,959
Is headed that way himself.

676
00:42:01,926 --> 00:42:05,359
I guess you didn't have much time
to say goodbye to that blonde, did you?

677
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:06,926
Isn't that too bad?

678
00:42:13,860 --> 00:42:16,227
Oh, Bert, sometimes
you act like a kid.

679
00:42:16,294 --> 00:42:19,300
You lie, and you pout,
and you won't give in.

680
00:42:19,366 --> 00:42:22,200
- Who's lying?
- You are. That's alright.

681
00:42:22,201 --> 00:42:24,834
I'll pretend
to believe you, Skippy.

682
00:42:45,006 --> 00:42:47,706
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- That's alright.

683
00:42:50,506 --> 00:42:52,472
Oh, what's the matter?
Something in your eye?

684
00:42:52,473 --> 00:42:53,640
A cinder, I guess.

685
00:42:53,641 --> 00:42:56,508
- Oh, may I try and take it out?
- Would you?

686
00:42:57,906 --> 00:43:00,406
Now look up.
Keep still.

687
00:43:06,206 --> 00:43:07,639
There it is.

688
00:43:07,906 --> 00:43:09,645
Oh, it's not very big, is it?

689
00:43:09,646 --> 00:43:12,079
No, just a little fellow.
Do you feel better?

690
00:43:12,112 --> 00:43:13,312
Yes, thanks.

691
00:43:13,378 --> 00:43:15,946
Well, my name is Reynolds,
Joe Reynolds.

692
00:43:15,947 --> 00:43:18,747
- And mine's Anne Roberts.
- I'm afraid our etiquette's a bit reversed.

693
00:43:18,748 --> 00:43:20,582
Yes, I guess Emily Post
wouldn't approve

694
00:43:20,583 --> 00:43:23,317
of looking into a lady's eyes
before being introduced to her.

695
00:43:23,318 --> 00:43:26,885
Well, maybe Emily post couldn't
appreciate such eyes as yours.

696
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,546
But seriously, have you anything to wash
them with, some antiseptic or something?

697
00:43:30,547 --> 00:43:33,613
No, but they must have on the train.
I'll ask the Porter.

698
00:43:33,614 --> 00:43:36,847
I have some boric acid in my bag.
I'm in the next car.

699
00:43:36,952 --> 00:43:39,085
You talk
like a physician.

700
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:43,019
- And how do you feel now?
- Very much better, thank you.

701
00:43:43,185 --> 00:43:44,619
Fine.

702
00:43:44,620 --> 00:43:46,554
- Do you do much traveling?
- Well yes,

703
00:43:46,555 --> 00:43:48,955
you see, my firm is a member
of the New York stock exchange,

704
00:43:48,956 --> 00:43:50,889
as well as that
of Chicago and Boston.

705
00:43:50,890 --> 00:43:52,190
They keep me jumping
pretty much.

706
00:43:52,252 --> 00:43:55,119
This will be my first visit
east in several years.

707
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:56,320
Oh, here comes my partner.

708
00:43:56,519 --> 00:43:58,958
Bert, I'd like you to meet
Mr. Reynolds. Mr. Harris.

709
00:43:59,025 --> 00:44:00,491
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

710
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:03,892
Something flew in my eye, and
Mr. Reynolds was kind enough to remove it.

711
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:08,025
Lucky for you I wasn't there.
You'd probably be minus an eye.

712
00:44:08,091 --> 00:44:11,691
Partners are unfair.
Because I have two eyes,

713
00:44:11,758 --> 00:44:13,991
Mr. Harris would expect me
to give him one.

714
00:44:13,992 --> 00:44:16,625
Well, I must bathe my eye.
Thank you again, you've been awfully sweet.

715
00:44:16,758 --> 00:44:19,859
Well, I hope you'll give me the opportunity
of seeing something of you in New York.

716
00:44:19,860 --> 00:44:23,060
- Shan't we see more of each other on the train?
- How about breakfast?

717
00:44:23,061 --> 00:44:25,532
- Swell.
- Splendid.

718
00:44:28,965 --> 00:44:31,698
- I'm delighted to have met you, sir.
- Oh, uh...

719
00:44:31,699 --> 00:44:33,232
the pleasure's mutual.

720
00:44:46,132 --> 00:44:48,637
Little girl
like 'em nice mans?

721
00:44:52,071 --> 00:44:55,371
I think I could prime
that chump for a take.

722
00:44:55,438 --> 00:44:57,371
He looks like ready money.

723
00:44:57,438 --> 00:45:00,338
Is that all you ever think of,
Bert... swindling somebody?

724
00:45:00,339 --> 00:45:02,173
Why don't you take them
one at a time?

725
00:45:02,304 --> 00:45:04,904
Yesterday you were going to
follow Dan around the world.

726
00:45:04,971 --> 00:45:06,904
Now you've forgotten
all about it.

727
00:45:06,971 --> 00:45:09,004
I haven't forgotten
anything.

728
00:45:09,071 --> 00:45:11,004
Only why shouldn't we
take Reynolds?

729
00:45:11,071 --> 00:45:15,306
- He isn't any better than anybody else, is he?
- Maybe he is. I sort of like him.

730
00:45:15,307 --> 00:45:17,274
As long as I do,
you lay off.

731
00:45:17,275 --> 00:45:19,276
There are plenty others.

732
00:45:19,745 --> 00:45:21,445
Mm-hmm.

733
00:45:25,711 --> 00:45:29,145
This is the first time
I've ever seen you weaken.

734
00:45:29,611 --> 00:45:31,878
He must work fast.

735
00:45:32,445 --> 00:45:33,711
He does.

736
00:45:33,778 --> 00:45:37,245
You should take
a few lessons.

737
00:45:37,311 --> 00:45:39,551
Aw, nuts.

738
00:45:53,284 --> 00:45:55,017
It's tough nowadays.

739
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,285
Sometimes I think
I'll go legit.

740
00:45:57,386 --> 00:46:01,953
You couldn't. Trick laws and shyster
lawyers won't let a guy go straight.

741
00:46:06,690 --> 00:46:09,557
Say, who's the dame
over there?

742
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:22,824
- Miss Roberts.
- How are you, Mr. barker?

743
00:46:22,825 --> 00:46:24,958
Well, we meet again.
May I sit down?

744
00:46:24,959 --> 00:46:26,692
Please do.

745
00:46:26,991 --> 00:46:28,529
I ate at that table.

746
00:46:28,530 --> 00:46:31,897
Bring me the check, will you,
and a fresh pot of coffee?

747
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:32,964
Yes, sir.

748
00:46:33,030 --> 00:46:34,563
Am I taking you
from someone?

749
00:46:34,564 --> 00:46:37,164
That mug's just
out of the big house.

750
00:46:37,230 --> 00:46:39,164
More solitary
won't hurt him.

751
00:46:39,230 --> 00:46:41,230
You're sure looking great.

752
00:46:41,297 --> 00:46:43,630
Say, whatever happened
with that young squirt?

753
00:46:43,631 --> 00:46:45,564
Bert was his name,
wasn't it?

754
00:46:45,565 --> 00:46:47,798
You were never meant
for a chump like that.

755
00:46:47,997 --> 00:46:52,030
Did he ever tell you how we took him
in that fake counterfeiting gag?

756
00:46:52,930 --> 00:46:55,770
Ha ha. He fell for that
hook, line, and sinker.

757
00:46:55,771 --> 00:46:57,705
I took him for 5 grand,

758
00:46:57,936 --> 00:47:01,470
and the payoff was the note
that Helen left for him...

759
00:47:01,471 --> 00:47:05,438
"paste this in your scrapbook.
Love and kisses, Helen."

760
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:09,836
By th way, where is Helen?

761
00:47:09,903 --> 00:47:12,136
I sent her back
where I got her from.

762
00:47:12,137 --> 00:47:13,870
Have her
on a 30-day free trial?

763
00:47:13,871 --> 00:47:17,304
Exactly, and all she cost me
was the down payment.

764
00:47:18,003 --> 00:47:19,776
What are you doing
these days?

765
00:47:19,842 --> 00:47:22,209
I got a brand-new racket.

766
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:32,977
- Hello, honey.
- Hello, baby.

767
00:47:33,443 --> 00:47:35,577
- Ready to eat?
- Sure. I'll put on my hat.

768
00:47:35,578 --> 00:47:38,178
You sit down and rest
your hands and face.

769
00:47:48,349 --> 00:47:51,316
Hmm! Browning.

770
00:47:52,183 --> 00:47:54,116
Not really.

771
00:47:57,816 --> 00:48:01,249
"To Anne.
This book so suitable. Joe."

772
00:48:01,316 --> 00:48:02,749
You never told me.

773
00:48:07,616 --> 00:48:09,922
"No shade encroaching
on the matchless mould

774
00:48:09,923 --> 00:48:12,323
"of those two lips,
which should be opening soft

775
00:48:12,324 --> 00:48:15,224
"in the pure profile,

776
00:48:15,225 --> 00:48:18,458
"not as when she laughs"...
Ha ha!

777
00:48:18,459 --> 00:48:21,126
"For that spoils all.
But, rather as if aloft

778
00:48:21,127 --> 00:48:24,227
"yon hyacinth she loves so,

779
00:48:24,228 --> 00:48:26,661
"burden of honey-colored buds

780
00:48:26,822 --> 00:48:31,090
"and capture 'twixt the lips
apart for this."

781
00:48:31,391 --> 00:48:34,264
Now, honey, I ask you,

782
00:48:35,165 --> 00:48:37,499
is this the kind of hooey
that guy Reynolds hands out?

783
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:40,467
Why, I think it's lovely.

784
00:48:41,629 --> 00:48:44,396
He may be a poet to you,
he's just a peasant to me.

785
00:48:44,397 --> 00:48:46,131
Come on, let's get out of here.

786
00:48:46,132 --> 00:48:49,766
I'm starved. I could eat
the hip off a horse.

787
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,196
Well, I'll go with you,
but I'm not very hungry.

788
00:48:54,197 --> 00:48:55,929
I had a late luncheon.

789
00:48:56,196 --> 00:48:58,401
Whose guest
do you think I was?

790
00:48:58,402 --> 00:49:00,936
Don't tell me.
Don't tell me.

791
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:01,970
Einstein.

792
00:49:02,035 --> 00:49:05,268
No, silly.
You'd be very interested.

793
00:49:05,269 --> 00:49:07,836
Oh, the high and mighty
Joe Reynolds, I suppose.

794
00:49:07,837 --> 00:49:10,071
The poetry shark.

795
00:49:10,168 --> 00:49:12,102
No, I saw Joe yesterday.

796
00:49:12,103 --> 00:49:14,537
We had lunch together,
and I met his father.

797
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:16,538
Alright, alright.
Who else, then?

798
00:49:16,539 --> 00:49:18,372
Dan.

799
00:49:18,935 --> 00:49:21,008
Dan Barker?

800
00:49:21,609 --> 00:49:23,709
Did you talk with him?

801
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:26,910
Why, certainly. I said
we had luncheon together.

802
00:49:26,911 --> 00:49:30,479
Well, I'll bet he laid off me.

803
00:49:30,575 --> 00:49:32,809
You're all we talked about.

804
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:40,675
He's living
at the Saint Anthony.

805
00:49:40,676 --> 00:49:43,809
He always stays at the best,
doesn't he?

806
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:46,710
Just let me get my hands on him,
he'll stay at the best hospital.

807
00:49:47,209 --> 00:49:49,081
What did he have to say about me?

808
00:49:49,082 --> 00:49:52,882
Everything,
and by the way,

809
00:49:53,115 --> 00:49:55,215
I have a message
for you...

810
00:49:55,216 --> 00:49:58,082
Helen sends her love
and kisses.

811
00:49:58,915 --> 00:50:02,281
The dirty, yellow-bellied,
double-crossing burglars.

812
00:50:02,282 --> 00:50:04,015
And you laughing at me
with him!

813
00:50:04,016 --> 00:50:05,749
A fine partner you are.

814
00:50:05,750 --> 00:50:08,083
Why don't you put in with him?
You'd make a swell pair, you two.

815
00:50:08,084 --> 00:50:10,117
- Now, wait a minute.
- Aw, get away from me.

816
00:50:10,118 --> 00:50:13,291
You're as wet as he is,
always rubbing things in.

817
00:50:16,954 --> 00:50:19,587
Oh, you talk like a child.

818
00:50:19,954 --> 00:50:21,487
Now, before we go
any further,

819
00:50:21,488 --> 00:50:24,588
tell me how you got
the money we came here on.

820
00:50:28,921 --> 00:50:31,155
Well,

821
00:50:31,156 --> 00:50:33,456
I never had any intention
of telling you, but...

822
00:50:34,922 --> 00:50:38,055
I stole a necklace from a jeweler
and sold it to a fence.

823
00:50:38,056 --> 00:50:39,328
Stole it?

824
00:50:40,561 --> 00:50:42,494
Stealing's not your racket.

825
00:50:42,561 --> 00:50:46,561
Well, I didn't exactly
steal it.

826
00:50:46,562 --> 00:50:49,062
I pulled it neatly enough.
You can bank on that.

827
00:50:49,063 --> 00:50:51,163
But I was desperate.
I had to get your dough back.

828
00:50:51,164 --> 00:50:53,578
But out-and-out thievery's
not your style, Bert.

829
00:50:53,579 --> 00:50:55,994
The worst you ever did was
take from wise guys,

830
00:50:56,061 --> 00:50:59,128
cheat a lot of cheaters,
but this thing...

831
00:50:59,294 --> 00:51:01,128
You might've
been caught.

832
00:51:01,594 --> 00:51:04,667
But I wasn't. You don't think
I was that clumsy, do you?

833
00:51:05,034 --> 00:51:08,700
Bert, you're such a boy.
You'll never grow up.

834
00:51:08,867 --> 00:51:11,634
Oh, I'm sorry I got
into this whole business.

835
00:51:11,935 --> 00:51:15,634
At first, it was clever and shrewd,
but now that we've resorted to this,

836
00:51:16,135 --> 00:51:19,034
I suppose next week
you'll rob a bank or something.

837
00:51:19,434 --> 00:51:22,500
Sounds like some
of Joe Reynolds' influence.

838
00:51:22,634 --> 00:51:25,800
That guy
gives me the cramps.

839
00:51:26,267 --> 00:51:30,906
Well, I can't stop you, if you
want to turn yellow and quit.

840
00:51:44,674 --> 00:51:47,974
This isn't some of Dan Barker's work?
You haven't fallen for his line, have you?

841
00:51:47,975 --> 00:51:49,907
You're hurting me, Bert.

842
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,213
I'm sorry.

843
00:52:01,247 --> 00:52:03,047
No, it's not Dan's work.

844
00:52:03,113 --> 00:52:05,680
I'm not going to take
a run-out powder, either,

845
00:52:05,681 --> 00:52:07,314
Not now, anyway.

846
00:52:07,347 --> 00:52:09,180
I'm going to stick
with you.

847
00:52:09,647 --> 00:52:12,647
I'm going to even up the score
with Dan Barker for you.

848
00:52:12,648 --> 00:52:15,082
He took our dough,
and he's going to pay.

849
00:52:15,213 --> 00:52:19,652
He made you resort
to common dirty thievery.

850
00:52:19,653 --> 00:52:23,153
We'll make him resort to worse
than that before we finish.

851
00:52:23,219 --> 00:52:24,853
That a baby.

852
00:52:24,854 --> 00:52:26,488
You had me worried
for a minute.

853
00:52:26,489 --> 00:52:28,223
Come on, now,
what are the plans?

854
00:52:28,224 --> 00:52:29,524
Never mind.

855
00:52:29,525 --> 00:52:31,292
You asked me before
if I was hungry.

856
00:52:31,293 --> 00:52:33,626
Well, come on,
I've got an appetite now.

857
00:52:33,653 --> 00:52:36,653
We'll split the hip
of that horse between us.

858
00:52:40,320 --> 00:52:43,054
That gets it, baby.
Ha!

859
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:55,660
You got a great idea, Anne.
I got to give you credit.

860
00:52:55,726 --> 00:52:58,360
And believe me... this old gent
bellock's stuck on me.

861
00:52:58,661 --> 00:53:00,561
He'll do anything I say.

862
00:53:00,593 --> 00:53:02,560
I have to have somebody
to work with,

863
00:53:02,761 --> 00:53:04,261
And I like you, Dan.

864
00:53:04,262 --> 00:53:07,529
- You're my style.
— And you were made to order for me, honey.

865
00:53:07,530 --> 00:53:11,403
If your man's as good as you say,
we'll take him for enough to blow the country.

866
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:14,599
What time does he get in?

867
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:17,133
Usually early in the morning.
He stays at the Miranda.

868
00:53:17,134 --> 00:53:19,934
Oh, fine.
I got everything set.

869
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:22,732
It's our first job together.
We've gotta be on our toes.

870
00:53:24,999 --> 00:53:27,232
I'll see who it is.

871
00:53:32,166 --> 00:53:34,037
Hello, Mike.

872
00:53:34,038 --> 00:53:35,871
Hello, Dan.
Your car's ready.

873
00:53:35,872 --> 00:53:38,488
Everything's ready.
Let's be on our way.

874
00:53:38,489 --> 00:53:41,506
I'll slip on a dress
make it snappy, honey.

875
00:53:42,406 --> 00:53:43,973
I consider myself fortunate,

876
00:53:44,039 --> 00:53:46,106
getting to town
before this meet broke up.

877
00:53:46,173 --> 00:53:47,239
You're right, colonel.

878
00:53:47,240 --> 00:53:49,173
There's some great horseflesh
out here now.

879
00:53:49,306 --> 00:53:51,539
This track is becoming
more important every year.

880
00:53:51,540 --> 00:53:53,707
It certainly is.
Not a major stable missing.

881
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:55,906
And the management
is perfect, I hear.

882
00:53:55,973 --> 00:53:57,206
Void of fraud,

883
00:53:57,273 --> 00:54:00,012
And no stigma
of unsportsmanship whatsoever.

884
00:54:00,013 --> 00:54:02,646
Beyond criticism, colonel,
we're mighty proud of that.

885
00:54:02,879 --> 00:54:04,079
As it should be.

886
00:54:04,080 --> 00:54:07,080
The sport of kings
should be respected.

887
00:54:07,312 --> 00:54:09,812
Will you
be ready soon, dear?

888
00:54:09,879 --> 00:54:10,845
Just a minute, colonel.

889
00:54:10,912 --> 00:54:12,779
I've got a run
in my stocking.

890
00:54:12,845 --> 00:54:14,579
How did you like
the golf course?

891
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:16,680
Splendid, very sporty.

892
00:54:17,012 --> 00:54:19,579
Anne and I played 18 holes
this morning.

893
00:54:19,645 --> 00:54:22,312
I'm very fond
of this entire hotel.

894
00:54:22,379 --> 00:54:25,318
Hurry, dear,
we'll miss the first race.

895
00:54:25,385 --> 00:54:27,685
Just a minute, colonel.

896
00:54:27,785 --> 00:54:29,885
Oh, these women...

897
00:54:29,886 --> 00:54:34,186
I think I've waited 1,000
years for them in my time.

898
00:54:34,218 --> 00:54:37,418
But they're worth it,
aren't they, colonel?

899
00:54:37,485 --> 00:54:39,185
This one in particular.

900
00:54:59,092 --> 00:55:01,225
Looks as if we missed
that first race.

901
00:55:01,292 --> 00:55:03,792
And it's all my fault.
I kept you waiting.

902
00:55:03,825 --> 00:55:05,358
Oh, that's alright.

903
00:55:05,359 --> 00:55:07,992
Although I did have a horse
picked in that first race,

904
00:55:07,993 --> 00:55:09,893
a sure winner, colonel.

905
00:55:09,894 --> 00:55:11,794
I didn't have a chance
to look at the entries.

906
00:55:11,795 --> 00:55:14,201
Oh, here,
look them over.

907
00:55:14,631 --> 00:55:16,564
Why not bet
between yourselves?

908
00:55:16,631 --> 00:55:19,331
You, Dan, pick a horse,
and you, colonel, book.

909
00:55:19,398 --> 00:55:22,631
Not a bad idea if the colonel
wants to be a sucker.

910
00:55:22,632 --> 00:55:23,965
Quite the contrary.

911
00:55:23,966 --> 00:55:25,899
I'd consider it
very sporting.

912
00:55:26,398 --> 00:55:28,231
Well, it's a swell way
to pass the time.

913
00:55:28,232 --> 00:55:30,365
We're still a half-hour
from the track.

914
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:32,799
Hello, Louie,
who won the first race today?

915
00:55:33,998 --> 00:55:35,431
Who?

916
00:55:35,798 --> 00:55:37,631
Okay.

917
00:55:54,905 --> 00:55:57,638
Some mighty good horses
in that first race.

918
00:55:57,639 --> 00:56:00,672
Yes, and the track ought to be
in pretty good shape, too.

919
00:56:19,244 --> 00:56:22,644
Captain's boy is my choice
at 2-to-1 odds.

920
00:56:22,645 --> 00:56:24,511
How much do you want to bet?

921
00:56:24,512 --> 00:56:27,212
Well, say $500?

922
00:56:27,477 --> 00:56:29,617
Why not make it $1,000?

923
00:56:29,683 --> 00:56:31,017
Alright.

924
00:56:31,583 --> 00:56:33,017
Shall Anne hold my money?

925
00:56:33,083 --> 00:56:37,550
Surely, if you can trust
my sweet little friend.

926
00:56:46,550 --> 00:56:48,951
Who won the second race?

927
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:51,284
The second race.

928
00:56:51,351 --> 00:56:52,684
Who?

929
00:56:52,818 --> 00:56:56,024
Okay, okay.

930
00:56:56,090 --> 00:56:58,024
Fine time
to run out of gasoline.

931
00:56:58,090 --> 00:57:01,457
- Why don't you look out for these things?
- Sorry sir, I never knew the tank was near empty.

932
00:57:01,458 --> 00:57:04,958
Hurry up, will you? The races
will be over before we get there.

933
00:57:08,524 --> 00:57:10,757
Well, I guess the second race
is on by now.

934
00:57:10,758 --> 00:57:12,458
Say, do you want me
to keep book this time?

935
00:57:12,459 --> 00:57:15,626
No, you bet.
I'll be a real bookie.

936
00:57:15,627 --> 00:57:18,633
And I've got plenty of cash
to pay off if I lose.

937
00:57:19,496 --> 00:57:21,030
Okay, colonel.

938
00:57:38,130 --> 00:57:39,863
What's your choice
this time?

939
00:57:39,864 --> 00:57:42,364
Well, this time
I'll take high ball.

940
00:57:42,696 --> 00:57:46,036
Sounds like a good thing
in these prohibition days.

941
00:57:46,102 --> 00:57:47,169
Same amount?

942
00:57:47,236 --> 00:57:49,002
No, let's make it
$1,500 this time,

943
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:51,904
so if I lose the first race
I won't be out so much.

944
00:57:52,037 --> 00:57:55,603
Okay, here you are,
little stakeholder.

945
00:58:01,803 --> 00:58:04,037
Suppose we take
the third race.

946
00:58:04,103 --> 00:58:06,737
Betting this way is
as much fun as at the track.

947
00:58:06,738 --> 00:58:10,977
Yeah. We've been delayed so much,
I suppose the third race is on now.

948
00:58:20,476 --> 00:58:22,743
Well, I'll take a chance
on Queenie.

949
00:58:22,843 --> 00:58:26,509
I've taken a chance
on Queenies many times.

950
00:58:26,510 --> 00:58:29,710
Stop now, colonel.
You're making me jealous.

951
00:58:31,043 --> 00:58:33,847
Same amount... $1,500?

952
00:58:33,848 --> 00:58:35,849
How'd you like to make it
really interesting?

953
00:58:35,882 --> 00:58:38,049
How about $5,000?
Can you cover it?

954
00:58:38,050 --> 00:58:41,250
Sure I can.
The sky is the limit.

955
00:58:41,251 --> 00:58:42,617
Okay, colonel.

956
00:58:43,249 --> 00:58:45,482
Well, there you are, Anne.
Hang on to that,

957
00:58:45,483 --> 00:58:48,049
you'll probably be giving it
back to me in a little while.

958
00:59:01,289 --> 00:59:03,622
You didn't pick a winner
in the whole lot.

959
00:59:03,623 --> 00:59:06,255
I won all three bets.

960
00:59:06,256 --> 00:59:08,655
Here you are, colonel.
You sure are lucky.

961
00:59:08,656 --> 00:59:13,556
Oh, the boys at the club will be
knocked cold when I tell them this.

962
00:59:24,062 --> 00:59:25,962
What the devil happened?

963
00:59:26,328 --> 00:59:29,062
That chauffeur of mine
double-crossed me, I'll cut his heart out.

964
00:59:29,128 --> 00:59:30,095
Don't worry, Dan.

965
00:59:30,162 --> 00:59:32,462
We'll take him
before we leave town.

966
00:59:34,562 --> 00:59:35,828
Hey, Mike.

967
00:59:36,995 --> 00:59:37,928
Mike!

968
01:00:07,002 --> 01:00:09,635
$40, $60, $80, $100.

969
01:00:10,102 --> 01:00:13,202
There you are, baldy...
I mean, colonel. You did swell.

970
01:00:13,203 --> 01:00:15,042
I've got another
$100 coming, ain't I?

971
01:00:15,043 --> 01:00:18,276
Nothing doing. You did it so well,
you can do it again without our help.

972
01:00:18,277 --> 01:00:19,544
You flatter me.

973
01:00:19,545 --> 01:00:21,412
Here, Mike. That's worth
your trouble, isn't it?

974
01:00:21,413 --> 01:00:23,879
- You said it, baby.
- Now you fellows lay low.

975
01:00:23,880 --> 01:00:26,180
Dan Barker is probably
looking for you right this minute.

976
01:00:26,181 --> 01:00:29,581
They'll never cath me and the colonel.
We're going to blow this burg right now.

977
01:00:35,675 --> 01:00:37,308
Thank heavens
that's over with.

978
01:00:37,575 --> 01:00:40,681
You have no idea how hard it is
to put up with getting pawed

979
01:00:40,682 --> 01:00:42,616
by someone you don't care for.

980
01:00:44,781 --> 01:00:46,947
Are you satisfied
with our revenge?

981
01:00:47,114 --> 01:00:51,147
Isn't that a darn sight more gratifying
than just punching him in the nose?

982
01:00:51,214 --> 01:00:54,747
With all this dough in my hands,
how can I say you're wrong?

983
01:00:55,214 --> 01:00:57,348
Is money
all you ever think of?

984
01:00:57,615 --> 01:00:59,282
No, Anne.

985
01:00:59,348 --> 01:01:01,848
Money is just a means
to an end with me.

986
01:01:02,715 --> 01:01:04,688
There's always been a lot of
things I've wanted to do.

987
01:01:04,689 --> 01:01:06,289
I wanna go to Europe.

988
01:01:06,290 --> 01:01:09,456
I wanna mix with those swell people
and see all those swell places.

989
01:01:09,621 --> 01:01:12,787
You know,
we could go together.

990
01:01:13,888 --> 01:01:15,654
Here's your end
of the take.

991
01:01:15,755 --> 01:01:19,188
I suppose you will want to buy
yourself a separate stateroom.

992
01:01:25,388 --> 01:01:27,926
Listen, Anne,
I'm nuts about you.

993
01:01:28,594 --> 01:01:31,827
Simply because I don't say it the
usual way and say the usual things

994
01:01:31,828 --> 01:01:33,894
doesn't mean that
I mean it any the less.

995
01:01:34,027 --> 01:01:36,094
It's not easy for me.
Oh, I don't know.

996
01:01:36,127 --> 01:01:40,994
I want you, that's all.
Anne, let's get married.

997
01:01:43,244 --> 01:01:45,910
That's sweet of you, Bert.

998
01:01:45,977 --> 01:01:48,444
I wish you'd said that
long ago.

999
01:01:48,510 --> 01:01:50,244
Why?

1000
01:01:50,344 --> 01:01:52,377
It's too late now, Bert.

1001
01:01:52,444 --> 01:01:55,349
I'm in love
with somebody else.

1002
01:01:55,350 --> 01:01:58,050
If you had told it to me
like that six months ago,

1003
01:01:58,051 --> 01:01:59,719
it would've been different.

1004
01:01:59,751 --> 01:02:02,551
I wanted
to hear you say it.

1005
01:02:02,617 --> 01:02:06,351
Why didn't you
tell me then, Bert?

1006
01:02:06,417 --> 01:02:07,951
Who is it...

1007
01:02:08,017 --> 01:02:09,251
Reynolds?

1008
01:02:09,351 --> 01:02:11,417
Yes, Bert... Reynolds.

1009
01:02:15,084 --> 01:02:17,251
I learned something
going around with him.

1010
01:02:17,351 --> 01:02:20,090
On those weekends
with his family and all that,

1011
01:02:20,157 --> 01:02:22,257
I met different kinds
of people.

1012
01:02:22,357 --> 01:02:24,890
They're a whole lot different
from our friends, Bert.

1013
01:02:24,957 --> 01:02:28,357
They like music and art
and all that sort of thing.

1014
01:02:28,423 --> 01:02:29,857
Oh, I don't know.

1015
01:02:29,858 --> 01:02:32,725
It seems like a better
way to live, that's all.

1016
01:02:32,857 --> 01:02:34,990
So I'm going to quit all this.

1017
01:02:34,991 --> 01:02:36,924
I'm going to marry Joe.

1018
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:48,329
I understand, Anne,

1019
01:02:48,396 --> 01:02:51,629
and you're perfectly right about me
and the kind of life I'm used to living.

1020
01:02:52,763 --> 01:02:55,863
You'd be in for an awful lot of
grief if ever you married me.

1021
01:02:58,029 --> 01:03:02,263
I'd be holding out or pulling a fast one
on you before the rice was out of your hair.

1022
01:03:03,364 --> 01:03:05,964
I suppose if I caught
the iceman hanging around,

1023
01:03:06,030 --> 01:03:08,468
I'd ask for a cut
of his profits,

1024
01:03:08,569 --> 01:03:11,603
And as for the butcher...

1025
01:03:11,670 --> 01:03:14,736
well, wouldn't I look like a swell
smack-off in one of those aprons,

1026
01:03:14,803 --> 01:03:16,970
washing dishes?

1027
01:03:21,436 --> 01:03:22,970
No...

1028
01:03:24,036 --> 01:03:26,803
I'd be a flop
at this marriage business.

1029
01:03:26,870 --> 01:03:28,903
Now, if it was a racket,

1030
01:03:28,970 --> 01:03:30,270
nothing could stop me.

1031
01:03:34,742 --> 01:03:36,609
Oh, well.

1032
01:03:44,776 --> 01:03:46,909
Congratulations,
old gal.

1033
01:03:48,642 --> 01:03:51,242
I wish you all the luck
in the world.

1034
01:03:55,309 --> 01:03:58,313
What is it the disappointed
suitor always says?

1035
01:03:58,380 --> 01:03:59,748
Oh, yes...

1036
01:04:01,715 --> 01:04:04,083
"name the first one
after me."

1037
01:04:26,389 --> 01:04:29,389
What is it,
a wedding or a funeral?

1038
01:04:30,422 --> 01:04:31,955
Both.

1039
01:04:52,611 --> 01:04:53,478
Goodbye.

1040
01:04:53,545 --> 01:04:54,978
Bye.

1041
01:05:08,512 --> 01:05:10,446
How did you
like Europe, Bert?

1042
01:05:10,512 --> 01:05:13,217
Hmm... stinks.

1043
01:05:14,818 --> 01:05:17,052
I tell you, Bert,
this deal is a honey.

1044
01:05:17,152 --> 01:05:19,618
No big touches, but the money's
there in the grind.

1045
01:05:19,685 --> 01:05:22,185
After a year's layoff,
it ought to come in handy.

1046
01:05:22,252 --> 01:05:24,185
Sounds alright, Jerry,
but I'm not interested.

1047
01:05:24,252 --> 01:05:26,885
I can't get interested.
I don't know what I want, kid.

1048
01:05:26,952 --> 01:05:28,785
It's the greatest thing
in the world.

1049
01:05:28,786 --> 01:05:31,519
Did you ever see one of'em?
They're good luck charms.

1050
01:05:32,552 --> 01:05:34,418
I hope it brings you
luck, Jerry.

1051
01:05:34,419 --> 01:05:36,585
I don't know
how you can pass it up.

1052
01:05:36,586 --> 01:05:38,625
I can get them made up
for 2 bucks a gross.

1053
01:05:38,626 --> 01:05:41,526
I got a half a dozen stenos a $20 a week
that do nothing but look up deaths

1054
01:05:41,527 --> 01:05:43,494
in the obituary columns
all over the country.

1055
01:05:43,758 --> 01:05:46,258
Then I send out a swastika charm
addressed to the dead guy...

1056
01:05:46,259 --> 01:05:48,225
C.O.D. $3.50.

1057
01:05:48,226 --> 01:05:50,726
The dead man's family is so
touched by the fact that he

1058
01:05:50,727 --> 01:05:53,693
sent away for a good-luck piece
just before kicking off,

1059
01:05:53,694 --> 01:05:56,294
they keep the charm
and send me the dough.

1060
01:05:56,458 --> 01:05:59,391
$3.40 profit on each.

1061
01:05:59,392 --> 01:06:03,732
Not big dough, but what a volume.
What a volume. Pretty, ain't it?

1062
01:06:03,830 --> 01:06:06,430
I can peddle more
than 500 a week.

1063
01:06:06,717 --> 01:06:10,051
No, Jerry, I'm afraid
you can't drag me in.

1064
01:06:10,118 --> 01:06:12,385
I've been away so long
it all sounds strange.

1065
01:06:12,518 --> 01:06:15,951
Uh, why don't' you take a trip
to China or somewhere?

1066
01:06:16,051 --> 01:06:19,385
You can't do yourself any good
around here if you feel that way.

1067
01:06:19,451 --> 01:06:21,518
Maybe you're right.

1068
01:06:21,585 --> 01:06:25,451
Why don't you get married?

1069
01:06:25,518 --> 01:06:27,719
You got some
bright ideas today, kid.

1070
01:06:32,091 --> 01:06:34,024
Wait here.
I'll answer it.

1071
01:06:47,824 --> 01:06:49,924
- Hello, Anne.
- Hello.

1072
01:06:49,991 --> 01:06:52,091
Come in.

1073
01:06:52,157 --> 01:06:54,130
How did you ever
find out where I lived?

1074
01:06:54,197 --> 01:06:56,130
Well, I managed.

1075
01:06:56,197 --> 01:06:58,130
Sit down.

1076
01:07:06,597 --> 01:07:09,663
Well, little stranger,

1077
01:07:09,730 --> 01:07:11,664
How do you
like married life?

1078
01:07:11,731 --> 01:07:13,398
Alright, I guess.

1079
01:07:16,231 --> 01:07:18,168
You don't look very happy.

1080
01:07:18,235 --> 01:07:20,470
I'm not.

1081
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,637
You were a chump
for passing me up.

1082
01:07:22,704 --> 01:07:25,637
I always told you I was
a bargain at any price.

1083
01:07:25,704 --> 01:07:27,570
I have something
to tell you, Bert.

1084
01:07:27,571 --> 01:07:29,504
Something dreadful
has happened.

1085
01:07:29,837 --> 01:07:32,704
It can't be as bad as that.
Let me buy you a drink.

1086
01:07:32,770 --> 01:07:34,104
No, thanks.

1087
01:07:35,404 --> 01:07:38,604
Bert, Joe has used some
of the firm's money

1088
01:07:38,670 --> 01:07:41,170
in a deal he thought
would make him a fortune.

1089
01:07:41,171 --> 01:07:44,705
That's been tried before.
What happened?

1090
01:07:52,776 --> 01:07:56,476
It didn't work.
He lost it all.

1091
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:59,043
And now it's up to you
to get him out of it.

1092
01:07:59,110 --> 01:08:03,076
And this is the guy you held up to me
as so respectable, so straight and clean...

1093
01:08:03,077 --> 01:08:06,177
he and his father
and his books and his music?

1094
01:08:06,276 --> 01:08:09,182
And now you wake up and find out
he's an embezzler.

1095
01:08:09,249 --> 01:08:10,782
I've come to you
for help, Bert.

1096
01:08:10,829 --> 01:08:13,096
Because you're the only person
I know to ask.

1097
01:08:13,296 --> 01:08:17,196
I want you to loan me the money so that
Joe can make good his losses to the firm.

1098
01:08:17,597 --> 01:08:19,930
The books
are audited the 30th.

1099
01:08:19,997 --> 01:08:21,230
That's the day after tomorrow.

1100
01:08:21,297 --> 01:08:22,730
How much is involved?

1101
01:08:22,797 --> 01:08:23,730
$30,000.

1102
01:08:26,563 --> 01:08:27,497
$30,000?

1103
01:08:29,297 --> 01:08:31,230
Hmm.

1104
01:08:31,597 --> 01:08:33,235
That's a lot of money.

1105
01:08:33,903 --> 01:08:35,936
I haven't got it, Anne.

1106
01:08:35,937 --> 01:08:37,837
I haven't turned a trick
since you left.

1107
01:08:37,838 --> 01:08:40,704
I'm living on principle, and as you see,
the layout isn't so cheap here.

1108
01:08:40,936 --> 01:08:44,769
Well, I didn't know, Bert.
I thought you were still in the rackets.

1109
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:48,169
I quit when you did.

1110
01:08:48,203 --> 01:08:51,703
I couldn't go on without you.
I lost my punch.

1111
01:08:51,769 --> 01:08:54,402
- Where'd he get the money?
- From the firm.

1112
01:08:54,403 --> 01:08:57,436
Yeah, I know, but was it in cash or
did he juggle his accounts or what?

1113
01:08:57,504 --> 01:09:00,375
No, he took negotiable bonds
from the vault.

1114
01:09:00,442 --> 01:09:03,775
He has his own key, and he knows
the combination of the safe.

1115
01:09:03,842 --> 01:09:08,775
He's trusted there.
He's been with them for years.

1116
01:09:08,842 --> 01:09:11,042
I see.

1117
01:09:11,109 --> 01:09:13,842
He's with Werder & Lawrence,
isn't he?

1118
01:09:13,909 --> 01:09:15,842
Well, listen, Anne,

1119
01:09:15,909 --> 01:09:18,910
Tell Joe he can expect a visit
from me in the morning.

1120
01:09:19,976 --> 01:09:21,582
And...

1121
01:09:22,283 --> 01:09:25,083
have him take me to his own
private office when I get there.

1122
01:09:25,149 --> 01:09:28,382
- What do you plan to do?
- Never mind. Everything's going to be alright.

1123
01:09:28,416 --> 01:09:30,849
- Just tell him to expect me.
- But, what are you going to do?

1124
01:09:30,850 --> 01:09:32,316
Wait a minute.

1125
01:09:32,449 --> 01:09:35,282
Our partnership was
dissolved a long time ago.

1126
01:09:35,349 --> 01:09:38,016
I don't have to
tell you everything.

1127
01:09:38,082 --> 01:09:40,982
Go on home, Anne.
Don't worry about a thing.

1128
01:09:41,049 --> 01:09:43,349
Everything's
going to be Jake.

1129
01:10:09,522 --> 01:10:11,255
Where's
Mr. Reynolds' office?

1130
01:10:11,322 --> 01:10:13,260
First door to your left.

1131
01:10:13,328 --> 01:10:14,761
Thank you.

1132
01:10:24,062 --> 01:10:25,995
I didn't intend
to steal the money.

1133
01:10:26,062 --> 01:10:27,429
I meant to return it.

1134
01:10:27,495 --> 01:10:29,995
It's the sort of thing
that could happen to anybody.

1135
01:10:29,996 --> 01:10:34,463
It's happened to lots of guys.
They're up in Sing Sing now.

1136
01:10:34,595 --> 01:10:37,162
Anne said you could help me.
I'll pay you back.

1137
01:10:37,229 --> 01:10:38,535
You won't lose anything.

1138
01:10:38,601 --> 01:10:40,735
I can't lose anything,

1139
01:10:43,535 --> 01:10:44,968
because I haven't
got anything.

1140
01:10:45,035 --> 01:10:48,768
When you married Anne, I lost
the only thing I ever had.

1141
01:10:55,968 --> 01:10:58,768
Is there any more dough
in this safe?

1142
01:10:58,835 --> 01:11:01,701
Yes. There are bonds going
in and out the whole time.

1143
01:11:01,768 --> 01:11:04,307
Why?

1144
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:06,341
Just this:

1145
01:11:09,241 --> 01:11:11,241
if this place should
happen to be robbed,

1146
01:11:11,242 --> 01:11:14,576
tonight for instance, and the
rest of the securities stolen,

1147
01:11:14,577 --> 01:11:17,877
they would never know that your $30,000
wasn't taken with the rest, would they?

1148
01:11:18,674 --> 01:11:21,242
Why, no,
they wouldn't...

1149
01:11:21,743 --> 01:11:24,375
- But that's robbery.
- Hmm.

1150
01:11:24,776 --> 01:11:26,076
That would be too bad.

1151
01:11:26,077 --> 01:11:29,216
Well, there's probably $40,000
worth of bonds in the safe now.

1152
01:11:29,381 --> 01:11:31,548
Any negotiable?

1153
01:11:31,614 --> 01:11:33,014
Well, no.

1154
01:11:33,081 --> 01:11:35,448
No, of course not. If there had
you'd have grabbed those, too.

1155
01:11:35,614 --> 01:11:38,648
- Look here, you...
- Shut up! Listen to me.

1156
01:11:39,414 --> 01:11:42,381
Give me the keys to this place
and the combination to the safe.

1157
01:11:42,448 --> 01:11:44,714
Go on home
and forget you ever saw me.

1158
01:11:44,781 --> 01:11:48,881
Take Anne out somewhere and be sure that
you're seen by a lot of people whom you know,

1159
01:11:48,882 --> 01:11:50,282
in case you do need an alibi.

1160
01:11:50,414 --> 01:11:53,654
In the morning, they'll find the
place robbed and the safe open.

1161
01:11:53,655 --> 01:11:56,922
They'll pick $40,000 worth of
non-negotiable bonds lying in the alley.

1162
01:11:57,054 --> 01:11:59,020
They'll figure that the thieves
threw them there,

1163
01:11:59,087 --> 01:12:01,354
keeping only the stuff
they could dispose of.

1164
01:12:01,420 --> 01:12:04,887
That's great. I don't know
how to thank you.

1165
01:12:04,954 --> 01:12:09,387
I'm not doing it for you, I'm doing it
for Anne, you smack-off.

1166
01:12:09,454 --> 01:12:10,920
Give me the keys.

1167
01:12:18,493 --> 01:12:20,860
Here's the combination
to the safe.

1168
01:12:24,261 --> 01:12:25,561
You put it down.

1169
01:12:27,827 --> 01:12:31,027
Not taking any chances,
are you?

1170
01:12:31,094 --> 01:12:34,827
Left 9-7.

1171
01:12:34,894 --> 01:12:38,527
Right 2-3.

1172
01:13:50,346 --> 01:13:51,313
That's him.

1173
01:14:01,052 --> 01:14:02,319
Stick them up.

1174
01:14:04,686 --> 01:14:07,652
Swing around there.

1175
01:14:11,652 --> 01:14:13,652
Alright, Joe,
frisk him.

1176
01:14:28,058 --> 01:14:29,726
Follow that brown sedan.

1177
01:16:05,951 --> 01:16:08,218
You can only stay
a few minutes.

1178
01:16:11,351 --> 01:16:12,484
Hello, Anne.

1179
01:16:20,584 --> 01:16:23,518
Hiya, honey.

1180
01:16:26,118 --> 01:16:31,990
Gee, it's swell
to see you, Anne.

1181
01:16:32,057 --> 01:16:34,491
Oh, come on,
come on, darling.

1182
01:16:34,558 --> 01:16:38,358
Don't take it so hard.
Things could be worse.

1183
01:16:38,425 --> 01:16:40,791
Oh, nothing
could be worse.

1184
01:16:40,858 --> 01:16:43,158
What do you mean?

1185
01:16:43,225 --> 01:16:44,358
What's happened?

1186
01:16:44,425 --> 01:16:47,058
I just found out
that Joe double-crossed you.

1187
01:16:47,125 --> 01:16:48,825
Double-crossed me? How?

1188
01:16:48,891 --> 01:16:50,991
Oh, don't you understand?
That's why you're here.

1189
01:16:51,058 --> 01:16:53,764
He had the cops
waiting for you.

1190
01:16:54,831 --> 01:16:58,331
You mean to say that after all we tried to do
for that guy he'd pull something like that?

1191
01:16:58,397 --> 01:17:00,697
Oh, it's impossible, Anne.
Nobody could be so low.

1192
01:17:00,764 --> 01:17:04,331
Oh, it's not impossible.
It's true.

1193
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:10,197
Oh, that dirty,
double-crossing rat.

1194
01:17:10,331 --> 01:17:13,497
I'd like to get my hooks on him.
I'd tear him to pieces.

1195
01:17:15,464 --> 01:17:16,897
Oh, if I could
only get out of here.

1196
01:17:16,898 --> 01:17:19,204
You're not going to take the blame.
I'm not gonna do it.

1197
01:17:19,237 --> 01:17:21,870
I'm going to district attorney
and tell'em the whole story.

1198
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:25,171
No, you mustn't do that.
You'll only put yourself in a spot.

1199
01:17:25,172 --> 01:17:27,172
I'm not thinking
of myself, Bert. It's you.

1200
01:17:27,403 --> 01:17:30,403
I got you into this mess.
I'm going to get you out.

1201
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:33,304
Stay out of this,
or they'll find out about us.

1202
01:17:33,437 --> 01:17:35,670
I can't let you go
to jail.

1203
01:17:35,737 --> 01:17:37,671
Anne, I'm in.
You can't help me.

1204
01:17:37,738 --> 01:17:39,738
It'll just be my word
against Joe's.

1205
01:17:39,804 --> 01:17:41,671
Oh, I've got to do something.

1206
01:17:41,738 --> 01:17:45,477
There's nothing you can do.
Besides, you don't owe me a thing.

1207
01:17:45,544 --> 01:17:47,644
I got you started in this mess
when I talked you into the rackets.

1208
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:50,344
Well, I'm not going to
let you take the blame.

1209
01:17:50,410 --> 01:17:52,644
I went into this thing
with my eyes open

1210
01:17:52,710 --> 01:17:54,844
because I loved you, Bert.

1211
01:17:54,910 --> 01:17:56,844
I always have,

1212
01:17:56,910 --> 01:18:01,444
but it's taken this
to make me realize it.

1213
01:18:01,510 --> 01:18:03,510
You mean that, Anne?

1214
01:18:03,511 --> 01:18:07,680
Of course I mean it, more than
I ever meant anything in my life.

1215
01:18:15,150 --> 01:18:17,216
Your time is up.
Come along.

1216
01:18:19,150 --> 01:18:22,550
Whatever happens,
no matter what it is,

1217
01:18:22,616 --> 01:18:24,383
I'll be waiting.

1218
01:18:52,923 --> 01:18:56,923
If I had the wings
of an angel, honey,

1219
01:18:56,990 --> 01:19:00,229
Over these prison walls
I would fly.
