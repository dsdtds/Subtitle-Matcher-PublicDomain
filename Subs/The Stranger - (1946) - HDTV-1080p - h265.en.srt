1
00:01:19,682 --> 00:01:20,890
Close your eyes...

2
00:01:23,765 --> 00:01:25,848
and place your attention on your breath.

3
00:01:28,557 --> 00:01:29,848
Breathe in...

4
00:01:31,973 --> 00:01:33,057
and out.

5
00:01:36,057 --> 00:01:39,723
Just put your attention on the breath
coming into your body as you inhale.

6
00:01:42,140 --> 00:01:43,390
It's clear.

7
00:01:45,307 --> 00:01:46,515
Nothing.

8
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:50,015
And as you breathe out...

9
00:01:51,348 --> 00:01:53,348
the air
that comes out of you is black.

10
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:57,515
And that black is any anxiety, stress,

11
00:01:58,598 --> 00:01:59,973
any worries that you carry.

12
00:02:02,182 --> 00:02:04,598
And as you breathe out,
feel it leave your body.

13
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:10,098
Breathe in clear air
and breathe out the black.

14
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:14,807
Breathe in clear air.

15
00:02:15,598 --> 00:02:16,542
Breathe out...

16
00:03:38,598 --> 00:03:40,307
There I am standing

17
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,598
in front of this old
nothing house, staring at it,

18
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:46,848
and this bloke comes over.

19
00:03:47,557 --> 00:03:49,848
And I recognize him, you know?

20
00:03:49,932 --> 00:03:52,223
Older, but I recognize him.

21
00:03:52,307 --> 00:03:55,890
I said, "It's me, Paul Emery.
I used to live in that house."

22
00:03:59,098 --> 00:04:01,765
And he goes, "No. No, you didn't."

23
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:06,890
I said, "You're Chris."

24
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,182
"Chris. You had that German Shepherd."
He says, "How did you know that?"

25
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,890
"We lived in this house for years."

26
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:22,557
- This old fellow...
- You heading to WA for work?

27
00:04:24,182 --> 00:04:25,598
No.

28
00:04:27,223 --> 00:04:28,890
Never actually been there before.

29
00:04:29,765 --> 00:04:30,765
Yourself?

30
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:33,682
Home. Headed home.

31
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,223
No, I just had to, uh, clear out...

32
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,807
Clear out of Queensland.

33
00:04:46,807 --> 00:04:48,890
Sort myself a car.

34
00:04:48,973 --> 00:04:51,182
Some place to stay and that.

35
00:04:55,182 --> 00:04:56,223
I'm Paul.

36
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:00,765
Henry.

37
00:05:20,307 --> 00:05:21,682
Turn her off again.

38
00:05:23,348 --> 00:05:24,348
And again.

39
00:05:28,015 --> 00:05:29,473
Yeah. Let's hear her, mate.

40
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:39,098
I need an address for
the transfer of ownership.

41
00:05:39,848 --> 00:05:40,848
Yeah.

42
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:45,223
- I can put down a motel?
- I don't know about that.

43
00:05:45,932 --> 00:05:49,307
- That's where I'm living. A motel.
- Can't put down a motel.

44
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:53,265
I've got a PO box you can use,
put that down while he sorts himself out.

45
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:54,515
- Okay.
- Thanks.

46
00:05:55,932 --> 00:05:57,015
Thanks, Henry.

47
00:05:57,723 --> 00:05:58,723
All right.

48
00:06:00,307 --> 00:06:01,307
$1,600.

49
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,682
- Here, mate. That's for you.
- Nah.

50
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,598
Come on, mate.
I mean, you really helped me out.

51
00:06:12,765 --> 00:06:14,515
No.

52
00:06:16,932 --> 00:06:18,932
What do you do for work, Henry?

53
00:06:19,473 --> 00:06:21,557
Everything I know is in my hands.

54
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:23,640
Can't hardly work now though.

55
00:06:23,723 --> 00:06:25,557
I'll be fucked in a few years' time.

56
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,515
And why's that?

57
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,140
Can't fuckin' breathe, mate.

58
00:06:31,682 --> 00:06:34,348
I know what it's like to be
on the other side of things.

59
00:06:35,265 --> 00:06:38,182
You got your last few fuckin' dollars
in an envelope there.

60
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:40,598
I see it all over you.

61
00:06:54,057 --> 00:06:55,265
Paul Emery?

62
00:06:59,723 --> 00:07:02,640
I can't, uh,
take your call at the moment.

63
00:07:02,723 --> 00:07:06,223
If you leave me a message,
I'll endeavor to call you back later.

64
00:07:07,348 --> 00:07:08,348
Henry, it's Paul.

65
00:07:09,182 --> 00:07:11,098
I need to talk to you about something.

66
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:13,640
I might need to shift out of the motel.

67
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,098
So give us a ring back when you get this.

68
00:07:18,223 --> 00:07:19,223
Okay. Talk soon.

69
00:07:28,973 --> 00:07:33,348
So it's just a bit further up here.
There's a house. You can drop me off.

70
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:37,682
All right, I have to tell you, Henry...

71
00:07:38,682 --> 00:07:42,515
I came out here
to do a job for some people.

72
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,515
And there's a mate of mine.

73
00:07:46,348 --> 00:07:50,098
Mark. He asked me if I knew anyone
who could handle a bit of work.

74
00:07:50,807 --> 00:07:52,182
I talked to him about you.

75
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,182
Yeah, just here is good.

76
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,140
Yeah, this is good. Just here.

77
00:08:07,223 --> 00:08:08,307
What kind of work?

78
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,015
I have to let him tell ya.

79
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,765
I don't do violence.

80
00:08:14,932 --> 00:08:18,223
No, Henry, come on. It's not like that.

81
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:22,640
We'll meet him tomorrow.
He'll tell you all about it.

82
00:08:26,723 --> 00:08:27,932
Have you dyed your hair?

83
00:08:30,015 --> 00:08:31,015
What?

84
00:08:32,098 --> 00:08:33,432
Have you dyed your hair?

85
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:38,015
Yeah, I just went a bit darker.

86
00:08:44,598 --> 00:08:45,890
It looks good.

87
00:08:48,432 --> 00:08:49,432
Thanks.

88
00:08:51,432 --> 00:08:52,598
Tell him we're on.

89
00:08:54,182 --> 00:08:55,182
Yep.

90
00:08:57,765 --> 00:09:01,640
Great. I'll see you tomorrow.
Thanks for the lift.

91
00:09:31,098 --> 00:09:33,307
- Where's Paul?
- He couldn't make it.

92
00:09:35,348 --> 00:09:36,348
Get in.

93
00:09:40,098 --> 00:09:41,098
Get in.

94
00:09:49,348 --> 00:09:50,515
Put your seatbelt on.

95
00:09:55,765 --> 00:09:56,848
I don't do violence.

96
00:09:59,057 --> 00:10:00,848
No. I've heard.

97
00:10:30,598 --> 00:10:33,432
Fat cunt.

98
00:10:35,723 --> 00:10:37,307
What are we doing here?

99
00:10:37,807 --> 00:10:38,807
Wait here.

100
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:43,807
How you doin', Mark? Good?

101
00:10:45,932 --> 00:10:47,265
Why'd you call me?

102
00:10:47,348 --> 00:10:49,432
Look, I've got your passports ready.

103
00:10:49,515 --> 00:10:53,265
They're all clean and unmarked.
And I'm so sorry I couldn't get the money.

104
00:10:53,557 --> 00:10:55,723
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry. Why?

105
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:57,265
I tried everything I could.

106
00:10:57,348 --> 00:10:59,473
- But...
- I'll get it for you Tuesday.

107
00:11:02,848 --> 00:11:05,348
By the way,
there's a girl shifting gear around

108
00:11:05,432 --> 00:11:07,182
out of Central Massage.

109
00:11:07,265 --> 00:11:08,265
Who?

110
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,932
You remember Letessia?

111
00:11:10,473 --> 00:11:12,057
- Who?
- Letessia.

112
00:11:12,473 --> 00:11:13,640
Oh, yeah, yeah.

113
00:11:13,932 --> 00:11:15,765
She's dealing out of the rooms.

114
00:11:16,890 --> 00:11:19,015
- Next week, Ken.
- 12:00 sharp?

115
00:11:19,098 --> 00:11:22,140
- What will you do? Thank you.
- Get your money.

116
00:11:22,223 --> 00:11:24,140
No carparks from now on. Fuck.

117
00:11:32,807 --> 00:11:34,932
Shift around gear. Is that it?

118
00:11:35,015 --> 00:11:36,515
No, we don't fuckin' touch it.

119
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:40,098
You don't use when you work with us, okay?

120
00:11:43,015 --> 00:11:46,598
I've heard that you don't have
many acquaintances, which is good for us.

121
00:11:48,682 --> 00:11:49,682
Works well.

122
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:52,765
'Cause you don't discuss
this work with anyone.

123
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:54,348
Open that.

124
00:12:06,223 --> 00:12:07,223
It's blank.

125
00:12:17,598 --> 00:12:18,973
It's just here.

126
00:12:22,265 --> 00:12:27,890
You know,
he's in, uh, trouble. Old mate. Paul.

127
00:12:28,765 --> 00:12:30,890
That's why they had to bring him out here.

128
00:12:32,473 --> 00:12:33,417
What's wrong?

129
00:12:33,432 --> 00:12:36,348
If he contacts you and it's not
through me, just let me know.

130
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,015
Don't you go tell Paul
what I said about him.

131
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:51,098
Where's your place?

132
00:13:01,432 --> 00:13:02,890
Little piece of fluff.

133
00:13:05,307 --> 00:13:06,307
Thanks.

134
00:13:41,473 --> 00:13:45,223
One, two, three, four, five.

135
00:13:47,223 --> 00:13:49,973
I'm a sworn member
of the Western Australian Police,

136
00:13:50,057 --> 00:13:53,223
conducting duties
at the Undercover Crimes Unit

137
00:13:53,307 --> 00:13:56,765
in the investigation into
the abduction and murder

138
00:13:56,848 --> 00:14:01,682
of James Liston on the 12th of May, 2002.

139
00:14:01,765 --> 00:14:05,098
Today's date is May 6, 2010.

140
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,890
My CO number is 452

141
00:14:08,973 --> 00:14:12,682
and I'm using the assumed name
of Mark Frame.

142
00:14:25,348 --> 00:14:27,473
Old mate, he called me last night.

143
00:14:27,598 --> 00:14:30,307
I let it go to voicemail
like... like you said.

144
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,723
Uh, he wanted me to, uh,
to collect this, though.

145
00:14:34,515 --> 00:14:35,723
Yeah, I'll take that.

146
00:14:35,807 --> 00:14:37,932
He's at a property
out of town for a while.

147
00:14:40,682 --> 00:14:41,807
What?

148
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:43,640
I thought I saw a car.

149
00:14:44,473 --> 00:14:45,598
What'd it look like?

150
00:14:46,265 --> 00:14:48,098
Ah, it's a van. It's turned off now.

151
00:14:52,098 --> 00:14:53,682
Hey, just hold on a sec.

152
00:15:15,307 --> 00:15:16,515
All right, Henry?

153
00:15:18,348 --> 00:15:19,890
Have you seen the sea?

154
00:15:24,765 --> 00:15:25,765
Hey.

155
00:15:29,057 --> 00:15:30,057
Hey, Gary.

156
00:15:30,098 --> 00:15:33,932
This, um, came for Paul yesterday.

157
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:35,932
Henry.

158
00:15:37,307 --> 00:15:38,348
Come here.

159
00:15:38,432 --> 00:15:40,307
This is Henry Teague.

160
00:15:41,432 --> 00:15:42,640
That's Gary.

161
00:15:46,057 --> 00:15:48,140
You can't come in here dressed like that.

162
00:15:49,057 --> 00:15:50,848
Get yourself some proper clothes.

163
00:15:51,682 --> 00:15:53,557
You look like a fuckin' criminal.

164
00:15:54,682 --> 00:15:57,307
Seriously, sort it out. Sit down.

165
00:16:04,098 --> 00:16:05,348
About Paul.

166
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:09,890
He has issues in the past
and we have to resettle him.

167
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:11,848
That creates an opening.

168
00:16:12,723 --> 00:16:14,223
We're a closed group.

169
00:16:14,348 --> 00:16:16,265
We don't often let people in,

170
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:19,432
and when we do, we take care of our own.

171
00:16:22,348 --> 00:16:24,140
How's that sound to you, Henry?

172
00:16:25,973 --> 00:16:28,265
Yeah, why... Yeah, why not?

173
00:16:37,390 --> 00:16:40,765
Look, Mark. I don't have enough money
to buy new clothes, mate.

174
00:16:40,932 --> 00:16:45,390
- I can't fuckin' afford that, you know...
- Ah, mate. Mate, shh, listen. Here. Look.

175
00:16:47,598 --> 00:16:49,015
Yeah, don't worry about it.

176
00:16:53,390 --> 00:16:54,557
I'll look after you.

177
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,473
See?

178
00:16:58,265 --> 00:17:00,015
Wait. I've gotta ask you something.

179
00:17:00,682 --> 00:17:05,098
That fella up there, Gary,
all right, he's the head here, okay?

180
00:17:05,182 --> 00:17:09,307
But there are people who he answers to
and they answer to people above them.

181
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:12,223
But he told me to ask you
if you'd done time before.

182
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:16,598
Yeah, I have, yeah.

183
00:17:16,682 --> 00:17:17,848
Mm-hmm. What for?

184
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,098
Been in and out
a few times, nothing serious.

185
00:17:21,182 --> 00:17:22,807
So no longer stints then?

186
00:17:24,890 --> 00:17:28,182
I did time for an assault
up in the NT, okay?

187
00:17:28,265 --> 00:17:32,432
That's why no fucking violence, you know,
because of the time for repeat offenders.

188
00:17:32,515 --> 00:17:35,765
If you've done longer stints,
just fuckin' tell me, okay?

189
00:17:35,848 --> 00:17:38,140
Don't wait for me to ask you.
How long for?

190
00:17:40,307 --> 00:17:41,473
Two years.

191
00:17:42,598 --> 00:17:45,223
It was at a family crisis center
and there was this fella

192
00:17:45,307 --> 00:17:48,098
who kept chattin' about my
fuckin' missus all the time.

193
00:17:50,223 --> 00:17:51,208
I went for him.

194
00:17:51,223 --> 00:17:53,432
He ran off into the trees,
I went after him.

195
00:17:53,515 --> 00:17:56,390
Yeah, I don't fuck...
I don't care what you done, okay?

196
00:17:56,890 --> 00:17:59,140
What I care about is
you being honest with me.

197
00:18:00,265 --> 00:18:01,515
Yeah. Be honest with me.

198
00:18:03,515 --> 00:18:05,473
That's all I ask, mate, serious. Here.

199
00:18:08,015 --> 00:18:09,015
Cheers.

200
00:18:10,890 --> 00:18:11,890
What?

201
00:18:13,598 --> 00:18:16,557
Just... Nothin', man. All right.

202
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:17,640
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

203
00:18:28,973 --> 00:18:30,057
Oi!

204
00:18:30,932 --> 00:18:32,390
What did you do?

205
00:18:33,723 --> 00:18:35,390
Get off the fuckin' table. Get...

206
00:18:35,473 --> 00:18:36,932
Here. Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

207
00:18:37,015 --> 00:18:40,182
Come here. Sit on the... Stand there.

208
00:18:40,265 --> 00:18:41,640
You've got bare feet.

209
00:18:42,557 --> 00:18:44,765
- What did you do that for?
- I didn't mean it.

210
00:18:45,432 --> 00:18:46,557
Fuckin' hell.

211
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,390
Can you just pay attention?

212
00:18:49,015 --> 00:18:51,515
All right?
If I cut myself, whose fault is it?

213
00:18:58,973 --> 00:18:59,973
Fuck.

214
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:03,348
What are you gonna do next time?

215
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:06,015
- Clean it up.
- No, pay attention.

216
00:19:07,140 --> 00:19:08,848
All right. Come here.

217
00:19:09,682 --> 00:19:10,973
Listen. Look at me.

218
00:19:11,098 --> 00:19:13,848
Sorry I sweared at you, all right?
Go put your shoes on.

219
00:19:32,765 --> 00:19:35,973
Hey, you want me to
teach you something I learned at work?

220
00:19:37,098 --> 00:19:40,390
Okay, you gotta close your eyes, yeah?

221
00:19:40,473 --> 00:19:43,223
Close your eyes and you gotta breathe in,

222
00:19:43,807 --> 00:19:45,015
and when you breathe in,

223
00:19:45,973 --> 00:19:49,765
you're gonna imagine that
you're breathing in really clear air.

224
00:19:49,848 --> 00:19:51,223
You gonna get out in a sec?

225
00:19:52,265 --> 00:19:54,432
And then when you breathe out, you're...

226
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:57,557
you're gonna breathe out all the black...

227
00:19:57,640 --> 00:19:58,640
Did you know...

228
00:19:58,723 --> 00:20:00,265
dark, bad air.

229
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:01,348
What?

230
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,640
That there's a frog that makes this sound?

231
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,557
And that's all the things
you don't like.

232
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,890
Up top. Oh, don't hurt me.

233
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,432
- I'm not trying to hurt you.
- Like when you're angry...

234
00:20:13,515 --> 00:20:15,015
You're getting it in my beard!

235
00:20:15,098 --> 00:20:16,848
or when you're scared and stuff.

236
00:20:16,932 --> 00:20:18,682
- Close your eyes. Trust me.
- No.

237
00:20:18,807 --> 00:20:22,432
Things you don't like
and then you breathe in the clear air...

238
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,682
and out the blackness.

239
00:20:26,473 --> 00:20:27,765
There you go.

240
00:20:29,557 --> 00:20:32,348
Your whole body's gonna relax

241
00:20:32,432 --> 00:20:35,890
from your feet, your knees,

242
00:20:35,973 --> 00:20:37,640
your hips,

243
00:20:38,682 --> 00:20:42,557
your stomach, your chest.

244
00:20:43,098 --> 00:20:44,807
In the clear air...

245
00:20:47,265 --> 00:20:48,167
out the black...

246
00:21:21,598 --> 00:21:23,098
Do you need a hand?

247
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:30,057
Sorry.

248
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:50,640
Ah, I'm just fucking with you.
You look good. Come on.

249
00:21:51,598 --> 00:21:53,682
Now he's gonna make me go shopping.

250
00:22:01,557 --> 00:22:02,557
Hey.

251
00:22:04,098 --> 00:22:05,348
Shut the fuckin' door.

252
00:22:07,432 --> 00:22:09,723
- What's going on here?
- Sit down.

253
00:22:10,765 --> 00:22:12,515
Hand over your phones.

254
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,223
What do you need our phones for?

255
00:22:15,265 --> 00:22:16,265
Unlock them.

256
00:22:18,723 --> 00:22:20,223
What do you need them for?

257
00:22:20,307 --> 00:22:22,807
We're deleting all of Paul's contacts.

258
00:22:23,348 --> 00:22:25,973
He's downstairs. Give him this.

259
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:27,557
John's taken care of everything.

260
00:22:28,223 --> 00:22:29,890
Have a drink with Paul

261
00:22:29,973 --> 00:22:32,098
and then we're taking him to the airport.

262
00:22:32,182 --> 00:22:35,265
And you, do whatever Mark tells you to do.

263
00:22:40,598 --> 00:22:42,057
There you fuckin' are.

264
00:22:44,848 --> 00:22:45,848
Sit down.

265
00:22:48,973 --> 00:22:50,348
- Hey, Henry.
- How you doing?

266
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:54,473
All right, there's ten grand in there.

267
00:22:55,848 --> 00:22:57,432
Passport's been issued.

268
00:22:58,473 --> 00:22:59,848
Ticket to the UK as well.

269
00:23:01,015 --> 00:23:02,640
And your visa's good for a year.

270
00:23:05,432 --> 00:23:08,682
Listen, mate, whatever this is about,
I don't want to know about it.

271
00:23:08,765 --> 00:23:11,973
We don't need to know.
You told John and that's all that matters.

272
00:23:12,557 --> 00:23:13,557
Okay?

273
00:23:14,015 --> 00:23:16,890
And he reckons it'll all be over
by the time you get back.

274
00:23:18,932 --> 00:23:22,515
We've all got a history, mate.
We've all got a past.

275
00:23:24,182 --> 00:23:26,640
And now you're nobody. Woo-hoo.

276
00:23:29,807 --> 00:23:31,015
Cheer up, man.

277
00:23:31,098 --> 00:23:32,515
I'm gonna get us a drink.

278
00:23:47,807 --> 00:23:48,807
Henry...

279
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:54,140
Trust Mark.

280
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:57,807
Trust Mark. Yeah?

281
00:23:59,432 --> 00:24:02,015
If you're honest...
If you're honest with these guys,

282
00:24:02,890 --> 00:24:06,390
you'll be looked after, mate.
You'll be looked after.

283
00:24:16,348 --> 00:24:17,723
What are we doing out here?

284
00:24:18,515 --> 00:24:20,432
We're making sure that Paul's clean.

285
00:24:31,098 --> 00:24:32,265
Who's John?

286
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:34,807
He's your employer.

287
00:24:48,265 --> 00:24:50,265
Sorry, I can be a bit of a cunt.

288
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:54,223
I've had issues myself in the past.

289
00:24:55,890 --> 00:24:58,473
This is the only family I've ever had.

290
00:25:01,682 --> 00:25:04,015
So, listen, if you have any issues,

291
00:25:05,265 --> 00:25:08,140
if you need help or what have you,

292
00:25:08,848 --> 00:25:10,473
just come out here and you wait,

293
00:25:12,307 --> 00:25:13,682
and I'll find you, brother.

294
00:25:32,598 --> 00:25:35,932
After the child
was abducted from the underpass,

295
00:25:36,015 --> 00:25:38,765
he was questioned several times
due to his record.

296
00:25:39,932 --> 00:25:41,682
He refused psychological testing.

297
00:25:42,557 --> 00:25:45,223
He stated he had a history
of violent offences.

298
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:47,598
There's an assault in the NT.

299
00:25:49,598 --> 00:25:50,723
Details aren't listed.

300
00:25:53,265 --> 00:25:57,807
We've been tasked P28
to reassess for the coronial inquest.

301
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:01,307
At the time of the abduction,
P28's file was closed

302
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:04,682
after detectives found
insufficient time or evidence

303
00:26:04,765 --> 00:26:07,223
for him to be considered
a person of interest.

304
00:26:07,307 --> 00:26:09,557
He has since relocated
to Western Australia.

305
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:16,223
We've been tasked with P27.

306
00:26:16,307 --> 00:26:19,057
He has a history of assault
and sexual violence.

307
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:22,098
His movements place him
in the region, the bypass road

308
00:26:22,182 --> 00:26:24,723
on the morning of the 12th of May, 2002.

309
00:26:26,723 --> 00:26:29,140
We're tasked with P26.

310
00:26:29,223 --> 00:26:31,890
He has a lengthy history
of domestic assault charges.

311
00:26:31,973 --> 00:26:34,432
There are currently four AVOs
ascribed to him.

312
00:26:53,265 --> 00:26:54,390
Mark.

313
00:27:07,432 --> 00:27:10,057
Thank you for everything
you've done on this case.

314
00:27:10,807 --> 00:27:14,348
It's your groundwork got us to this point,
so you should be proud of that.

315
00:27:21,057 --> 00:27:22,432
See you on the other side.

316
00:27:23,098 --> 00:27:24,432
Flying back to Queensland?

317
00:27:25,515 --> 00:27:26,515
Hey!

318
00:27:30,723 --> 00:27:31,723
We burnt your car.

319
00:27:39,182 --> 00:27:42,723
The decision is we can't have him
in densely populated areas,

320
00:27:42,807 --> 00:27:43,973
so isolate him further.

321
00:27:45,473 --> 00:27:48,973
Downside is we can't have
physical surveillance in remote areas,

322
00:27:49,057 --> 00:27:51,432
which means you'll be
unprotected and unobserved

323
00:27:51,515 --> 00:27:53,390
apart from the recording equipment.

324
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:58,765
The whole operation hinges
on you getting closer with him.

325
00:27:59,598 --> 00:28:01,182
I know you fuckin' know this.

326
00:28:01,807 --> 00:28:04,723
Don't find yourself in terrain
that you're unfamiliar with.

327
00:28:05,348 --> 00:28:09,265
Weigh the balance of the closeness you
could form against your own vulnerability.

328
00:28:41,390 --> 00:28:43,265
Fuck!

329
00:28:43,348 --> 00:28:44,557
I said wait in the car.

330
00:28:45,682 --> 00:28:47,140
You were taking ages.

331
00:28:49,432 --> 00:28:51,515
Could've been one of those silent alarms.

332
00:28:51,598 --> 00:28:54,057
Ah, I sorted that ages ago.

333
00:28:54,723 --> 00:28:56,265
Here. I forgot your brand.

334
00:28:57,098 --> 00:28:58,765
- Here you go.
- Thanks, mate.

335
00:29:00,890 --> 00:29:03,473
- Do you want a smoke?
- Nah. I quit.

336
00:29:18,932 --> 00:29:20,807
Do you want a smoke?

337
00:29:20,890 --> 00:29:22,473
Nah. I quit.

338
00:29:25,557 --> 00:29:27,932
I couldn't find a job
anywhere before this.

339
00:29:28,848 --> 00:29:31,432
You got a criminal record,
you're fucked these days.

340
00:29:32,307 --> 00:29:33,640
My dad was in the Army.

341
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:37,890
Thought about joining the Reserves myself.

342
00:29:38,723 --> 00:29:40,223
I did all the tests.

343
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:44,057
I failed the psych
'cause I fuckin' sleepwalk.

344
00:30:04,182 --> 00:30:05,598
Do I look like a monster?

345
00:30:05,682 --> 00:30:06,583
What?

346
00:30:06,598 --> 00:30:10,057
I can taste with my feet
and hear with my fur.

347
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,515
- What am I?
- What?

348
00:30:11,598 --> 00:30:12,848
A moth.

349
00:30:12,932 --> 00:30:15,307
You're a pain in the arse,
that's what you are.

350
00:30:16,057 --> 00:30:18,265
No, here, here. Here.

351
00:30:21,307 --> 00:30:23,182
All right, mate. See you Thursday.

352
00:30:27,182 --> 00:30:29,557
This is Detective Senior Constable
Kate Rylett

353
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,265
in the presence of Detective
Senior Constable Graham Ikin.

354
00:30:32,348 --> 00:30:34,307
We are carrying out a timing
of the movements

355
00:30:34,390 --> 00:30:39,057
of POI 28, Henry Teague,
on the 12th May, 2002.

356
00:30:40,598 --> 00:30:44,015
P28 claims to have left
his home at 2:50 p.m.

357
00:30:44,098 --> 00:30:46,265
and returned at 5:30 p.m.

358
00:30:47,057 --> 00:30:50,390
He drove along the bypass
towards a relative's house,

359
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:53,098
he parked and collected an engine part.

360
00:30:55,390 --> 00:30:59,057
He returned along the same road,
passing the bus stop at the underpass,

361
00:30:59,140 --> 00:31:03,098
where the victim was last seen
between 4:05 and 4:10 p.m.

362
00:31:04,723 --> 00:31:06,890
He claims not to have seen the child,

363
00:31:06,973 --> 00:31:08,557
but places himself driving past

364
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,682
at the same time the child was
observed by other witnesses,

365
00:31:12,223 --> 00:31:13,973
including those on a passing bus.

366
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:17,848
That bus wasn't taking passengers.

367
00:31:18,973 --> 00:31:21,848
It drives through
the underpass at 4:15 p.m.

368
00:31:23,432 --> 00:31:26,265
A number of witnesses
on that bus saw the boy.

369
00:31:26,932 --> 00:31:28,848
He was waiting by the side of the road

370
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:31,307
with a man standing behind him,

371
00:31:32,515 --> 00:31:34,640
leaning against a pillar of the underpass,

372
00:31:35,182 --> 00:31:37,973
his leg bent behind him like a stork.

373
00:31:41,390 --> 00:31:43,682
A second bus passes at 4:18 p.m.

374
00:31:46,348 --> 00:31:49,807
There are no sightings of either the boy
or the man from that last bus

375
00:31:50,807 --> 00:31:52,598
which means in those three minutes,

376
00:31:53,223 --> 00:31:57,265
between 4:15 to 4:18 p.m., he's taken.

377
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:20,557
He claimed that a camera,
angled at the road,

378
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,973
would've seen his car
driving through the site.

379
00:32:24,223 --> 00:32:26,182
That camera was not operational.

380
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,640
He... He's only placed himself at the scene

381
00:32:30,932 --> 00:32:33,473
because he thinks
he was recorded passing through it.

382
00:32:35,557 --> 00:32:38,598
P28 claimed he drove
through the site without stopping,

383
00:32:38,682 --> 00:32:41,557
proceeding directly to
the home of an elderly friend

384
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:43,557
with whom he spent the next half hour.

385
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:47,057
The alibi no longer resides
at her home address.

386
00:32:49,057 --> 00:32:51,515
When asked why
he hadn't raised the alibi earlier,

387
00:32:51,598 --> 00:32:55,182
P28 stated it was because
he did not want to upset her.

388
00:32:59,807 --> 00:33:00,807
Hello, Mari.

389
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:03,682
How are you today?

390
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:11,098
What was the period of time
you were hoping to talk to her about?

391
00:33:11,182 --> 00:33:12,307
We can't discuss that.

392
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:18,807
He claimed to have been with her
between 4:10 and 4:45 p.m.,

393
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:21,807
however, she's unable to confirm that.

394
00:33:24,765 --> 00:33:27,223
Forensic investigators
attended his property

395
00:33:27,307 --> 00:33:28,390
in the days following

396
00:33:28,473 --> 00:33:30,640
and conducted an examination
of his vehicle.

397
00:33:31,765 --> 00:33:34,640
Tape lifts were taken through
the interior of the car.

398
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:38,223
There's no record of the results here.

399
00:33:39,015 --> 00:33:42,557
Senior police considered him
an unlikely suspect regardless,

400
00:33:43,223 --> 00:33:45,973
as he did not drive
the "boxy black vehicle"

401
00:33:46,057 --> 00:33:48,390
sighted by multiple witnesses
at the scene.

402
00:33:48,473 --> 00:33:50,223
The conclusions were a lack of evidence

403
00:33:50,307 --> 00:33:53,348
and insufficient time for him
to have abducted the child

404
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:55,390
and returned home by 5:30

405
00:33:55,473 --> 00:33:57,473
to what he stated he'd been doing.

406
00:33:57,557 --> 00:33:58,557
Which was what?

407
00:34:00,057 --> 00:34:01,057
Cleaning.

408
00:34:05,557 --> 00:34:09,515
You know, when I was a kid, I used to ride
the cane trains all the fuckin' time.

409
00:34:12,848 --> 00:34:14,473
Out of my fuckin' head, I was.

410
00:34:20,515 --> 00:34:22,473
I never felt more free until now, mate.

411
00:34:29,432 --> 00:34:32,973
I reckon this is what
fuckin' real dreams are made of.

412
00:34:41,223 --> 00:34:42,223
You know Paul?

413
00:34:43,015 --> 00:34:47,265
When I first met him, I...
I didn't even fuckin' trust him.

414
00:34:47,348 --> 00:34:51,057
I thought he was a fuckin'
reporter or something, you know?

415
00:34:52,973 --> 00:34:55,182
With all the fuckin' questions
he was asking.

416
00:34:56,723 --> 00:34:58,390
That cunt couldn't be a reporter.

417
00:34:59,682 --> 00:35:01,057
He can hardly fuckin' read.

418
00:35:08,848 --> 00:35:09,848
It's true.

419
00:35:11,307 --> 00:35:12,890
He's a fuckin' dumb dummy.

420
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,140
- Done?
- No, not yet.

421
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,640
Hey.

422
00:35:45,598 --> 00:35:46,765
This is Henry.

423
00:35:51,932 --> 00:35:53,140
Here you go.

424
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:54,223
Good?

425
00:35:54,932 --> 00:35:56,515
- Yeah, you'll let me know?
- Yep.

426
00:36:03,057 --> 00:36:04,057
So...

427
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,723
Meeting him is a marker of trust.

428
00:36:06,807 --> 00:36:09,140
It means you've been brought further in.

429
00:36:09,765 --> 00:36:11,765
He's a detective senior sergeant.

430
00:36:12,557 --> 00:36:14,807
His influence goes right up
through the ranks.

431
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,557
If you ever see him out,
don't approach him,

432
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:18,640
don't talk to him.

433
00:36:19,473 --> 00:36:21,432
He's hooked us up with an arms contact.

434
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:24,348
We've got to go and meet him out of town.

435
00:36:30,473 --> 00:36:33,973
Two 1911s,
two Berettas, three Glocks.

436
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:35,890
I can do the lot for, like, 12...

437
00:36:53,307 --> 00:36:54,348
I like firearms.

438
00:36:54,932 --> 00:36:56,098
I used to collect them.

439
00:36:57,057 --> 00:36:59,265
Now it's antiques,
little trinkets like this.

440
00:37:01,307 --> 00:37:02,348
Oh.

441
00:37:06,307 --> 00:37:07,598
Who's Rylett?

442
00:37:09,015 --> 00:37:10,348
- Rylett?
- Mm.

443
00:37:11,265 --> 00:37:14,848
Oh. Rylett Holdings. Yeah,
I used to work for them back east.

444
00:37:19,182 --> 00:37:20,390
This is Kate Rylett.

445
00:37:20,473 --> 00:37:25,140
I'm after any archival video material
related to P28, Henry Teague.

446
00:37:31,598 --> 00:37:33,807
What was your relationship?

447
00:37:34,682 --> 00:37:36,182
We met through church.

448
00:37:39,598 --> 00:37:41,515
Why have you come forward?

449
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:46,432
Well, I don't...
I don't know about this case, but, um...

450
00:37:48,682 --> 00:37:51,932
but if a child's gone missing
and he was in the area, then I...

451
00:37:54,057 --> 00:37:55,098
think that...

452
00:37:57,223 --> 00:37:59,140
You think he was involved?

453
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:01,348
Yeah.

454
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:06,932
He drove us into the forest
this one night, um...

455
00:38:08,432 --> 00:38:12,265
And told me to get out
and pretend that I didn't know him.

456
00:38:12,765 --> 00:38:14,598
And... and then he's...

457
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:19,682
He's just driven off,
and he's just left me there. Uh...

458
00:38:20,473 --> 00:38:23,807
Then he's... He circled back round,

459
00:38:24,515 --> 00:38:26,598
he's pulled over to talk me into the car,

460
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,723
and then when I climbed in, he's...

461
00:38:30,432 --> 00:38:31,682
Ugh.

462
00:38:33,598 --> 00:38:37,515
He said, "You should...
You should be more careful who you trust."

463
00:38:37,598 --> 00:38:41,015
And then what happened?

464
00:38:47,182 --> 00:38:49,265
I used to be
a tow-truck driver, you know?

465
00:38:50,348 --> 00:38:54,057
Take the wrecks to... to be destroyed
down at the shredding yard.

466
00:38:55,515 --> 00:38:56,640
If you ever needed to,

467
00:38:56,723 --> 00:38:59,848
that would be a very good place
to get rid of a body, you know.

468
00:39:02,223 --> 00:39:03,432
If you ever needed to.

469
00:39:04,682 --> 00:39:06,015
They don't check the cars?

470
00:39:06,557 --> 00:39:07,557
Nah.

471
00:39:09,390 --> 00:39:11,390
A lot of fuckin' crosses out here, mate.

472
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:19,765
I used to be a member of
the church, back east. Yeah.

473
00:39:21,182 --> 00:39:22,723
A charismatic revival.

474
00:39:23,515 --> 00:39:24,598
Do you know the type?

475
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:27,458
Yeah.

476
00:39:27,473 --> 00:39:30,265
You shake and you flap about.

477
00:39:31,307 --> 00:39:33,265
Then they go into fucking convulsions.

478
00:39:49,723 --> 00:39:50,723
Eh.

479
00:39:51,807 --> 00:39:53,973
I had a falling out
with the pastor, though.

480
00:39:55,807 --> 00:39:58,557
He said there was
no such thing as an unforgivable sin.

481
00:40:00,348 --> 00:40:02,807
All sins could be forgiven.

482
00:40:04,932 --> 00:40:07,848
"That's not what it says in the Bible,"
I fuckin' told him.

483
00:40:09,682 --> 00:40:12,682
Standing up there,
preaching things that aren't fuckin' true.

484
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,723
Fuckin' lying.

485
00:40:17,848 --> 00:40:21,307
When we get there,
I'll need to go off and meet our contact.

486
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:24,723
You just hold there at the caravan park

487
00:40:24,807 --> 00:40:27,182
till I come back for you.

488
00:40:31,682 --> 00:40:34,932
Your recording device failed.
Take this one and hand me yours.

489
00:40:37,098 --> 00:40:40,140
You guys, you, you need to
back off further, all right?

490
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:42,432
You're following way too close.

491
00:40:42,765 --> 00:40:43,973
All right. You all right?

492
00:40:44,057 --> 00:40:45,932
You just...

493
00:40:47,140 --> 00:40:49,557
Just... just run me through
the fuckin' scenario.

494
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:51,182
There's no scenario, mate.

495
00:40:53,098 --> 00:40:57,057
Local police were alerted to activity
at the warehouse we planned to use.

496
00:40:57,140 --> 00:40:58,140
We had to clear out.

497
00:41:00,598 --> 00:41:01,598
Fuck.

498
00:41:05,348 --> 00:41:06,640
Henry!

499
00:41:06,723 --> 00:41:07,807
- Buddy.
- Henry!

500
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:09,557
Got to move out, mate.

501
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:11,765
Hurry up. Get your shit. Serious.

502
00:41:11,848 --> 00:41:13,807
- Quick! Anything else here?
- Yeah.

503
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,265
- No.
- All right.

504
00:41:41,015 --> 00:41:42,015
Do you, um...

505
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:45,473
Do you want to come up to the house?

506
00:41:46,265 --> 00:41:48,307
The missus is out of town at the moment.

507
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:15,682
Nice.

508
00:42:40,390 --> 00:42:41,473
Back in a sec.

509
00:42:56,682 --> 00:42:58,390
What does your missus do?

510
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:00,890
Oh, she...

511
00:43:01,765 --> 00:43:03,765
She suffers with anxiety and depression.

512
00:43:09,515 --> 00:43:12,015
She doesn't really leave
the house that much.

513
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:13,140
Oh, yeah?

514
00:43:31,932 --> 00:43:35,015
Bought that with the money
you paid me for the work last week.

515
00:43:43,848 --> 00:43:45,598
Where did you grow up?

516
00:43:47,348 --> 00:43:48,682
A lot of army bases.

517
00:43:57,140 --> 00:43:59,140
I'm the black sheep of the family, mate.

518
00:44:01,348 --> 00:44:03,723
They're ashamed of me.
Can't fuckin' stand me.

519
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:05,640
Why's that?

520
00:44:10,932 --> 00:44:11,932
I don't know.

521
00:44:20,348 --> 00:44:21,765
How old are you, Mark?

522
00:44:21,848 --> 00:44:22,973
Forty-six.

523
00:44:25,182 --> 00:44:26,890
- Nearly 50, eh?
- Yeah.

524
00:44:27,598 --> 00:44:28,598
Old man.

525
00:44:31,223 --> 00:44:32,223
Huh.

526
00:44:36,515 --> 00:44:38,640
What kind of music do you listen to, Mark?

527
00:44:40,682 --> 00:44:43,223
I don't really... listen to music.

528
00:44:45,557 --> 00:44:46,557
How do you mean?

529
00:44:48,557 --> 00:44:50,640
Well, I'm not really a song person.

530
00:44:54,432 --> 00:44:55,598
Yeah.

531
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,390
Hey, listen, um,

532
00:45:01,057 --> 00:45:05,432
there's preparations
for something that's happening,

533
00:45:06,973 --> 00:45:10,223
and I've talked about bringing you in.

534
00:45:10,973 --> 00:45:13,515
But it would mean travelling out of town,

535
00:45:13,598 --> 00:45:16,348
like, interstate, if you're up for it.

536
00:45:17,348 --> 00:45:19,640
I'm there, mate. I'm there.

537
00:45:20,682 --> 00:45:22,265
Brilliant. All right.

538
00:45:22,848 --> 00:45:23,848
I'll let 'em know.

539
00:45:26,932 --> 00:45:29,432
It's good to have a friend, Mark,
you know.

540
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:32,973
Someone you can chat to.

541
00:45:34,265 --> 00:45:36,265
- Yeah.
- It's been a while.

542
00:45:40,098 --> 00:45:42,348
We see through to the other side,
you and me.

543
00:45:42,598 --> 00:45:44,057
That's why we get on so well.

544
00:45:46,682 --> 00:45:48,557
Yeah. You're doin' good.

545
00:45:51,807 --> 00:45:53,765
Oh, fuck, I'm tired, man.

546
00:45:55,557 --> 00:45:58,307
I have a long drive back.
I'm going to have to head off.

547
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:00,140
Sorry.

548
00:46:02,182 --> 00:46:04,348
Um... It's a nice place.

549
00:46:04,432 --> 00:46:05,807
Mark, wait.

550
00:47:34,473 --> 00:47:37,307
Hey. What are you fuckin' doing?

551
00:47:39,223 --> 00:47:40,432
All right, enough.

552
00:47:42,723 --> 00:47:45,848
All right, one time. That's it, all right?

553
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:47,848
Hey, wait, wait, wait. Shake my hand.

554
00:47:48,348 --> 00:47:50,015
- Promise.
- All right. Okay.

555
00:47:50,098 --> 00:47:51,932
I'm gonna... How much do I gotta count?

556
00:47:52,473 --> 00:47:53,473
Uh...

557
00:47:54,140 --> 00:47:55,890
- Forty.
- Forty.

558
00:47:55,973 --> 00:47:58,015
Thirty? Thirty. I'll count to 30.

559
00:47:58,098 --> 00:48:02,140
One, two, three,

560
00:48:03,223 --> 00:48:07,265
four, five, six,

561
00:48:08,515 --> 00:48:12,473
seven, eight, nine,

562
00:48:13,973 --> 00:48:15,848
ten, eleven...

563
00:48:23,057 --> 00:48:24,932
You in here? Huh?

564
00:48:27,682 --> 00:48:28,682
Buddy?

565
00:48:29,473 --> 00:48:30,557
I'm gonna tickle ya.

566
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:34,557
I'm gonna getcha!

567
00:48:37,348 --> 00:48:38,598
Fuck are you?

568
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:41,390
Fuck.

569
00:48:42,182 --> 00:48:43,182
Mate?

570
00:48:44,848 --> 00:48:46,307
Mate, I'm fucking serious!

571
00:48:46,390 --> 00:48:48,348
Call out now if you can hear me.

572
00:48:49,682 --> 00:48:50,682
Mate!

573
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:53,723
Hey, where are you? Mate!

574
00:48:54,890 --> 00:48:57,015
- Mate!
- I'm here!

575
00:48:59,057 --> 00:49:02,015
- What are you doing out here?
- You said hide.

576
00:49:02,098 --> 00:49:03,932
You cannot come out here.

577
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:06,765
You don't go out here. What did I say?

578
00:49:06,848 --> 00:49:08,473
- Come here.
- You told me to hide.

579
00:49:08,973 --> 00:49:12,098
What did I say?
You don't go outside. Get in the house.

580
00:49:21,682 --> 00:49:23,057
Fucking feel this, cunt.

581
00:49:24,098 --> 00:49:25,307
Feel the wind in me hair.

582
00:49:25,390 --> 00:49:27,057
I can feel the wind in me hair.

583
00:49:31,140 --> 00:49:32,973
What is this fuckin' person doing?

584
00:49:34,890 --> 00:49:36,598
What's the matter with you, you fuck?

585
00:49:36,682 --> 00:49:38,348
Get out there, you fuckin' idiot.

586
00:49:38,432 --> 00:49:41,932
What the fucking matter with you?
Oi! Get the fuck out!

587
00:49:42,015 --> 00:49:43,765
Fuckin' drive, cunt!

588
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,140
Fuck!

589
00:49:46,182 --> 00:49:47,473
Fuck.

590
00:49:47,557 --> 00:49:48,557
Fuckin' hell.

591
00:49:57,223 --> 00:49:58,723
Fuck.

592
00:50:03,640 --> 00:50:06,348
- Police, fire or ambulance?
- Ambulance.

593
00:50:06,432 --> 00:50:09,515
What's the situation there, sir?
Can you describe it for me?

594
00:50:09,598 --> 00:50:11,223
Uh, car crash.

595
00:50:11,307 --> 00:50:16,098
Uh, corner of Ellery and...
Fuck, I don't know.

596
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:18,917
All right, sir.

597
00:50:18,932 --> 00:50:21,348
Can I have your name
and a contact number please?

598
00:50:22,140 --> 00:50:23,973
Fuck.

599
00:50:24,057 --> 00:50:26,307
- Henry!
- Sit down here. Sit down.

600
00:50:26,390 --> 00:50:27,375
Yeah.

601
00:50:27,390 --> 00:50:29,015
Henry, come on. We've got to go.

602
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:32,792
Henry!

603
00:50:41,307 --> 00:50:43,140
Do you want to come up to the house?

604
00:50:43,223 --> 00:50:44,515
No, no, no.

605
00:50:45,973 --> 00:50:49,890
They're... they're putting
the final pieces in place

606
00:50:49,973 --> 00:50:51,640
to fly us across to Victoria.

607
00:50:52,348 --> 00:50:54,682
- What?
- What's that noise?

608
00:51:07,348 --> 00:51:08,515
They're putting the final...

609
00:51:08,598 --> 00:51:10,682
I've never been to Victoria.

610
00:51:15,682 --> 00:51:18,515
Okay, I'm just gonna
need you to lay low.

611
00:51:18,598 --> 00:51:20,973
That's all...
I'm fuckin' tired, man.

612
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:24,515
All right? I'll call you later
with the details, okay?

613
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:40,307
No, no.

614
00:51:50,182 --> 00:51:51,723
I'm just fuckin' with you.

615
00:51:52,682 --> 00:51:53,807
I know.

616
00:51:55,390 --> 00:51:56,390
I know.

617
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:34,765
Are you, um,
dealing with any increased irritability?

618
00:52:35,682 --> 00:52:36,932
- Stress?
- Nah.

619
00:52:37,015 --> 00:52:39,432
Nothing that
you've perceived in yourself?

620
00:52:39,515 --> 00:52:40,515
No.

621
00:52:41,432 --> 00:52:42,515
Okay.

622
00:52:42,598 --> 00:52:45,223
Any physical discomfort,
anything likewise?

623
00:52:45,307 --> 00:52:46,307
No.

624
00:52:48,223 --> 00:52:50,348
Any symptoms of depression?

625
00:52:50,432 --> 00:52:51,417
No.

626
00:52:51,432 --> 00:52:52,848
How about anxiety?

627
00:52:52,932 --> 00:52:55,015
- Are you feeling anxious?
- No. No.

628
00:52:56,432 --> 00:52:59,515
And, um, how about any...
any thoughts of self-harm?

629
00:53:00,682 --> 00:53:01,848
No.

630
00:53:02,765 --> 00:53:06,932
Look, um, I do have, um, it noted

631
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:09,182
that you are dealing
with some sleep issues.

632
00:53:09,265 --> 00:53:11,223
Might it be linked to
your work with WA Police,

633
00:53:11,307 --> 00:53:12,307
or is that more personal?

634
00:53:12,390 --> 00:53:13,390
Nah.

635
00:53:15,348 --> 00:53:17,223
More to do with WA Police
or more personal?

636
00:53:17,307 --> 00:53:18,432
Neither.

637
00:53:20,098 --> 00:53:22,307
Mark, look, the reason that you're here

638
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:26,182
is I've been told you're being placed
in a difficult work situation.

639
00:53:26,765 --> 00:53:28,848
I've been asked to discuss that with you.

640
00:53:31,515 --> 00:53:34,098
You know, a person in this profession

641
00:53:34,932 --> 00:53:37,015
goes through enough...
goes through enough trauma

642
00:53:37,098 --> 00:53:38,932
that the aggregation of that trauma,

643
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:41,182
- the amount of it, is overwhelming.
- Mm-hmm.

644
00:53:41,265 --> 00:53:43,390
There's not always an isolated incident

645
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,848
or a situation that...

646
00:53:45,932 --> 00:53:48,140
I don't know what you're talking about.

647
00:53:48,223 --> 00:53:50,557
If you need to take some time off work,

648
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,765
there will be other people
that can take your shifts.

649
00:53:59,515 --> 00:54:01,932
Look, I need to talk to you
about the other night

650
00:54:02,015 --> 00:54:03,515
outside the front of my house.

651
00:54:05,432 --> 00:54:07,557
- Uh, no, Henry, listen...
- No, Mark, please.

652
00:54:10,265 --> 00:54:12,265
I used to watch a lot of porn, you know?

653
00:54:13,557 --> 00:54:15,182
Uh, amputees.

654
00:54:17,057 --> 00:54:18,182
That was my thing.

655
00:54:18,265 --> 00:54:22,890
You know, people with no...
no arms, no fuckin' legs.

656
00:54:25,473 --> 00:54:27,515
I don't know what it is about you, Mark.

657
00:54:29,307 --> 00:54:31,473
You... you remind me of an amputee.

658
00:54:33,140 --> 00:54:34,598
You keep talking like that,

659
00:54:34,682 --> 00:54:37,765
I'll have to take you down
to the fuckin' watchhouse.

660
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:42,473
What was that?

661
00:54:44,932 --> 00:54:46,515
Uh... Uh...

662
00:54:46,598 --> 00:54:48,390
I've got a black lake in my eye!

663
00:56:38,098 --> 00:56:41,307
You need to know that
I've told them that we cannot replace you.

664
00:56:41,848 --> 00:56:44,265
You've been on for five and a half months.

665
00:56:44,348 --> 00:56:46,932
We can't replicate that
and we can't undo that work.

666
00:56:50,265 --> 00:56:54,182
Flying you down to Melbourne
in the coming days.

667
00:56:54,265 --> 00:56:55,848
Victoria are providing coverts.

668
00:56:57,432 --> 00:56:58,932
That'll take the pressure off.

669
00:56:59,640 --> 00:57:02,223
We've heard nothing
about the assault in the NT

670
00:57:02,515 --> 00:57:06,390
and Forensics have come back
with the test results from his vehicle.

671
00:57:06,473 --> 00:57:08,973
The tape lifts they took
were never tested.

672
00:57:10,015 --> 00:57:12,723
They were submitted to the lab
where they were set aside.

673
00:57:13,223 --> 00:57:14,598
They tested them yesterday.

674
00:57:15,598 --> 00:57:17,473
Testing confirms no physical evidence

675
00:57:17,557 --> 00:57:19,890
of any other presence
in the fucking vehicle.

676
00:57:22,515 --> 00:57:23,682
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

677
00:57:25,098 --> 00:57:28,057
They noted that this,
in and of itself, is not conclusive

678
00:57:29,182 --> 00:57:31,432
and that at the time
the tape lifts were taken

679
00:57:31,515 --> 00:57:33,390
the person of interest was compliant,

680
00:57:33,473 --> 00:57:35,682
cooperative and understanding
of the process.

681
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,348
We have absolutely nothing on him.

682
00:58:02,682 --> 00:58:05,723
How's, uh... How's your mum?

683
00:58:09,390 --> 00:58:11,057
She said to not talk about it.

684
00:58:12,307 --> 00:58:13,432
Talk about what?

685
00:58:13,932 --> 00:58:14,973
How she is.

686
00:58:21,765 --> 00:58:23,557
- Hey, mate.
- Yeah?

687
00:58:23,640 --> 00:58:26,640
I'm not gonna be able to
take you for a few days, okay?

688
00:58:26,723 --> 00:58:27,625
Okay.

689
00:58:27,640 --> 00:58:29,640
- So you tell your mum?
- Okay.

690
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:40,098
There's a boy out there.

691
00:58:42,765 --> 00:58:43,932
Alone.

692
00:58:45,682 --> 00:58:47,265
Waiting to be found.

693
00:58:51,932 --> 00:58:53,473
And you know what he's saying?

694
00:58:56,807 --> 00:58:57,932
"Where am I?"

695
00:58:58,473 --> 00:58:59,473
"Where am I?"

696
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:03,473
"Where the fuck am I?"

697
00:59:55,015 --> 00:59:56,015
Henry.

698
00:59:56,598 --> 00:59:58,765
I heard this is
your first time in Victoria.

699
01:00:00,682 --> 01:00:03,390
Must've done something right
to be sent interstate.

700
01:00:04,182 --> 01:00:06,432
We're making a collection from a contact.

701
01:00:07,140 --> 01:00:10,182
You're taking it back with you to WA,
that's why you're here.

702
01:00:11,890 --> 01:00:12,890
Mark.

703
01:00:14,723 --> 01:00:15,723
Mark!

704
01:00:17,182 --> 01:00:18,473
John's here in town.

705
01:00:35,057 --> 01:00:36,057
Take this.

706
01:00:38,140 --> 01:00:39,598
- You wait here.
- Hey, Mark.

707
01:00:39,682 --> 01:00:41,598
Follow me through here.

708
01:00:44,973 --> 01:00:46,890
What the fuck's happened to this shit?

709
01:01:01,348 --> 01:01:03,598
Through here, mate. You all right?

710
01:01:04,223 --> 01:01:05,223
Yep.

711
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:07,307
Victoria have provided John.

712
01:01:08,223 --> 01:01:10,473
He'll be leading
the final part of the operation.

713
01:01:10,557 --> 01:01:13,098
But my concern is that
he's too direct for Henry.

714
01:01:13,682 --> 01:01:16,057
I need you to talk to him
about Henry's anxiety.

715
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,890
So we've gone after him
and we're racing down this corridor

716
01:01:20,973 --> 01:01:23,932
and he's locked himself in
so we thought, "Well, all right."

717
01:01:24,557 --> 01:01:26,973
"Wait for you to ask
to be nicely let out."

718
01:01:27,057 --> 01:01:28,515
John.

719
01:01:29,015 --> 01:01:30,598
- Do you have a minute?
- Yeah.

720
01:01:30,682 --> 01:01:33,265
Uh, Mark here's been
leading the operation in WA.

721
01:01:33,348 --> 01:01:34,890
Be good to talk to him about...

722
01:01:34,973 --> 01:01:36,765
Sorry, what was your name again?

723
01:01:36,848 --> 01:01:37,848
Mark.

724
01:01:38,973 --> 01:01:41,182
Yeah, but that's not
your actual name, is it?

725
01:01:41,265 --> 01:01:43,890
I mean they did tell you
not to use your actual name?

726
01:01:43,973 --> 01:01:45,182
Yeah.

727
01:01:45,265 --> 01:01:47,807
So what's your real name?

728
01:01:52,223 --> 01:01:53,473
What's your name?

729
01:01:53,557 --> 01:01:56,057
Well, it's not Mark. That's taken.

730
01:01:58,432 --> 01:02:01,057
Sorry. I'm just fucking around with you.
I'm sorry.

731
01:02:01,140 --> 01:02:03,515
I'll be with you in a sec.
I've just got to...

732
01:02:04,890 --> 01:02:05,890
So...

733
01:02:05,932 --> 01:02:07,223
He's a fuckin' arsehole.

734
01:02:07,307 --> 01:02:09,473
We've got him here.

735
01:02:09,557 --> 01:02:12,223
We picked him up,
take him down the hallway...

736
01:02:12,307 --> 01:02:17,015
We've been taking out insurance policies,
putting it through our claims officer.

737
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:20,182
Which puts it in our system...

738
01:02:20,265 --> 01:02:21,265
Mark.

739
01:02:22,223 --> 01:02:23,932
What do you reckon is in the case?

740
01:02:25,348 --> 01:02:26,807
You just have to trust him.

741
01:02:29,515 --> 01:02:32,807
Where is my water?
Where's my water?

742
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:34,682
Where is my water?

743
01:02:35,307 --> 01:02:36,890
Bloody hell!

744
01:02:36,973 --> 01:02:39,932
No, no, no, no!

745
01:02:40,723 --> 01:02:42,182
- It's him.
- Who?

746
01:02:42,265 --> 01:02:43,250
John.

747
01:02:51,973 --> 01:02:53,765
- You all right, Mark?
- Yeah.

748
01:02:54,307 --> 01:02:55,765
- Flight sorted?
- Yep.

749
01:02:57,057 --> 01:02:58,057
How are you, Henry?

750
01:02:58,098 --> 01:02:59,098
Yeah.

751
01:03:00,557 --> 01:03:03,723
It's really... nice to meet you,
John, yeah. Thanks...

752
01:03:03,807 --> 01:03:04,973
I'm not John.

753
01:03:05,973 --> 01:03:07,098
He's over there.

754
01:03:07,682 --> 01:03:11,348
He wants you to write down
your name and date of birth.

755
01:03:14,682 --> 01:03:15,932
Um, yeah.

756
01:03:40,432 --> 01:03:42,432
He said to write down your other name.

757
01:03:45,598 --> 01:03:48,473
- My other name?
- Yeah. Your other name.

758
01:04:31,473 --> 01:04:34,682
- I changed the name years ago.
- Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

759
01:04:34,765 --> 01:04:36,682
What's he want to know the name for?

760
01:04:36,765 --> 01:04:38,390
Why didn't you fuckin' tell me?

761
01:04:38,473 --> 01:04:40,765
They'll give your name
to a police contact,

762
01:04:40,848 --> 01:04:42,223
run a background check on you.

763
01:04:43,390 --> 01:04:46,140
We all have to get cleared.
Make sure we won't draw attention.

764
01:04:46,223 --> 01:04:48,307
Yeah, yeah,
don't fuckin' worry about it.

765
01:04:48,390 --> 01:04:50,057
I remember sitting where you are,

766
01:04:50,140 --> 01:04:52,390
thinking I'd never be let in
with the shit I'd done.

767
01:04:52,973 --> 01:04:54,807
- John wants to see you.
- What?

768
01:04:55,598 --> 01:04:57,307
John. He wants to talk to you now.

769
01:05:12,973 --> 01:05:16,807
I heard about you. Henry.

770
01:05:18,223 --> 01:05:19,432
Whatever your name is.

771
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,098
You've got to be honest with us,
all right?

772
01:05:23,723 --> 01:05:25,223
I... Yeah.

773
01:05:25,765 --> 01:05:27,723
I changed... I changed the name years...

774
01:05:27,807 --> 01:05:29,057
I don't give a fuck.

775
01:05:30,848 --> 01:05:31,848
No.

776
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,265
- What are you staring at?
- Nothin'.

777
01:05:39,265 --> 01:05:41,598
Then why are you still standing there?

778
01:05:51,348 --> 01:05:52,348
Thanks.

779
01:05:53,223 --> 01:05:56,182
Right. They've got us in different places.
Don't leave the hotel.

780
01:05:56,265 --> 01:05:58,932
There's nothing else I haven't told you,
apart from the name.

781
01:05:59,015 --> 01:06:01,432
- Nothing else I know about, at least.
- All right.

782
01:06:01,515 --> 01:06:03,223
Don't leave the hotel, Henry.

783
01:06:32,098 --> 01:06:34,557
I met this woman down
in the hotel bar last night.

784
01:06:37,348 --> 01:06:38,807
Brought her back to the room.

785
01:06:42,432 --> 01:06:44,682
You know what she told me before she left?

786
01:06:46,515 --> 01:06:47,515
Hm.

787
01:06:48,432 --> 01:06:50,348
"I'll never forget you, Henry."

788
01:06:56,432 --> 01:06:59,932
Fuckin' hope they've got enough ink
in the printer to print out my record.

789
01:07:00,015 --> 01:07:02,182
Eh, you don't need to worry about it.

790
01:07:04,432 --> 01:07:06,890
Ah, there's been nothing
in 20 years, mate.

791
01:07:36,265 --> 01:07:38,807
There were no records
of an assault in the NT

792
01:07:38,890 --> 01:07:40,098
under Henry Teague.

793
01:07:40,807 --> 01:07:43,390
They were filed under his
former name, Peter Morley.

794
01:07:44,598 --> 01:07:46,682
I provided them with the information,

795
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:48,640
but it was misfiled.

796
01:07:51,182 --> 01:07:52,307
Jesus Christ.

797
01:07:57,307 --> 01:08:00,348
I can't, uh,
take your call at the moment.

798
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:03,973
If you leave me a message,
I'll endeavor to call you back later.

799
01:08:10,140 --> 01:08:11,140
Henry?

800
01:08:14,848 --> 01:08:15,848
Fuck.

801
01:08:23,348 --> 01:08:25,015
- I've lost him.
- What?

802
01:08:25,098 --> 01:08:27,765
- I've fuckin' lost him.
- Did he follow you back?

803
01:08:27,848 --> 01:08:30,348
Uh, no, I don't know,
but I don't think so.

804
01:08:30,432 --> 01:08:31,432
Fuck!

805
01:08:32,015 --> 01:08:34,515
Uh... Listen, Mark.

806
01:08:35,765 --> 01:08:38,015
We can't put out an alert. You know that.

807
01:08:40,807 --> 01:08:42,932
There... there can't be a follow vehicle.

808
01:08:43,015 --> 01:08:45,598
I can't put out an alert.
You have to try and find him.

809
01:08:45,682 --> 01:08:46,667
What?

810
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:49,057
You're gonna have to
try to find him, mate.

811
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:50,640
Only issue is the alibi.

812
01:08:50,723 --> 01:08:53,598
Her daughter worked at a local RSL
at the time of the abduction.

813
01:08:54,307 --> 01:08:56,848
She said her mum was often there,
playing the machines.

814
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:59,723
Don't have security camera
footage dating back to 2002?

815
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:01,723
Not back that far.

816
01:09:04,307 --> 01:09:06,473
Do you keep records of your sign-in books?

817
01:09:06,557 --> 01:09:08,765
If she was a regular,
she wouldn't have to sign.

818
01:09:08,848 --> 01:09:10,640
What do you do for the regulars?

819
01:09:10,723 --> 01:09:12,890
We used to have a loyalty program

820
01:09:12,973 --> 01:09:15,015
where members could scan their cards

821
01:09:15,098 --> 01:09:16,973
and the machine
would record their numbers.

822
01:09:17,057 --> 01:09:18,723
How would we track down...

823
01:09:19,515 --> 01:09:20,417
Sorry.

824
01:09:20,432 --> 01:09:23,598
They shall not
grow old, as we who are left grow old.

825
01:09:24,223 --> 01:09:27,473
Age shall not weary them,
nor the years condemn.

826
01:09:29,807 --> 01:09:32,390
At the going down of the sun
and in the morning,

827
01:09:32,473 --> 01:09:33,723
we shall remember them.

828
01:09:33,807 --> 01:09:35,140
We shall remember them.

829
01:09:35,223 --> 01:09:37,640
- We shall remember them.
- We shall remember them.

830
01:09:47,348 --> 01:09:50,723
- Lest we forget.
- We'll have her number on file,

831
01:09:50,807 --> 01:09:53,640
- but the machines have been out of use...
- Where are they?

832
01:10:01,473 --> 01:10:03,140
What's the date you're after?

833
01:10:04,015 --> 01:10:06,390
The 12th May, 2002.

834
01:11:44,390 --> 01:11:48,765
I'm sittin' here with
the missus and just had ourselves a roast.

835
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:53,223
She says hello, by the way.

836
01:11:54,848 --> 01:11:57,682
"Hello, Mark," she's saying,
"Hello, Mark."

837
01:11:58,265 --> 01:12:00,223
Tell her I... Tell her I said hi.

838
01:12:02,265 --> 01:12:03,890
Mate, where... Where are you?

839
01:12:03,973 --> 01:12:05,973
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

840
01:12:07,348 --> 01:12:09,265
I had to head out of town for a while.

841
01:12:10,098 --> 01:12:13,640
Well, why don't I talk
to the boys, we'll work out...

842
01:12:15,557 --> 01:12:17,723
Yeah, he's anxious. He's unsettled.

843
01:12:19,807 --> 01:12:24,432
At this point, we feel that
we could lose him... at any time.

844
01:12:27,015 --> 01:12:28,473
We need to get John out here

845
01:12:29,265 --> 01:12:31,057
and prepare to make the final push.

846
01:12:37,682 --> 01:12:40,932
The interstate job
was in preparation for a larger shipment.

847
01:12:41,557 --> 01:12:44,307
Mark, here,
has put you forward for this, Henry.

848
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:47,307
And this is just the start, mate.

849
01:12:47,390 --> 01:12:49,723
This is nothing.
This is just a fuckin' run.

850
01:12:49,807 --> 01:12:53,348
It's a remote airfield,
hour-and-a-half out of town.

851
01:12:54,140 --> 01:12:57,723
John's concerned about security
and we need you to case the site.

852
01:12:59,682 --> 01:13:03,265
When the delivery is made,
you'll take 10% of the profit.

853
01:13:03,348 --> 01:13:06,515
To be clear, Henry,
that's over $100,000 each.

854
01:13:18,223 --> 01:13:20,348
I've been, uh,
doing the security down here

855
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:23,307
for nearly five years
and, uh, it never gets old.

856
01:13:25,182 --> 01:13:27,557
We're open to the public
on Sundays, by the way.

857
01:13:28,348 --> 01:13:30,848
Oh, right, yeah.
I might bring my boys out.

858
01:13:30,932 --> 01:13:32,682
Yeah, you should. They'd enjoy it.

859
01:13:36,265 --> 01:13:39,473
You like the look of that, eh?
You want to sit in the front seat?

860
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:44,223
I was 54 when I started.
I learned with my son.

861
01:13:45,057 --> 01:13:48,432
I had a fear of heights,
but, uh, when you get in here,

862
01:13:48,515 --> 01:13:49,807
it feels really safe.

863
01:13:50,557 --> 01:13:52,348
- Yeah.
- It feels very safe.

864
01:13:52,932 --> 01:13:54,015
It does feel safe.

865
01:13:57,765 --> 01:13:59,307
How much are these worth?

866
01:14:00,098 --> 01:14:03,807
Well, there's, uh, no ceiling
in the price of planes

867
01:14:03,890 --> 01:14:07,265
but, uh, that, um... that plane back there,

868
01:14:08,223 --> 01:14:10,473
that's, uh, $60,000.

869
01:14:26,723 --> 01:14:28,598
We've disproved his alibi.

870
01:14:28,682 --> 01:14:30,765
She was on the machines at the local RSL.

871
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:33,557
He couldn't have been
with her at the time.

872
01:14:35,223 --> 01:14:36,432
Where was he then?

873
01:14:39,182 --> 01:14:40,390
Not... not there.

874
01:14:44,265 --> 01:14:46,015
Have you seen the records from the NT?

875
01:14:46,098 --> 01:14:47,098
I'm reading them.

876
01:14:58,098 --> 01:14:59,390
Follow me, please.

877
01:15:37,848 --> 01:15:39,390
Take a seat. There's fine.

878
01:15:43,682 --> 01:15:45,182
I'm Detective Sergeant Cross.

879
01:15:45,890 --> 01:15:48,682
I'm the controller for
the Covert and Specialist Operations crew.

880
01:15:49,223 --> 01:15:52,223
I'm here to inform you
that at the close of the coronial inquest

881
01:15:52,307 --> 01:15:54,557
there'll be a UC sitting
next to your person of interest

882
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:57,057
on his return to WA. This is Paul Emery.

883
01:15:57,973 --> 01:15:59,098
- Hey.
- Hi.

884
01:15:59,182 --> 01:16:01,515
The intention will be
for Paul to make contact

885
01:16:01,598 --> 01:16:03,223
with the POI on his return trip,

886
01:16:03,307 --> 01:16:05,932
see where that takes us
over a two-week period.

887
01:16:06,015 --> 01:16:08,890
I'm afraid, unless they decide
to take it further, that's...

888
01:16:10,307 --> 01:16:11,307
That's it.

889
01:16:12,473 --> 01:16:14,723
You're here to brief us
about his background.

890
01:16:14,807 --> 01:16:16,890
- Right. But he did it.
- Mm.

891
01:16:21,098 --> 01:16:24,307
And I know they've probably told
you he isn't worth the effort,

892
01:16:25,973 --> 01:16:26,973
but he did it.

893
01:16:28,223 --> 01:16:31,015
Well,
we've only just been allocated this.

894
01:16:32,473 --> 01:16:34,765
Tell us what we can use
to get him to talk.

895
01:16:36,140 --> 01:16:37,807
Is this Peter Morley?

896
01:16:38,557 --> 01:16:39,557
No.

897
01:16:39,973 --> 01:16:43,057
Is this Peter Morley,
otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague?

898
01:16:44,557 --> 01:16:45,973
Who's this?

899
01:16:46,057 --> 01:16:47,265
My name's Kate Rylett.

900
01:16:48,348 --> 01:16:50,682
I'm a detective senior constable
in Queensland.

901
01:16:51,515 --> 01:16:53,890
As the detectives would've informed you,

902
01:16:53,973 --> 01:16:58,140
you've been summonsed to appear
at a coronial inquest in Queensland...

903
01:16:58,223 --> 01:16:59,208
Henry Teague.

904
01:16:59,223 --> 01:17:04,057
into the suspected abduction
and murder of James Liston in 2002.

905
01:17:05,557 --> 01:17:07,473
I'm going to give you my phone number.

906
01:17:08,015 --> 01:17:10,682
I'll be your point of contact
from here on.

907
01:17:10,765 --> 01:17:12,432
And what if I refuse to come?

908
01:17:12,515 --> 01:17:14,015
If you don't want to come,

909
01:17:14,098 --> 01:17:16,848
the Queensland coroner
will issue a warrant

910
01:17:16,932 --> 01:17:20,515
for you to be taken into custody
and brought before the inquest.

911
01:17:22,390 --> 01:17:25,265
After the inquest,
we'll provide you with transport,

912
01:17:26,223 --> 01:17:29,598
as I understand that
you currently live in Western Australia.

913
01:17:30,390 --> 01:17:33,265
We'll ensure you're returned
to your place of residence,

914
01:17:34,098 --> 01:17:36,473
assuming you aren't required
to remain in Queensland

915
01:17:36,557 --> 01:17:37,973
at the close of the process.

916
01:17:56,473 --> 01:18:00,057
We've reviewed the brief
of evidence prepared by Detective Rylett.

917
01:18:02,807 --> 01:18:03,973
Paul Emery?

918
01:18:04,057 --> 01:18:06,807
And we can see reason
to invest WA Pol resources

919
01:18:06,890 --> 01:18:08,348
in your person of interest.

920
01:18:08,807 --> 01:18:11,390
You'll remain here as a controller,
work with us on this.

921
01:18:12,515 --> 01:18:15,432
We're initiating an operation
that would mean introducing Mark here

922
01:18:15,515 --> 01:18:20,973
as part of a criminal organization
that can relocate people, erase histories...

923
01:18:22,557 --> 01:18:23,723
offer him a way out.

924
01:18:27,682 --> 01:18:28,723
It's dark.

925
01:18:34,307 --> 01:18:35,973
I step out the front of my house.

926
01:18:41,807 --> 01:18:44,473
And I get this feeling
of lightness come over me.

927
01:18:46,057 --> 01:18:47,515
So I start to run.

928
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,015
And then I'm up in the air

929
01:18:50,098 --> 01:18:53,932
and I'm flying over the back fences
and the houses that I grew up in.

930
01:18:58,348 --> 01:19:00,932
Fixed-wing licence costs $10,000.

931
01:19:02,265 --> 01:19:05,682
Two $5,000 payments.
Hey, figure how useful I'd be, Mark.

932
01:19:05,765 --> 01:19:08,307
I... I could be landing on airstrips

933
01:19:08,390 --> 01:19:10,848
all over the country, you know,
making deliveries.

934
01:19:16,432 --> 01:19:17,432
Yeah?

935
01:19:19,390 --> 01:19:22,057
All right. We'll head over
to the airfield after that.

936
01:19:25,890 --> 01:19:27,890
We're going to go meet him out of town.

937
01:19:49,015 --> 01:19:50,015
Henry.

938
01:19:50,932 --> 01:19:52,015
Mark.

939
01:19:53,057 --> 01:19:54,223
- All right?
- Yeah, good.

940
01:19:54,723 --> 01:19:56,932
There's a car to be ditched.
Police have eyes on it.

941
01:19:57,015 --> 01:19:58,932
Make sure it's not parked where it is.

942
01:19:59,015 --> 01:20:00,348
I'll send you the details.

943
01:20:01,265 --> 01:20:04,098
Henry, there's, um...
I don't know if you're aware of this,

944
01:20:04,182 --> 01:20:06,640
but there's a subpoena
that's been issued for you.

945
01:20:07,723 --> 01:20:08,890
Nah.

946
01:20:08,973 --> 01:20:10,932
Yeah. Queensland Coroners Court.

947
01:20:11,015 --> 01:20:12,140
Are you aware of that?

948
01:20:13,682 --> 01:20:16,098
No, that's done. I went through that.

949
01:20:16,182 --> 01:20:18,015
No. This is different.

950
01:20:21,265 --> 01:20:22,890
Another inquest, is it?

951
01:20:24,057 --> 01:20:26,432
Yeah, apparently they have
some new information.

952
01:20:50,765 --> 01:20:53,015
- Can't let you hold on to that.
- Yep.

953
01:20:53,890 --> 01:20:54,890
Thanks.

954
01:20:57,973 --> 01:21:00,265
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

955
01:21:11,932 --> 01:21:12,932
What was that about?

956
01:21:13,015 --> 01:21:16,807
Uh... I was in the same area
when this person went missing.

957
01:21:17,473 --> 01:21:20,557
Police harassed me for it at the time.
Nothing came of it, so...

958
01:21:28,140 --> 01:21:29,515
How many times have I told you...

959
01:21:29,598 --> 01:21:33,098
If I'd known there could've been
another subpoena, I would've told you.

960
01:21:36,557 --> 01:21:37,557
What?

961
01:21:38,765 --> 01:21:40,265
Yeah. I am.

962
01:21:41,807 --> 01:21:42,807
What?

963
01:21:46,432 --> 01:21:47,432
Now?

964
01:21:50,307 --> 01:21:51,307
All right.

965
01:21:52,223 --> 01:21:54,432
Yeah, fuckin' all right. I'm doing it now.

966
01:21:54,515 --> 01:21:56,098
What is it?

967
01:21:58,057 --> 01:21:59,390
I've got to turn around.

968
01:21:59,473 --> 01:22:00,473
Why?

969
01:22:01,015 --> 01:22:04,682
The airfield is, uh, not on tonight.

970
01:22:05,765 --> 01:22:07,015
John's in town.

971
01:22:07,682 --> 01:22:09,807
We're gonna go, um...
We're gonna go see him.

972
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,682
It's probably about the airfield.

973
01:22:12,973 --> 01:22:14,473
Could be about the inquest.

974
01:22:15,098 --> 01:22:16,098
Huh?

975
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,640
It could be about the inquest.

976
01:22:19,390 --> 01:22:20,807
I really don't fuckin' know.

977
01:23:27,348 --> 01:23:30,515
Okay. Well done.
And I'll give you a call this afternoon.

978
01:23:30,598 --> 01:23:32,390
- All right. Take care.
- Hey.

979
01:23:33,140 --> 01:23:34,182
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

980
01:23:34,265 --> 01:23:35,640
- How you doin'?
- Good, good.

981
01:23:36,390 --> 01:23:39,348
- Uh, Henry, John. John, Henry.
- Yeah.

982
01:23:39,890 --> 01:23:41,307
- Good?
- You remember Henry?

983
01:23:41,390 --> 01:23:43,390
- All good?
- Yep.

984
01:23:43,473 --> 01:23:44,515
- All right
- Cool.

985
01:23:45,682 --> 01:23:47,057
- Take a seat.
- Yep.

986
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:49,598
Yeah. Grab yourself a seat. There, there.

987
01:23:49,682 --> 01:23:51,598
Park yourself up the end there, Henry.

988
01:24:02,682 --> 01:24:05,515
So, I, uh, actually need to

989
01:24:06,515 --> 01:24:10,807
talk to you about this inquest
that you've heard told of...

990
01:24:11,765 --> 01:24:13,348
Heard tell of.

991
01:24:14,307 --> 01:24:17,140
I just need to... to sort that out.

992
01:24:19,557 --> 01:24:21,140
Yeah, uh...

993
01:24:23,057 --> 01:24:24,473
Got a criminal history.

994
01:24:25,557 --> 01:24:27,057
Stealing, uh, bit of violence.

995
01:24:28,515 --> 01:24:29,500
Fuckin' hell.

996
01:24:29,515 --> 01:24:31,307
Uh... Hey, uh, let me...

997
01:24:31,390 --> 01:24:33,390
- Yeah, John, let me...
- Fuck's sake.

998
01:24:33,473 --> 01:24:35,182
Yeah, I'll sort it out. Hold on.

999
01:24:38,015 --> 01:24:39,000
I've got it.

1000
01:24:47,473 --> 01:24:50,057
I... I did time for the violence, you know?

1001
01:24:50,640 --> 01:24:52,307
I was upfront with Mark about that.

1002
01:24:52,390 --> 01:24:54,723
- Wasn't I, mate?
- Yeah, absolutely.

1003
01:24:56,390 --> 01:24:59,098
And I was questioned about
the other thing at the time.

1004
01:24:59,807 --> 01:25:00,932
There we are.

1005
01:25:01,640 --> 01:25:03,140
Nothing came of it.

1006
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:05,223
Sorry about that.

1007
01:25:13,307 --> 01:25:14,473
Excuse us a minute.

1008
01:25:34,098 --> 01:25:35,515
Where's he gone?

1009
01:25:36,723 --> 01:25:38,015
I don't know.

1010
01:25:41,557 --> 01:25:42,807
I'm gonna go

1011
01:25:43,640 --> 01:25:45,140
see what's going on.

1012
01:25:53,848 --> 01:25:54,792
John.

1013
01:25:57,223 --> 01:25:58,515
You okay, mate?

1014
01:25:59,473 --> 01:26:02,390
Wait outside. Wait in the hall.
I'll call you later.

1015
01:26:04,515 --> 01:26:05,557
Hey, we're, um...

1016
01:26:06,348 --> 01:26:08,598
- I should... I should be here.
- Mark. Fuck off.

1017
01:26:11,473 --> 01:26:12,640
Yeah. Yep.

1018
01:26:19,057 --> 01:26:20,057
Mm.

1019
01:26:21,432 --> 01:26:23,557
Yeah, all right, then. Um...

1020
01:26:24,890 --> 01:26:27,098
I'll see what he says.
I'll give him a call then.

1021
01:26:27,182 --> 01:26:28,348
I'll be right back.

1022
01:26:47,098 --> 01:26:48,682
Fuck! Fuck!

1023
01:26:54,765 --> 01:26:55,667
What's going on?

1024
01:26:55,682 --> 01:26:57,932
He's fuckin' falling to pieces
in there. Fuck!

1025
01:26:58,015 --> 01:27:01,015
Fuck. Hey, hey.

1026
01:27:01,723 --> 01:27:03,807
- ... who tell me...
- Fuck.

1027
01:27:03,890 --> 01:27:06,932
- ... that you're the one who's responsible...
- Fuck.

1028
01:27:07,765 --> 01:27:11,515
so you have to tell me
what we need to take care of.

1029
01:27:11,598 --> 01:27:12,723
Nothin' to tell.

1030
01:27:13,432 --> 01:27:18,515
Okay.
What falls on you falls on all of us.

1031
01:27:19,598 --> 01:27:20,598
All right?

1032
01:27:22,515 --> 01:27:26,390
So I received information this morning

1033
01:27:28,223 --> 01:27:31,682
that says you're the one... who's done it.

1034
01:27:33,098 --> 01:27:35,848
And I... I don't care what you've done,

1035
01:27:36,557 --> 01:27:39,848
whether you done him
or killed him or what have you.

1036
01:27:40,348 --> 01:27:43,390
I mean, there's...
there's nothing you can tell me

1037
01:27:43,473 --> 01:27:44,598
that's gonna upset me.

1038
01:27:46,057 --> 01:27:48,307
What I care about is being lied to.

1039
01:27:49,223 --> 01:27:50,167
I'm not lying.

1040
01:27:50,182 --> 01:27:52,682
You've had every opportunity
to be upfront with us.

1041
01:27:53,557 --> 01:27:54,807
And if you're gonna...

1042
01:27:56,515 --> 01:27:59,598
be dishonest in front of me
and say you had nothin' to do with it,

1043
01:27:59,723 --> 01:28:01,598
- that's not what I've heard.
- Yeah.

1044
01:28:02,473 --> 01:28:07,432
And I'd have no choice but to cut you out
and you'd be back to nothing.

1045
01:28:10,807 --> 01:28:11,807
Yep.

1046
01:28:12,390 --> 01:28:13,390
Yeah.

1047
01:28:15,807 --> 01:28:18,807
And if they put you away for this,
there's nothin' I can do.

1048
01:28:18,890 --> 01:28:21,640
And there's a...
There's a stigma, there's a...

1049
01:28:22,473 --> 01:28:25,057
there's a... a stigma about
this kind of thing inside.

1050
01:28:27,223 --> 01:28:30,390
So, you know, I can create alibis,

1051
01:28:30,473 --> 01:28:33,265
clear the site,
remove evidence, relocate you.

1052
01:28:33,348 --> 01:28:34,640
I mean, you've seen that.

1053
01:28:38,598 --> 01:28:39,598
All right.

1054
01:28:42,848 --> 01:28:45,973
Sorry. Henry, what was that?

1055
01:28:56,807 --> 01:28:58,682
I killed him. I killed the boy.

1056
01:28:58,765 --> 01:29:01,182
Jesus Christ. Fuck yes!

1057
01:29:01,265 --> 01:29:02,932
Well, you know,

1058
01:29:03,640 --> 01:29:05,682
you're gonna have to take me through it

1059
01:29:05,765 --> 01:29:09,182
'cause we need to know
what we have to take care of.

1060
01:29:16,265 --> 01:29:17,265
Uh...

1061
01:29:18,807 --> 01:29:19,807
Uh...

1062
01:29:20,473 --> 01:29:22,223
I saw him waiting at the underpass,

1063
01:29:22,307 --> 01:29:25,432
so I pulled the car over,
and started to chat to him for a while

1064
01:29:25,515 --> 01:29:27,390
and I talked him into the car.

1065
01:29:28,598 --> 01:29:31,223
Cops have taken the car, searched it,

1066
01:29:31,307 --> 01:29:32,473
came back with nothin'.

1067
01:29:33,098 --> 01:29:35,057
They haven't found the body, obviously.

1068
01:29:35,807 --> 01:29:38,348
And where did this happen?

1069
01:29:38,973 --> 01:29:39,973
Just, um...

1070
01:29:50,807 --> 01:29:51,807
What happened?

1071
01:29:53,890 --> 01:29:55,848
John said we've got to go and fuckin'

1072
01:29:56,348 --> 01:29:58,098
wait there in my fuckin' car.

1073
01:29:59,140 --> 01:30:00,557
What? What is it?

1074
01:30:01,057 --> 01:30:03,557
Nothin'. I don't know. Fuck. Uh...

1075
01:30:04,390 --> 01:30:07,015
Just put the work on hold
for a while or something, um,

1076
01:30:07,098 --> 01:30:08,723
while he sorts a few things out.

1077
01:30:08,807 --> 01:30:11,348
- You told him about the airfield?
- Yeah.

1078
01:30:12,265 --> 01:30:15,015
Look, I don't know how much
I can tell you, man, all right?

1079
01:30:20,557 --> 01:30:22,807
He was dead before anyone
knew he was missing.

1080
01:30:24,223 --> 01:30:25,723
Before the police were called.

1081
01:30:26,640 --> 01:30:29,223
Before his family even
started looking, he was dead.

1082
01:30:30,432 --> 01:30:34,057
Detectives will regroup in Queensland
to determine if arrest will be made.

1083
01:30:35,390 --> 01:30:39,348
The undercover operation will continue
with Detective Sergeant Cross

1084
01:30:39,432 --> 01:30:42,057
to return the suspect
to the scene of the offence.

1085
01:30:43,223 --> 01:30:47,473
The site itself will need to be contained
in preparation for a search for evidence.

1086
01:30:49,140 --> 01:30:51,890
Henry,
I'm what's referred to as a cleaner.

1087
01:30:52,473 --> 01:30:55,848
The organization's brought me in
to ensure the police can find nothing

1088
01:30:55,932 --> 01:30:58,557
that could be brought against
you at this new inquest.

1089
01:30:59,057 --> 01:31:02,265
So talk me through it all
and I'll decide the right course for us.

1090
01:31:02,348 --> 01:31:05,015
I read all the press
and reports and that.

1091
01:31:05,807 --> 01:31:08,307
It wasn't a black car,
it wasn't two... two men.

1092
01:31:08,890 --> 01:31:09,833
I was on me own.

1093
01:31:09,848 --> 01:31:13,057
I didn't park at the overpass,
I parked behind it at my old church.

1094
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:14,848
It happened in an old demountable.

1095
01:31:15,390 --> 01:31:16,390
Uh...

1096
01:31:16,765 --> 01:31:19,223
So here, it's, uh,
about an hour and a half

1097
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:21,348
north of the city, out in the mountains.

1098
01:31:21,432 --> 01:31:24,182
- It was an old forestry site.
- Where is the demountable?

1099
01:31:26,015 --> 01:31:29,223
Uh, they took it away when...
when they closed the site.

1100
01:31:32,057 --> 01:31:33,432
There's nothin' in it, so...

1101
01:31:33,515 --> 01:31:35,265
Couldn't there be traces in there?

1102
01:31:37,890 --> 01:31:39,057
No.

1103
01:31:39,140 --> 01:31:40,140
All right.

1104
01:31:42,932 --> 01:31:44,765
Well, what happened after he, um...

1105
01:31:47,057 --> 01:31:48,265
after he died?

1106
01:31:49,140 --> 01:31:52,682
I took him out a bit further, you know,
covered him up with grass, branches,

1107
01:31:52,765 --> 01:31:53,765
that sort of thing.

1108
01:31:53,807 --> 01:31:57,265
Left him there, went back about a week
or two later and he was almost gone.

1109
01:31:57,348 --> 01:31:58,348
What do you mean?

1110
01:32:00,640 --> 01:32:02,182
There were just little pieces of him.

1111
01:32:02,682 --> 01:32:04,557
No. No, we have to find everything.

1112
01:32:04,640 --> 01:32:05,807
What about his clothes?

1113
01:32:05,890 --> 01:32:07,348
I threw them in the creek.

1114
01:32:07,432 --> 01:32:09,890
- How long ago was this?
- About eight years now.

1115
01:32:09,973 --> 01:32:11,723
Why did you take his clothes off?

1116
01:32:13,140 --> 01:32:14,432
I don't know, Mark.

1117
01:32:15,932 --> 01:32:17,765
I suppose you had to get rid of 'em.

1118
01:32:24,557 --> 01:32:25,932
What have you done then?

1119
01:32:26,015 --> 01:32:27,265
I went home.

1120
01:32:29,015 --> 01:32:30,015
How'd you do it?

1121
01:32:30,890 --> 01:32:32,848
- How do you mean?
- How'd you kill him?

1122
01:32:34,348 --> 01:32:36,932
- I put my arm around his neck.
- Right. Show us on Mark.

1123
01:32:37,015 --> 01:32:41,057
Mark, can you just pop yourself down
and we'll take a look at that.

1124
01:32:48,057 --> 01:32:49,765
All right.

1125
01:33:07,765 --> 01:33:10,473
All right. Yeah. It doesn't matter.

1126
01:33:11,348 --> 01:33:13,598
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1127
01:33:14,432 --> 01:33:15,682
Yeah.

1128
01:33:23,307 --> 01:33:25,390
- You need to take us there.
- Yeah.

1129
01:33:25,473 --> 01:33:27,557
- Need to clear everything.
- Can Mark come?

1130
01:33:27,640 --> 01:33:28,807
- Yeah.
- Ah.

1131
01:33:29,557 --> 01:33:32,557
It doesn't matter where we sit
as long as we're fuckin' together.

1132
01:33:33,390 --> 01:33:35,765
Like, you know, the same fuckin' row.

1133
01:33:36,848 --> 01:33:39,098
So the flight is sorted.

1134
01:33:39,973 --> 01:33:43,348
Uh, well, he'll call me in five
but I'm gonna go sort the car out.

1135
01:33:45,307 --> 01:33:46,307
Hey.

1136
01:33:47,432 --> 01:33:48,473
Henry.

1137
01:33:49,182 --> 01:33:50,723
Um, I'm gonna...

1138
01:33:51,807 --> 01:33:53,932
Mate, I'm... I'm... Come here.

1139
01:33:54,807 --> 01:33:57,682
Come here, mate. Fuck.
I'm just...

1140
01:34:00,223 --> 01:34:02,057
I'm so proud of you, brother.

1141
01:34:04,098 --> 01:34:05,265
Yeah.

1142
01:34:24,890 --> 01:34:27,307
This briefing
has been called to determine

1143
01:34:27,390 --> 01:34:29,932
whether an arrest
should be made of Peter Morley,

1144
01:34:30,015 --> 01:34:32,098
otherwise known as Henry Peter Teague,

1145
01:34:32,182 --> 01:34:34,807
in the abduction and murder
of James Liston,

1146
01:34:34,890 --> 01:34:37,723
eight years ago on the 12th of May, 2002.

1147
01:34:40,223 --> 01:34:41,432
As you're all aware,

1148
01:34:41,515 --> 01:34:44,890
this is the largest missing-persons case
in the history of our state

1149
01:34:45,598 --> 01:34:47,973
and is one of the largest
in the history of our country.

1150
01:34:48,057 --> 01:34:50,015
I'm going to the bathroom.

1151
01:34:50,557 --> 01:34:53,057
The investigation has
spanned over eight years

1152
01:34:53,140 --> 01:34:55,307
and is one of the largest joint operations

1153
01:34:55,390 --> 01:34:58,223
ever undertaken by interstate agencies.

1154
01:34:58,307 --> 01:35:02,140
Peter Morley was born to a normal,
middle-class military family.

1155
01:35:03,057 --> 01:35:08,015
There is no evidence to suggest as a child
Peter Morley was the subject of abuse.

1156
01:35:14,473 --> 01:35:17,557
This investigation
has completely disproved Morley's alibi...

1157
01:35:18,307 --> 01:35:19,890
He's just gone to the bathroom.

1158
01:35:20,515 --> 01:35:22,348
and has
unearthed the full details

1159
01:35:22,432 --> 01:35:25,973
of his previous assault of a child
in the Northern Territory

1160
01:35:26,057 --> 01:35:28,182
for which he served two years in jail.

1161
01:35:29,682 --> 01:35:30,682
Lights, please.

1162
01:35:35,598 --> 01:35:40,848
This child was taken from
a family crisis center in the NT in 1996.

1163
01:35:42,057 --> 01:35:43,723
He was not known to the offender.

1164
01:35:45,598 --> 01:35:47,682
Attending doctors observed that the child

1165
01:35:47,765 --> 01:35:52,932
had lacerations and abrasions
to his legs, arms and torso.

1166
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:58,140
His hair, face and body
were covered in dirt,

1167
01:35:59,015 --> 01:36:01,265
with blood present in the nose and mouth.

1168
01:36:02,473 --> 01:36:04,057
He had blackened eyes,

1169
01:36:05,307 --> 01:36:06,807
several closed fractures,

1170
01:36:07,640 --> 01:36:08,932
a collapsed lung,

1171
01:36:10,182 --> 01:36:12,307
severe bruises beneath his hairline,

1172
01:36:14,057 --> 01:36:16,473
and deep cuts to his scalp and genitalia.

1173
01:36:18,515 --> 01:36:22,432
The overall pattern indicated
widespread and repeated applications

1174
01:36:22,932 --> 01:36:26,432
of both blunt and sharp-force trauma.

1175
01:36:28,265 --> 01:36:30,265
Contusions to the throat

1176
01:36:30,348 --> 01:36:33,140
in association with
hemorrhaging in the eyes

1177
01:36:33,223 --> 01:36:34,848
was indicative of suffocation.

1178
01:36:35,973 --> 01:36:39,807
He was found barely alive
in the remnants of a burnt-out car

1179
01:36:39,890 --> 01:36:42,223
less than 100 meters
from where he was taken.

1180
01:36:44,348 --> 01:36:46,473
On returning to the site of the abduction,

1181
01:36:46,557 --> 01:36:50,473
Peter Morley offered to lead the search
for the person responsible.

1182
01:36:50,890 --> 01:36:53,015
Hello?

1183
01:36:55,265 --> 01:36:56,848
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

1184
01:36:57,557 --> 01:36:58,807
- Sorry.
- Nah.

1185
01:37:05,348 --> 01:37:06,557
Thought you'd fallen in.

1186
01:37:09,807 --> 01:37:12,515
I can't fuckin' breathe, man.
I can't fuckin' breathe.

1187
01:37:13,473 --> 01:37:14,473
- Yeah, you can.
- Nah.

1188
01:37:14,557 --> 01:37:15,557
Yeah, you can.

1189
01:37:15,973 --> 01:37:18,182
Ready?

1190
01:37:22,848 --> 01:37:24,723
I want to
raise a few issues here.

1191
01:37:24,807 --> 01:37:26,765
Regardless of his assault
on this other child,

1192
01:37:26,848 --> 01:37:28,723
in this case, the timelines are thin,

1193
01:37:29,598 --> 01:37:31,265
even with the break in his alibi.

1194
01:37:31,348 --> 01:37:35,223
We're talking about an hour
to abduct a person...

1195
01:37:35,307 --> 01:37:37,473
I have to be clear,
this is a practiced offender

1196
01:37:37,557 --> 01:37:40,432
- who's placed himself at the scene...
- You've been clear.

1197
01:37:40,515 --> 01:37:43,598
- You've had your time. Now sit down.
- I want to clarify something.

1198
01:37:43,682 --> 01:37:45,432
Let's have some contention in the process.

1199
01:37:45,515 --> 01:37:48,848
I want to clarify something.
The duration of the assault in the NT?

1200
01:37:51,015 --> 01:37:52,223
Fifteen minutes.

1201
01:37:57,723 --> 01:38:00,807
There's never been anyone
locked up in Queensland without a body.

1202
01:38:00,890 --> 01:38:02,973
New South Wales there has. Not here.

1203
01:38:03,057 --> 01:38:07,890
I, um... I mentioned the yard
where you talked about shredding the cars.

1204
01:38:08,307 --> 01:38:10,515
Is that somewhere that we should head to?

1205
01:38:10,598 --> 01:38:13,182
- Nah, mate.
- I just thought maybe...

1206
01:38:13,265 --> 01:38:14,348
No, Mark, no.

1207
01:38:17,223 --> 01:38:18,890
What were you wearing on the day?

1208
01:38:18,973 --> 01:38:21,973
I threw it all on the fire,
burnt it all, shoes as well.

1209
01:38:22,932 --> 01:38:25,640
- There's nothing left?
- Nothing left. Nothing.

1210
01:38:25,723 --> 01:38:28,640
- Where are the ashes?
- I threw them out on the lawn

1211
01:38:28,723 --> 01:38:31,348
and then I got the dirt
ripped up and taken away, so...

1212
01:38:31,432 --> 01:38:32,890
Fuckin' well done.

1213
01:38:32,973 --> 01:38:34,973
That's gold. Fuckin' gold.

1214
01:38:35,265 --> 01:38:38,598
I didn't mean to do it, though.
I didn't know it would happen.

1215
01:38:38,682 --> 01:38:41,182
It's like how the words
are coming out of me mouth now,

1216
01:38:41,265 --> 01:38:43,640
like how I'm saying it to you now,
like it's nothing.

1217
01:38:46,515 --> 01:38:48,890
- How far from here?
- Not far.

1218
01:38:49,807 --> 01:38:51,432
That's my old church there.

1219
01:38:51,515 --> 01:38:52,890
That's where I was married.

1220
01:38:52,973 --> 01:38:55,973
Don't know what I was fuckin'
thinkin' of at the time.

1221
01:38:57,057 --> 01:38:58,098
Yeah.

1222
01:38:58,182 --> 01:39:00,515
This is where I picked him up, here.

1223
01:39:01,682 --> 01:39:04,640
No, don't fuckin' pull over.
There's a camera there.

1224
01:39:04,723 --> 01:39:06,348
There's a camera there, mate.

1225
01:39:06,432 --> 01:39:07,515
Just keep going.

1226
01:39:11,265 --> 01:39:13,598
This isn't
about whether he did it.

1227
01:39:13,682 --> 01:39:16,390
It's about whether
or not it's prosecutable.

1228
01:39:17,015 --> 01:39:20,140
And you can talk about
an unsolicited confession all you like.

1229
01:39:20,223 --> 01:39:23,932
This undercover operation
induces a suspect to confess.

1230
01:39:24,807 --> 01:39:27,432
It's inducement without evidence.

1231
01:39:28,932 --> 01:39:31,057
This is where I threw his clothes.

1232
01:39:32,515 --> 01:39:33,932
There's nothing here.

1233
01:39:36,348 --> 01:39:37,348
That's good.

1234
01:39:39,682 --> 01:39:42,390
I strongly submit that we
continue the covert operation

1235
01:39:42,473 --> 01:39:44,057
while the area's being searched

1236
01:39:44,140 --> 01:39:46,515
because if you go for
an arrest without evidence

1237
01:39:46,598 --> 01:39:48,557
and you find nothing, he walks.

1238
01:39:50,390 --> 01:39:53,015
I refuse to put the victim's family
through that for nothing.

1239
01:39:53,098 --> 01:39:55,557
As you're aware,
the commissioner has tasked me

1240
01:39:55,640 --> 01:39:58,765
with making a decision as to whether
or not an arrest is to take place.

1241
01:39:58,848 --> 01:40:00,432
Without evidence, he walks.

1242
01:40:01,640 --> 01:40:03,890
And that will be
my decision to make.

1243
01:40:15,598 --> 01:40:17,140
Just pull in up there.

1244
01:40:24,890 --> 01:40:25,890
Is this it?

1245
01:40:29,932 --> 01:40:30,932
Yep.

1246
01:40:40,682 --> 01:40:42,890
So this is where
the demountable was?

1247
01:40:44,765 --> 01:40:46,890
- Yeah.
- So you killed him in there...

1248
01:40:49,640 --> 01:40:51,223
and you dragged him down where?

1249
01:41:33,640 --> 01:41:35,723
I don't remember that water being there.

1250
01:41:39,182 --> 01:41:40,390
It was here though.

1251
01:41:42,223 --> 01:41:43,223
Here.

1252
01:41:46,765 --> 01:41:47,765
You sure?

1253
01:41:57,473 --> 01:41:58,765
Yeah, there's nothing.

1254
01:42:15,307 --> 01:42:16,473
It's all right.

1255
01:42:19,098 --> 01:42:20,098
It's all right.

1256
01:42:22,890 --> 01:42:25,598
Hold it there!
Hold it there!

1257
01:42:25,682 --> 01:42:28,140
Stay where you are, mate!
Just stay where you are!

1258
01:43:44,390 --> 01:43:46,098
Thank you all for your attendance.

1259
01:43:47,890 --> 01:43:51,640
I'll let you know at the outset that
we won't be able to answer any questions.

1260
01:43:51,723 --> 01:43:54,098
I can confirm that earlier today,
an arrest was made

1261
01:43:54,182 --> 01:43:57,932
in relation to the disappearance
of James Liston on May 12, 2002.

1262
01:43:58,015 --> 01:44:02,098
Police are currently securing a large area
in anticipation of an extensive search.

1263
01:44:09,682 --> 01:44:13,390
The search area itself
is located in the Queensland floodplain.

1264
01:44:13,473 --> 01:44:17,307
The issue that we are facing
is that flooding over the past eight years

1265
01:44:17,390 --> 01:44:19,515
may have removed any remaining evidence.

1266
01:44:28,432 --> 01:44:29,723
Henry Teague.

1267
01:44:30,890 --> 01:44:32,348
As informed earlier,

1268
01:44:32,432 --> 01:44:35,390
you're here under arrest with regard
to the abduction of James Liston

1269
01:44:35,473 --> 01:44:36,640
on the 12th May, 2002.

1270
01:44:36,723 --> 01:44:39,765
I haven't done this, you know.
Nothin' to do with me, mate.

1271
01:44:40,390 --> 01:44:42,598
As long as you didn't do it,
there'll be no evidence

1272
01:44:42,682 --> 01:44:44,848
and you've got nothing to worry about.

1273
01:44:44,932 --> 01:44:47,390
Now, you got a minute.
Anything you need?

1274
01:44:48,473 --> 01:44:49,682
Anyone got a smoke?

1275
01:45:35,223 --> 01:45:38,557
We'll be undertaking
a basic search of the forest covering.

1276
01:45:38,640 --> 01:45:41,307
We have around four acres to manage.

1277
01:45:50,432 --> 01:45:52,973
Additional Forensics are
searching the demountable

1278
01:45:53,057 --> 01:45:55,223
which was relocated when the site sold

1279
01:45:55,307 --> 01:45:57,807
and where it's alleged
that the victim was killed.

1280
01:46:04,307 --> 01:46:06,307
Don't disturb potential evidence.

1281
01:46:07,098 --> 01:46:11,515
If you come across anything,
pause and raise your hand.

1282
01:47:24,307 --> 01:47:26,848
- How we looking?
- Found nothing.

1283
01:47:26,932 --> 01:47:28,015
- Nothing at all?
- No.

1284
01:47:28,098 --> 01:47:30,598
The divers have finished with
the lake, but no, nothing.

1285
01:47:30,682 --> 01:47:31,682
Right.

1286
01:50:24,557 --> 01:50:25,557
No, hold on.

1287
01:50:46,765 --> 01:50:47,973
It's night.

1288
01:50:49,973 --> 01:50:51,307
I'm in my house.

1289
01:50:53,390 --> 01:50:55,390
My son is asleep in his room.

1290
01:50:58,015 --> 01:50:59,432
And I hear a voice.

1291
01:51:01,390 --> 01:51:03,307
It's coming from downstairs.

1292
01:51:05,848 --> 01:51:07,140
I walk toward it.

1293
01:51:10,223 --> 01:51:11,640
I can barely breathe.

1294
01:51:14,640 --> 01:51:16,265
It's not a person talking.

1295
01:51:18,473 --> 01:51:20,265
It's a tape recorder.

1296
01:51:23,057 --> 01:51:25,098
I press the button to turn it off.

1297
01:51:26,973 --> 01:51:28,432
But when I turn it off...

1298
01:51:30,640 --> 01:51:32,265
the voice keeps coming...

1299
01:51:34,932 --> 01:51:36,098
keeps talking.
