1
00:01:51,196 --> 00:01:53,364
So you're John Longhorn eh?

2
00:01:53,573 --> 00:01:55,325
Well John, let's see.

3
00:01:55,533 --> 00:01:57,577
Yep, Uncle Sam has a nice, tidy

4
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,621
little something for you, John.

5
00:01:59,829 --> 00:02:01,790
The earnings and interest
on your oil lands

6
00:02:01,998 --> 00:02:03,708
amounts to just $4000.

7
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:06,961
Sign your name right here.

8
00:02:21,935 --> 00:02:24,646
Oh, Chris Morrell, step
up here will you please?

9
00:02:32,737 --> 00:02:33,905
Hello Nina.

10
00:02:34,906 --> 00:02:37,659
The money from Nina's mother's oil land

11
00:02:37,867 --> 00:02:39,661
is amounting to quite a pile.

12
00:02:39,869 --> 00:02:41,913
About $50,000 right now.

13
00:02:43,123 --> 00:02:45,708
If you can locate Nina's
father and get his signature

14
00:02:45,917 --> 00:02:47,463
to these documents, then Nina will

15
00:02:47,627 --> 00:02:50,463
still remain the ward of the
United States government,

16
00:02:50,672 --> 00:02:53,049
but you will be her guardian, legally.

17
00:02:53,258 --> 00:02:54,884
That ought to be simple enough.

18
00:02:55,093 --> 00:02:57,053
Or if you can bring
evidence or proof that

19
00:02:57,262 --> 00:03:00,890
her father is dead, then that
will clear the situation.

20
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:04,227
I've got a pretty fair
idea that he's still alive.

21
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:15,446
Well, what did you find out?

22
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:18,283
The half-breed kid's
worth 50,000 right now

23
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:20,493
and if Chris Morrell
locates the kid's father

24
00:03:20,702 --> 00:03:22,620
and he signs the papers
the agent give him,

25
00:03:22,829 --> 00:03:25,290
as her guardian Morrell gets $50,000.

26
00:03:25,498 --> 00:03:26,666
Oh, he does?

27
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:28,417
That is, if he gets to the kid's father

28
00:03:28,418 --> 00:03:30,044
before we get to him.

29
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,558
Where are we going, Daddy Chris?

30
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:45,185
We're headin' north.

31
00:03:45,393 --> 00:03:46,936
Why are we moving away?

32
00:03:47,145 --> 00:03:48,605
I like it here.

33
00:03:48,813 --> 00:03:51,191
To see if we can find your real daddy

34
00:03:51,399 --> 00:03:53,818
and if we can, well we
may able to scrape up

35
00:03:54,027 --> 00:03:56,154
enough money to send you away to school.

36
00:03:56,362 --> 00:03:58,448
But I don't wanna go to school.

37
00:03:58,656 --> 00:04:00,533
I wanna be a cowboy like you.

38
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:03,328
Aw, girls can't be cowboys.

39
00:04:03,536 --> 00:04:07,415
Can too, I can ride as well as you can.

40
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:09,626
But you still can't be a cowboy.

41
00:04:32,982 --> 00:04:34,082
What do you want?

42
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:35,639
I guess you know what we want.

43
00:04:35,818 --> 00:04:37,728
There's no use of beatin' around the bush.

44
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:39,697
We came here for Nina and we're willin'

45
00:04:39,906 --> 00:04:42,242
to offer you a fair proposition for her.

46
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,992
If that's all you came for, you might

47
00:04:43,993 --> 00:04:45,870
just as well leave right now.

48
00:04:46,079 --> 00:04:48,623
Now don't get hostile
Chris, you know as well

49
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,918
as we do that Sam Black
runs things in these parts.

50
00:04:52,126 --> 00:04:55,004
When he sends us out to get
the girl, we're gonna get her.

51
00:04:55,213 --> 00:04:56,941
Besides, he's been mighty good to you,

52
00:04:57,131 --> 00:04:59,008
offerin' to cut you in on that oil money.

53
00:05:00,343 --> 00:05:02,470
Well anyway, she isn't here.

54
00:05:02,679 --> 00:05:04,347
You can tell Sam Black for me that

55
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,100
she's left this part of
the country for good.

56
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,309
You can also tell him
that if he'd had the nerve

57
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,688
to come himself instead
of sending you renegades,

58
00:05:11,896 --> 00:05:14,440
that I'd have shoved that
offer right down his throat.

59
00:05:14,649 --> 00:05:18,361
Now come on, get outta here, all of ya.

60
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:23,283
We'll get out, maybe she ain't here

61
00:05:23,491 --> 00:05:25,285
but we're not givin' up that easy.

62
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:27,662
We're watchin' you and
we're watchin' the place,

63
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:30,007
so don't think you're
gettin' away with nothin'.

64
00:05:30,999 --> 00:05:33,084
Can I come out now Daddy Chris?

65
00:05:37,797 --> 00:05:39,173
Get her!

66
00:05:58,735 --> 00:06:00,903
Come on Daddy Chris, hit 'em!

67
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,853
Look out, it's me!

68
00:06:34,062 --> 00:06:35,162
What's that?

69
00:06:36,064 --> 00:06:37,357
He's gone.

70
00:06:38,608 --> 00:06:40,026
He got plum away from us.

71
00:06:40,234 --> 00:06:42,528
We better get Sam Black and go after him.

72
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:02,210
Goodbye little pardner.

73
00:09:02,418 --> 00:09:03,920
You want me to ride all alone?

74
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,088
Well it's the only way out for us.

75
00:09:06,297 --> 00:09:08,090
What about you Daddy Chris?

76
00:09:08,299 --> 00:09:10,510
Oh me, I'll be all right.

77
00:09:10,718 --> 00:09:12,400
Now you ride to the second bend below

78
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,555
and you'll hit Snake
Trail, you understand?

79
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,872
And when you get to Bud Moore's ranch

80
00:09:25,942 --> 00:09:27,079
tell him that I sent you.

81
00:09:27,276 --> 00:09:30,321
Tell him where I am and
that I'm needin' help.

82
00:10:13,114 --> 00:10:14,657
There's his tracks.

83
00:11:26,729 --> 00:11:28,731
Shorty, you stay with the horses.

84
00:11:28,939 --> 00:11:31,317
The rest of you scatter
around that thicket.

85
00:12:56,235 --> 00:12:59,447
Hey fellas, I got him, I got him!

86
00:12:59,655 --> 00:13:01,741
Come on boys, Sam's got him.

87
00:13:40,362 --> 00:13:41,822
Thought you said you got him.

88
00:13:42,031 --> 00:13:45,201
I had him all right,
but I guess he got away.

89
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,621
You guess he got away?

90
00:13:48,829 --> 00:13:50,239
He sent that kid on alone while

91
00:13:50,372 --> 00:13:52,166
he stayed here to cover the trail,

92
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,127
and that kid means $50,000 bucks to us.

93
00:14:59,775 --> 00:15:02,361
Get out and see if you
can round up them horses.

94
00:16:14,725 --> 00:16:16,727
Is this the Moore ranch?

95
00:16:16,936 --> 00:16:19,897
Used to be, but it's mine now.

96
00:16:20,105 --> 00:16:21,378
Well maybe you could tell me

97
00:16:21,398 --> 00:16:22,900
where I can find Bud Moore.

98
00:16:23,108 --> 00:16:24,652
He ain't here.

99
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,910
You ain't goin' nowhere.

100
00:16:34,536 --> 00:16:36,288
Let go of that youngster Vic.

101
00:16:36,497 --> 00:16:39,333
You been a hollerin' for
kitchen help, well here it is.

102
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:42,795
Well, what are you doin' here?

103
00:16:43,003 --> 00:16:45,089
Daddy sent me to find Bud Moore

104
00:16:45,297 --> 00:16:47,591
and he said he'd take care of me.

105
00:16:47,800 --> 00:16:49,255
We'll take care of ya all right.

106
00:16:49,385 --> 00:16:50,485
Go on, get in the house.

107
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,304
Now you let her alone, if she's gonna

108
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:54,139
help me, I'll take care of her.

109
00:16:54,348 --> 00:16:55,849
All right.

110
00:17:04,191 --> 00:17:06,193
You ain't scared o' me are ya?

111
00:17:12,282 --> 00:17:14,118
Aw you needn't worry none about

112
00:17:14,326 --> 00:17:16,078
him as long as I'm here.

113
00:17:16,286 --> 00:17:18,664
Come on, let's go in the house huh?

114
00:17:35,806 --> 00:17:39,435
Now now, there ain't
nobody here but you and me.

115
00:17:42,062 --> 00:17:43,439
Up you go there.

116
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:47,776
Now then, what's your name honey?

117
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:49,486
Nina Morrell.

118
00:17:50,696 --> 00:17:52,448
Is your pop's name Chris?

119
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:54,366
Yes, you know him?

120
00:17:54,575 --> 00:17:55,993
Yeah, I used to.

121
00:17:57,161 --> 00:17:58,871
How come he ain't with ya?

122
00:17:59,079 --> 00:18:01,790
Sam Black and his gang were after us and

123
00:18:02,791 --> 00:18:05,794
we only had one horse, so Daddy Chris

124
00:18:06,003 --> 00:18:08,964
told me to get on and ride him and--

125
00:18:10,174 --> 00:18:11,383
Okay.

126
00:18:33,405 --> 00:18:34,947
Oh Mr. Norton would you order that

127
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:35,824
bowl of calico for me?

128
00:18:36,033 --> 00:18:37,159
I will Miss Clara.

129
00:18:37,367 --> 00:18:38,826
You haven't seen my brother Jim--

130
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:39,703
No, I haven't.

131
00:18:39,912 --> 00:18:41,079
I thought if he were in town,

132
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,671
he might want to ride back with me.

133
00:18:42,831 --> 00:18:43,931
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

134
00:19:13,612 --> 00:19:15,322
Help!

135
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:19,910
I'll meet you at the old ranch.

136
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:21,620
Help, help!

137
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:25,916
Help, help, help!

138
00:19:51,191 --> 00:19:53,485
I've been robbed, a fellow
with a checkered shirt,

139
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:56,655
black hat, and he had a black
handkerchief across his face.

140
00:20:00,784 --> 00:20:02,828
No, I tell ya I can't be mistaken.

141
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:06,206
He had on a checkered
shirt and a black hat.

142
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,167
Why, he took $6000 from me

143
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,002
and stuffed it into a gunny sack.

144
00:20:10,210 --> 00:20:11,586
- Which way did he go?
- Well I don't know

145
00:20:11,587 --> 00:20:12,687
which way he went.

146
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,814
So you can see for
yourself there's nothing

147
00:23:18,815 --> 00:23:21,443
else for me to do but turn
you over to the sheriff.

148
00:23:21,651 --> 00:23:24,363
Seriously ma'am,
you've got the wrong man.

149
00:23:24,571 --> 00:23:26,030
Well why are you wearing the checkered

150
00:23:26,031 --> 00:23:27,324
shirt and the black hat?

151
00:23:27,532 --> 00:23:29,451
Not to mention the gunny sack.

152
00:23:29,659 --> 00:23:31,536
If I knew who these belonged to,

153
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:33,830
I'd know who robbed the express office.

154
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:35,874
You mean they don't belong to you?

155
00:23:36,083 --> 00:23:37,709
That's what I mean.

156
00:23:37,918 --> 00:23:39,378
You expect me to believe that?

157
00:23:39,586 --> 00:23:41,797
Well I hope you will.

158
00:23:42,005 --> 00:23:44,299
And if I did, what would you do?

159
00:23:44,508 --> 00:23:47,969
Well, first I'd see that
my little pardner was safe,

160
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:51,723
then I'd find the man that
belongs to this shirt.

161
00:23:51,932 --> 00:23:53,308
You wouldn't run away?

162
00:23:53,517 --> 00:23:54,893
Do you think I would?

163
00:23:55,102 --> 00:23:56,853
No, I don't think so.

164
00:23:58,063 --> 00:23:59,730
Where'd you send your little partner?

165
00:23:59,731 --> 00:24:02,359
To Bud Moore's ranch down River Valley.

166
00:24:02,567 --> 00:24:03,667
Bud Moore?

167
00:24:03,693 --> 00:24:05,193
Yes, I used to ride herd with him

168
00:24:05,278 --> 00:24:06,780
in the panhandle, you know him?

169
00:24:06,988 --> 00:24:09,032
Why yes, he's my brother.

170
00:24:09,241 --> 00:24:11,701
That is, he was my brother.

171
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:13,954
I don't quite get you.

172
00:24:14,162 --> 00:24:16,832
- Bud's dead.
- Oh.

173
00:24:18,750 --> 00:24:21,211
He was killed in a range war last year.

174
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:22,546
Oh I'm sorry.

175
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:25,340
It was a bit of a shock at first, but

176
00:24:25,549 --> 00:24:27,717
I guess you can get used to anything.

177
00:24:27,926 --> 00:24:31,054
Well, did Bud ever mention my name?

178
00:24:31,263 --> 00:24:32,597
Chris Morrell?

179
00:24:32,806 --> 00:24:34,349
Are you Chris Morrell?

180
00:24:34,558 --> 00:24:35,933
Why he used to say you were the

181
00:24:35,934 --> 00:24:37,811
best friend a man ever had.

182
00:24:38,019 --> 00:24:40,272
I guess that's puttin'
it pretty strong, ma'am.

183
00:24:41,523 --> 00:24:42,623
Clara.

184
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,901
Come on let's go up to my
place and change that shirt.

185
00:24:45,902 --> 00:24:47,695
There'll be a lot of
people looking for it.

186
00:24:47,696 --> 00:24:50,240
Yes, ma'am, I mean Clara.

187
00:24:56,371 --> 00:24:59,249
Nina's mother was a full blood old sage.

188
00:24:59,458 --> 00:25:01,277
She married a good for nothing white man

189
00:25:01,418 --> 00:25:04,379
who left her two months
before the kid was born.

190
00:25:05,422 --> 00:25:06,923
Her mother died.

191
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,171
Hello Clara.

192
00:25:46,379 --> 00:25:48,089
Chris, this is my brother Jim.

193
00:25:50,217 --> 00:25:52,036
I'll make you some coffee before you go.

194
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:54,387
Well thanks ma'am, I mean Clara.

195
00:26:07,317 --> 00:26:08,652
So you're Jim.

196
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,112
What about it?

197
00:26:11,321 --> 00:26:13,490
Nothing, only I came to for a minute

198
00:26:13,698 --> 00:26:16,117
when you changed shirts
with me at the creek.

199
00:26:18,119 --> 00:26:20,330
Well why don't ya tell her?

200
00:26:20,539 --> 00:26:22,791
In the first place,
because it'd break her heart.

201
00:26:24,084 --> 00:26:26,039
In the second place,
because snakes like you

202
00:26:26,044 --> 00:26:28,046
usually die of their own poison.

203
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:34,177
What was that noise?

204
00:26:34,386 --> 00:26:35,929
Why, Jim was showin' me his gun

205
00:26:36,137 --> 00:26:38,014
and it dropped out of his hand.

206
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,560
Have some coffee Jim?

207
00:26:41,768 --> 00:26:44,020
Not now, later.

208
00:26:48,108 --> 00:26:50,193
I'm glad to have met you.

209
00:26:50,402 --> 00:26:52,112
Same to you.

210
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:09,421
How do you like Jim?

211
00:27:09,629 --> 00:27:11,965
Well some men are like books

212
00:27:12,173 --> 00:27:14,593
written in a strange language, and that

213
00:27:14,801 --> 00:27:16,761
makes it awfully hard to read them.

214
00:27:17,804 --> 00:27:19,680
I hope I wasn't wrong
in reading you, Chris.

215
00:27:19,681 --> 00:27:21,433
Oh no, ma'am.

216
00:27:21,641 --> 00:27:24,144
You were telling me about
Nina just before Jim came in.

217
00:27:27,022 --> 00:27:28,440
Well Nina--

218
00:27:28,648 --> 00:27:30,400
That guy recognized you, he knows you

219
00:27:30,609 --> 00:27:32,337
pulled that job at the express office.

220
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:33,778
I told you not to stop.

221
00:27:33,987 --> 00:27:35,321
Well I thought it'd be a good way to

222
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,114
hang it on him and leave us in the clear.

223
00:27:37,115 --> 00:27:38,215
Where's the money?

224
00:27:38,325 --> 00:27:39,425
The old hollow stump.

225
00:27:39,618 --> 00:27:40,869
Let's go get it.

226
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,204
In order to protect her interests, we

227
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,915
started out to find Nina's father.

228
00:27:46,124 --> 00:27:47,751
Sam Black and his gang figured that

229
00:27:47,959 --> 00:27:49,878
she was worth a lot of money.

230
00:27:50,086 --> 00:27:53,006
Luckily, I got the best
of them and stampeded

231
00:27:53,214 --> 00:27:55,258
their horses and made a getaway.

232
00:27:56,593 --> 00:27:58,595
Well I guess I'd better be going.

233
00:28:03,183 --> 00:28:05,644
Oh no, you'd better
take this one, it's Jim's.

234
00:28:08,772 --> 00:28:10,106
Thank you.

235
00:28:10,315 --> 00:28:11,690
You'll bring Nina back won't you?

236
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:13,443
I sure will, Clara.

237
00:28:17,781 --> 00:28:19,240
Thanks a lot.

238
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:32,545
Goodbye Chris.

239
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:36,883
- Here pig, pig, pig
- Oink, oink, oink.

240
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:40,887
Pig, pig, pig, pig.

241
00:28:51,439 --> 00:28:53,692
Hey kid, come here.

242
00:29:04,327 --> 00:29:05,704
What's your name?

243
00:29:05,912 --> 00:29:07,012
Nina Morrell.

244
00:29:07,122 --> 00:29:09,374
- Nina Morrell?
- Yes, sir.

245
00:29:09,582 --> 00:29:12,001
Daddy Chris is my daddy.

246
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:13,503
How come?

247
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,047
She rode in lookin' for Bud Moore.

248
00:29:16,256 --> 00:29:17,799
Vic made her stay.

249
00:29:22,721 --> 00:29:25,223
I didn't know Chris was a squaw man.

250
00:29:25,432 --> 00:29:26,599
He ain't, neither.

251
00:29:26,808 --> 00:29:27,908
What do you mean?

252
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:30,353
She ain't his kid, she's your kid.

253
00:29:31,855 --> 00:29:33,523
How do you know?

254
00:29:33,732 --> 00:29:36,192
Chris and me was there when she was born

255
00:29:36,401 --> 00:29:39,112
and for two days after
when your wife died.

256
00:29:41,072 --> 00:29:44,451
Come here kid, I want to talk to ya.

257
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:12,129
I'll bet that's the
bunch that belongs to

258
00:30:12,145 --> 00:30:13,980
Sam Black and his gang.

259
00:30:30,079 --> 00:30:31,663
Gosh, I wish I had somethin' to put

260
00:30:31,664 --> 00:30:33,666
on my dogs, they're sure sore.

261
00:30:33,875 --> 00:30:35,250
Well it was your fault for lettin'

262
00:30:35,251 --> 00:30:38,087
Morrell stampede the
horses, now go find him.

263
00:30:38,296 --> 00:30:39,798
Well where'll I go?

264
00:30:40,006 --> 00:30:42,216
I don't know of any place
around here to get horses.

265
00:30:42,217 --> 00:30:44,594
I don't care where you get 'em, get 'em.

266
00:31:42,110 --> 00:31:44,946
Hey you fellas, wait a minute!

267
00:31:53,288 --> 00:31:54,956
Wait a minute there.

268
00:31:57,667 --> 00:31:59,627
- Them's our horses.
- Who's ours?

269
00:31:59,836 --> 00:32:01,004
Sam Black and the boys.

270
00:32:01,212 --> 00:32:02,312
Sam Black?

271
00:32:02,380 --> 00:32:03,756
That's the man I wanna see.

272
00:32:03,965 --> 00:32:06,175
Well come on, we're
camped right over yonder.

273
00:32:27,155 --> 00:32:28,656
Got our horses back.

274
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:31,784
- Sam Black?
- That's me.

275
00:32:35,079 --> 00:32:37,665
You lookin' for a half-breed
kid named Nina Morrell?

276
00:32:37,874 --> 00:32:39,667
- You said it.
- I got her.

277
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:41,127
What's the idea?

278
00:32:41,336 --> 00:32:43,171
I'll exchange if you count me in.

279
00:32:43,379 --> 00:32:44,479
For how much?

280
00:32:44,505 --> 00:32:45,840
10,000 and--

281
00:32:46,049 --> 00:32:47,675
What's the and for?

282
00:32:47,884 --> 00:32:49,635
Chris Morrell's scalp, do you know him?

283
00:32:49,636 --> 00:32:51,596
Yeah, where do I find him?

284
00:32:51,804 --> 00:32:54,474
Clara Moore's homestead,
I'll show ya how to get there.

285
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:55,808
You're on.

286
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:58,144
Good, you cut me in for 10,000

287
00:32:58,353 --> 00:33:00,605
and bring the scalp of
Chris Morrell to my ranch

288
00:33:00,813 --> 00:33:02,398
and I'll turn the kid over to ya.

289
00:33:02,607 --> 00:33:03,707
Where's your place?

290
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:05,446
Here, I'll show ya how to get from

291
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:07,195
the Moore homestead to my ranch.

292
00:33:16,496 --> 00:33:19,040
Why Matt Downing, you old buzzard.

293
00:33:19,248 --> 00:33:21,042
Chris Morrell.

294
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,887
I know from the what the kid
said you couldn't be far away.

295
00:33:24,087 --> 00:33:25,187
Well is she all right?

296
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,396
Where is she?

297
00:33:26,464 --> 00:33:29,050
At the Byrd ranch,
used to be Bud Moore's.

298
00:33:29,258 --> 00:33:32,095
- Dad's there too.
- Her dad?

299
00:33:32,303 --> 00:33:35,848
Yeah, come on, I'll tell
you all about it on the way.

300
00:33:49,654 --> 00:33:50,780
It's a cinch.

301
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:53,950
All right, I'll be seein'
ya, come on fellas.

302
00:34:11,467 --> 00:34:13,511
50/50 on that money for the kid.

303
00:34:13,720 --> 00:34:16,347
Sure, but we'll go

304
00:34:16,556 --> 00:34:18,433
split that express money first.

305
00:36:04,664 --> 00:36:05,790
Look!

306
00:36:41,909 --> 00:36:43,286
Vic got me.

307
00:36:43,494 --> 00:36:45,163
Vic Byrd?

308
00:36:45,371 --> 00:36:48,875
He made me rob the express office

309
00:36:49,083 --> 00:36:51,085
and he got the money.

310
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:53,045
You know where he went?

311
00:36:53,254 --> 00:36:56,090
Yeah, to the ranch

312
00:36:57,258 --> 00:36:59,177
to get your kid.

313
00:36:59,385 --> 00:37:01,888
To give her to Sam Black.

314
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:07,602
Please don't tell my sister about me.

315
00:37:07,810 --> 00:37:09,437
Get him into a doctor, quick,

316
00:37:09,645 --> 00:37:11,606
and bring the sheriff back with you.

317
00:37:21,199 --> 00:37:22,491
Where's Chris Morrell?

318
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:23,910
- He's gone.
- Where?

319
00:37:24,118 --> 00:37:25,661
I don't know.

320
00:37:25,870 --> 00:37:28,039
Take a look inside, she might be lyin'.

321
00:37:39,383 --> 00:37:41,510
- There's nobody inside.
- All right.

322
00:37:41,719 --> 00:37:45,014
You're ridin' with us, maybe
you can remember where he went.

323
00:38:09,163 --> 00:38:10,891
Look out now, look out, hold on tight,

324
00:38:10,915 --> 00:38:12,015
I'm gonna buck ya!

325
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:16,128
Hold on now, oh he's a regular
old sun fish this horse is.

326
00:38:24,220 --> 00:38:25,721
What's the idea?

327
00:38:30,351 --> 00:38:33,271
Well you see, she's my kid, Vic.

328
00:38:33,479 --> 00:38:35,690
I just found it out, my kid.

329
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:38,818
Yeah, well she's worth
10,000 bucks to me.

330
00:38:40,611 --> 00:38:41,904
What do you mean?

331
00:38:42,113 --> 00:38:44,991
I told Sam Black I'd
turn her over for 10,000.

332
00:38:53,457 --> 00:38:57,503
Well you're out of luck, she's
worth more than that to me.

333
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:03,509
You better change your mind, Tom.

334
00:39:05,469 --> 00:39:06,887
You heard me.

335
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:30,161
You keep your hands off my kid.

336
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:32,204
I ain't takin' orders from you.

337
00:39:36,292 --> 00:39:39,211
Daddy, Daddy Chris!

338
00:40:10,785 --> 00:40:12,536
Sam Black and his gang.

339
00:40:12,745 --> 00:40:14,121
Look out, Chris!

340
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,473
They won't get my kid.

341
00:40:32,681 --> 00:40:33,909
Who told you she was yours?

342
00:40:34,058 --> 00:40:35,768
Matt told me, and Vic told me about

343
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:38,020
Sam Black and his gang wantin' her.

344
00:42:36,388 --> 00:42:39,850
I got an idea without us
takin' any more chances.

345
00:42:42,019 --> 00:42:43,479
Empty.

346
00:42:51,612 --> 00:42:53,113
Hey fellas!

347
00:42:54,532 --> 00:42:55,783
One left.

348
00:43:01,539 --> 00:43:02,957
Fellas!

349
00:43:03,165 --> 00:43:04,458
Hey you!

350
00:43:05,793 --> 00:43:07,419
Hey you fellas!

351
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:13,133
Hey there, trade you
the woman for the kid.

352
00:43:15,511 --> 00:43:16,887
How about it?

353
00:43:28,315 --> 00:43:31,527
Hey fellas, what's the
matter with ya, ya deaf?

354
00:43:31,735 --> 00:43:34,822
Trade you the woman for
the kid, did you get it?

355
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:38,158
No, not in a million years!

356
00:43:58,929 --> 00:44:00,973
Don't worry little pardner, I wouldn't

357
00:44:01,181 --> 00:44:03,017
give you up for anything.

358
00:44:18,157 --> 00:44:21,410
Hey Sam Black, are you listenin'?

359
00:44:21,619 --> 00:44:23,078
Yeah, say it.

360
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,459
How'd you like to
trade me for the woman?

361
00:44:34,214 --> 00:44:35,424
Sure.

362
00:44:37,092 --> 00:44:39,803
You're on, come out with
your hands in the air

363
00:44:40,012 --> 00:44:42,306
and we'll send the woman at the same time.

364
00:44:44,433 --> 00:44:48,312
Only one cartridge left,
and I've got an idea.

365
00:45:01,742 --> 00:45:03,160
Come on.

366
00:45:07,956 --> 00:45:09,291
Come on.

367
00:45:26,684 --> 00:45:29,186
Be sure and use that last bullet right.

368
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:32,773
Goodbye, cowboy.

369
00:46:43,010 --> 00:46:46,346
Keep going Clara, no matter what happens.

370
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:23,717
Now rush 'em.

371
00:47:42,736 --> 00:47:43,987
Help!

372
00:47:47,616 --> 00:47:49,159
Help!

373
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,798
That kid's comin' with me.

374
00:48:03,006 --> 00:48:04,550
Oh no she's not.

375
00:48:46,967 --> 00:48:47,759
Where's Nina?

376
00:48:47,968 --> 00:48:49,068
Black took her.

377
00:52:07,417 --> 00:52:09,753
Naughty, naughty!
