1
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:44,097
Edinburgh, the royal town
and the capital of Scotland.

2
00:01:44,547 --> 00:01:48,665
The ancient castles are
the guards of the historic city.

3
00:01:52,707 --> 00:01:57,106
Once a year, travelers
from all over the world are coming...

4
00:01:57,107 --> 00:02:00,226
to watch the beginning
of the Edinburgh Festival...

5
00:02:00,227 --> 00:02:03,663
which is dedicated to high-
more particularly art.

6
00:02:05,427 --> 00:02:08,305
Occasionally, there is space
and for something like that.

7
00:02:29,467 --> 00:02:32,866
At the wedding of Macquette
up there in Cleveland...

8
00:02:32,867 --> 00:02:36,306
the guests have been invited
to the health of the...

9
00:02:36,307 --> 00:02:39,458
when mild whiskey is mild
and me...

10
00:02:39,907 --> 00:02:43,024
Macquitos was pleased to die.

11
00:02:43,467 --> 00:02:46,265
The musicians played cheerfully...

12
00:02:46,507 --> 00:02:49,738
his uncle did not
start dancing...

13
00:02:50,267 --> 00:02:54,624
but the area was solved
and his skirt fell.

14
00:02:57,347 --> 00:02:59,736
When Macquitus tried leave...

15
00:03:01,307 --> 00:03:04,219
it was blocked by friends...

16
00:03:04,547 --> 00:03:07,425
you have to dance...

17
00:03:07,987 --> 00:03:11,024
because the door was locked.

18
00:03:11,227 --> 00:03:14,264
Macquitos was angry
he did not know what to do...

19
00:03:14,467 --> 00:03:17,345
tried to stop the wedding...

20
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:21,176
turned the watch back,
tore the date...

21
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:59,586
- Charlie!
- Mrs. Frost?

22
00:04:59,587 --> 00:05:01,866
A handheld or a dummy?

23
00:05:01,867 --> 00:05:04,256
- We're both deaf!
- I hope you're right.

24
00:06:08,307 --> 00:06:10,026
- Get out and tell them something.
- What do I say?

25
00:06:10,027 --> 00:06:12,063
It does not seem to me!

26
00:06:15,147 --> 00:06:18,105
Ladies and gentlemen
if you allow me...

27
00:06:24,267 --> 00:06:27,304
We want Frost!

28
00:06:32,987 --> 00:06:37,503
Thanks for honoring me, I
do not know what to say.

29
00:06:37,747 --> 00:06:39,783
We want our money.

30
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:43,061
I know I have not paid
some accounts...

31
00:06:43,347 --> 00:06:46,544
Two of my own have begun
to load the tents.

32
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,857
If I do not pay, I'll get it.

33
00:06:49,067 --> 00:06:52,106
If I get it I will not be able to
to make a premiere...

34
00:06:52,107 --> 00:06:56,180
and no one will be paid.
You have to leave me open!

35
00:06:56,627 --> 00:06:59,425
It's not about money,
it's a matter of order.

36
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,576
Do not you want the money?

37
00:07:05,427 --> 00:07:10,296
- The tax office will get it!
- You are magnanimous.

38
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:16,226
Look at these chums
girls! Open the curtain!

39
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:22,343
They work hard all of
them, they are all stars!

40
00:07:23,067 --> 00:07:26,582
Think about their
career, please...

41
00:07:26,787 --> 00:07:29,824
I came from America
to bring you their talent.

42
00:07:30,027 --> 00:07:33,099
People are coming from all over the world
the world in your city.

43
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:39,746
- Awesome performance!
- She has another...

44
00:07:40,307 --> 00:07:43,185
Please let me know
a little more.

45
00:07:43,387 --> 00:07:46,299
- How long do you want?
- Give me three days.

46
00:07:50,747 --> 00:07:55,980
- We'll give you 48 hours.
- I love you all, thank you.

47
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:02,664
You are wonderful, thank you.

48
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:08,660
Kids, rehearse tomorrow
in the morning at ten o'clock.

49
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:11,620
You did not dance
well, leave now.

50
00:08:12,307 --> 00:08:14,901
We did not dance well
because we do not eat.

51
00:08:15,107 --> 00:08:17,337
The artists
he is not thinking about food.

52
00:08:18,227 --> 00:08:22,015
I do not want to say it to Mr. Frost
but we have to pay...

53
00:08:24,507 --> 00:08:28,819
- You have no faith?
- I have faith, I have no hope!

54
00:08:30,027 --> 00:08:32,336
- Can I talk to you?
- Tomorrow my dear.

55
00:08:34,427 --> 00:08:37,021
You went to stop them,
get the shit out!

56
00:08:38,107 --> 00:08:40,905
- Did you load them?
- Do not you see?

57
00:08:41,107 --> 00:08:44,463
The naive tells you
go back inside.

58
00:08:45,507 --> 00:08:48,066
- We're done!
- Please, Philis!

59
00:08:48,067 --> 00:08:50,979
There was no money either
organization, it's all a mess!

60
00:08:51,227 --> 00:08:53,626
- Calm down my love.
- Find another star!

61
00:08:53,627 --> 00:08:57,415
- The Philadelphia pavement!
- I do not quite do that!

62
00:09:02,787 --> 00:09:06,146
- What is it, Mr. Frost?
- Now we do not have a star!

63
00:09:06,147 --> 00:09:08,906
- We do not have a star!
- Are you a parrot?

64
00:09:08,907 --> 00:09:11,866
I will make a premiere and I will not have
neither star nor money!

65
00:09:11,867 --> 00:09:15,223
- We need a miracle!
- And we'll find it!

66
00:09:49,187 --> 00:09:53,578
- Good morning, ladies.
- Hello Mrs. Erikis.

67
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:58,905
- Want your feet?
- We did not want to hear anything.

68
00:09:59,107 --> 00:10:04,022
Your kindness, but you do not
pay for 2 weeks.

69
00:10:04,267 --> 00:10:07,145
- We'll pay you.
- You have no faith?

70
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:10,266
You were on the show
before you come...

71
00:10:10,267 --> 00:10:14,897
I have done them myself, do not
interfere with our relationship.

72
00:10:15,467 --> 00:10:19,062
I have two tickets
for the premiere.

73
00:10:19,267 --> 00:10:22,266
You have already given me half
first row, thank you.

74
00:10:22,267 --> 00:10:26,826
We invoke your dedication
in Edinburgh...

75
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:30,626
people from all over the world are
coming to your wonderful city.

76
00:10:30,627 --> 00:10:34,984
- You will come to us!
- Okay, you won!

77
00:10:36,147 --> 00:10:39,746
I forgot to tell you that
you have a visitor back.

78
00:10:39,747 --> 00:10:43,535
- Who is he?
- From the motif, he wants money.

79
00:10:48,667 --> 00:10:53,263
My dude was coming in here
when it was late in the evenings.

80
00:10:53,547 --> 00:10:56,666
I have to say it is
very lucky man.

81
00:10:56,667 --> 00:11:01,058
Yes, he has been dying for ten
years ago, you're coming now!

82
00:11:04,267 --> 00:11:09,182
Do not wait any longer, can
do not bring the girls.

83
00:11:10,067 --> 00:11:14,186
I have instructions to wait until
I'll get 10 pounds.

84
00:11:14,187 --> 00:11:18,260
- I'll wait.
- Good night!

85
00:11:30,387 --> 00:11:32,981
I'm late, I'm late!

86
00:11:37,227 --> 00:11:39,422
Come on, get up!

87
00:11:40,827 --> 00:11:43,295
Look at what time it is!

88
00:12:03,627 --> 00:12:06,266
Run, I know you're in.

89
00:12:06,267 --> 00:12:08,827
We will leave the exit cheating!

90
00:12:09,227 --> 00:12:10,455
Run!

91
00:12:13,987 --> 00:12:17,457
Give me and the cattle,
you have to hurry too!

92
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:21,217
Release the door immediately!

93
00:12:22,627 --> 00:12:25,903
- Good morning, why do you get it?
- How can I not shine?

94
00:12:26,147 --> 00:12:28,466
I want my money where it is
Miss Jowve?

95
00:12:28,467 --> 00:12:30,866
She left for the theater,
did not you see her?

96
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:34,746
- Here it is, I know it!
- Look under the bed.

97
00:12:35,227 --> 00:12:38,106
I told you not to go
to work without money.

98
00:12:38,107 --> 00:12:43,704
I told you he left, we have
rehearse and I'm late!

99
00:12:55,867 --> 00:12:58,939
- Did you make a sound?
- Yes, I hope you do not mind.

100
00:12:59,147 --> 00:13:01,615
- I'm late.
- Come in.

101
00:13:03,267 --> 00:13:05,542
- You're not American?
- Yeah, how did you get it?

102
00:13:05,747 --> 00:13:08,466
You have so much at home!

103
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:16,865
- Your kindness, sir...
- My name is Bates.

104
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:20,139
- I'm Jave Tweed.
- Are you working in Mercury?

105
00:13:20,347 --> 00:13:24,022
- Not if we do not reach 15.
- We'll get to ten!

106
00:13:33,067 --> 00:13:35,137
Is it necessary?

107
00:13:39,307 --> 00:13:42,902
I will not arrive in time,
is there anything wrong?

108
00:13:43,347 --> 00:13:46,066
I will overtake if and not need to.

109
00:13:55,747 --> 00:13:58,136
The police are following us!

110
00:13:59,467 --> 00:14:01,935
I was wrong for ten minutes.

111
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:13,506
Will we rehearse without Phyllis?

112
00:14:13,507 --> 00:14:17,466
We will make a premiere with or without
star! I started the rehearsal.

113
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:24,457
Hello thank you.

114
00:14:26,147 --> 00:14:27,944
Good morning, Mac.

115
00:14:58,347 --> 00:15:02,101
It was not good, who told you
do you look up there?

116
00:15:02,267 --> 00:15:05,179
- You said it!
- Me? Never!

117
00:15:05,347 --> 00:15:07,417
That's the cheap places...

118
00:15:07,627 --> 00:15:09,822
you will look forward
to the exact somehow so...

119
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:12,746
for them you play, from here
the money is coming.

120
00:15:12,947 --> 00:15:14,665
Let's go again, we start.

121
00:15:36,747 --> 00:15:39,386
- At last, where are you?
- Do not tell me, Charlie.

122
00:15:39,387 --> 00:15:43,066
- I'm the reserver...
- Yes, the best one!

123
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:47,666
And be careful not to have it
problems Mr Frost, I know.

124
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,386
You do a great job
sav tv mavajer!

125
00:16:21,427 --> 00:16:25,026
Mr Frost, I said
how we ended this way.

126
00:16:25,027 --> 00:16:27,906
- That was yesterday.
- He did not know you changed it.

127
00:16:27,907 --> 00:16:31,746
Yes, of course, stop!
You just came, I saw you.

128
00:16:31,747 --> 00:16:34,506
- I had an accident.
- Yes sure...

129
00:16:34,507 --> 00:16:36,986
You ended up doing so,
rather than being good.

130
00:16:36,987 --> 00:16:40,546
- I am sorry.
- I'm sorry about you...

131
00:16:40,547 --> 00:16:44,386
and for all of you, a life
you will be moderate dancers.

132
00:16:44,387 --> 00:16:47,586
How do you remind me I arrived?
Where am I today?

133
00:16:47,587 --> 00:16:53,344
I had courage, determination
and no one ever.

134
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:57,386
Did not hit our ribbon!

135
00:16:57,387 --> 00:16:59,746
The stars are not made
with cubicles.

136
00:16:59,747 --> 00:17:02,546
I have talent for that
you will always live in ballet.

137
00:17:02,547 --> 00:17:05,584
You make mistaken Mr.
Frost, I give up!

138
00:17:08,867 --> 00:17:10,664
One minute!

139
00:17:10,867 --> 00:17:13,097
No one resigns here,
you are fired!

140
00:17:13,387 --> 00:17:18,256
- It's my pleasure!
- You have a break for kids.

141
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:26,856
- The Joweye, please.
- You have to wait.

142
00:17:28,427 --> 00:17:31,260
- The Jvette Joe, please.
- You wait, rehearsal.

143
00:17:31,747 --> 00:17:34,819
You will see it after me.

144
00:17:35,147 --> 00:17:38,298
I want to give her the
tea, leave her in the car.

145
00:17:38,507 --> 00:17:40,862
You can not see it until
the rehearsal is over.

146
00:17:41,067 --> 00:17:43,706
- Did you get me, Mac?
- No, my dear.

147
00:17:45,387 --> 00:17:48,826
- Are you Mr. Tramov's chauffeur?
- No, Mr Bruno.

148
00:17:48,827 --> 00:17:51,666
The manufacturer
of worship cards?

149
00:17:51,667 --> 00:17:54,426
- Exactly.
- Did he send you for me?

150
00:17:54,427 --> 00:17:56,706
- I'm saying Betty Samers.
- I'm afraid not.

151
00:17:56,707 --> 00:17:59,858
I'm waiting for Miss Jowow,
are you her boyfriend?

152
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:04,145
You will do me your favor
give her her cake?

153
00:18:04,787 --> 00:18:08,575
Gladly, give her the love
Tell me, Mr. Bruno.

154
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,426
I do not think he will appreciate it.

155
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:24,977
I will not wait any longer, do not say
to Joe that I was not here.

156
00:18:27,667 --> 00:18:30,706
- I did not see you!
- If you danced with the energy...

157
00:18:30,707 --> 00:18:34,859
you run into the corridors,
we may have had good show.

158
00:18:36,787 --> 00:18:38,826
- What do you got there?
- A cake.

159
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,978
It's Joe's, it's
friendship of Bruno.

160
00:18:42,147 --> 00:18:44,342
And is this reason you...

161
00:18:44,587 --> 00:18:47,021
- Filthy?
- By Bij Giovanni.

162
00:18:47,227 --> 00:18:49,866
It's one of the richest-
Scotland's finest apostles.

163
00:18:49,867 --> 00:18:53,257
- You're a millionaire.
- I know, I was looking for it.

164
00:18:54,147 --> 00:18:57,298
It comes out from our girls...

165
00:18:57,947 --> 00:19:01,496
- How do you tell me?
- Betty Samers.

166
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:04,779
- I wanted to talk to you about...
- Not now...

167
00:19:05,667 --> 00:19:09,546
- I'll give her the tea.
- Give me a little time...

168
00:19:09,747 --> 00:19:13,456
I will give you an increase in
the time I pay.

169
00:19:14,827 --> 00:19:18,297
- Yes, Mr. Frost?
- Do not do that!

170
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:23,498
Who is he that says he will
less for ballet?

171
00:19:24,147 --> 00:19:27,503
You will not leave the city
unless you make money first.

172
00:19:27,707 --> 00:19:30,983
You will go to Frost and you will
the transformed daughter.

173
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:34,782
Excluded, then
from so many insults.

174
00:19:34,987 --> 00:19:38,024
- And why else?
- There are many reasons.

175
00:19:38,227 --> 00:19:41,856
You are the one who is
we owe you, do you want to live?

176
00:19:44,747 --> 00:19:49,025
You are so stupid; Javet
he goes with the Bruve.

177
00:19:49,467 --> 00:19:52,584
Is she a trustee, does
she say anything to you?

178
00:19:52,787 --> 00:19:55,347
Bij Giovanni, the millionaire?

179
00:19:55,587 --> 00:19:59,546
Multimillionaire!
It is worth 5 maybe 6 million.

180
00:20:00,587 --> 00:20:05,581
Jowve with a millionaire,
what a pity.

181
00:20:06,427 --> 00:20:09,260
Why; She's a good
girl, the best.

182
00:20:09,467 --> 00:20:13,096
- He was flying fast.
- He's not working here.

183
00:20:13,307 --> 00:20:16,265
Do not be clear, we saved!
If he loves Bruno...

184
00:20:17,627 --> 00:20:21,336
- What do you have?
- You do not remember her?

185
00:20:22,347 --> 00:20:26,135
That's it! It will
we're staring, that's gonna happen...

186
00:20:26,307 --> 00:20:28,026
- Where does it stay?
- I do not know.

187
00:20:28,027 --> 00:20:32,259
Why do not you know?
Do I ask something so hard?

188
00:20:37,827 --> 00:20:40,586
- Where's the Savvette Jowve?
- What, sir?

189
00:20:40,587 --> 00:20:44,421
Everyone is afraid of me!
Where do you put the names from J?

190
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,776
Find here to find
its management.

191
00:20:48,027 --> 00:20:50,143
Do not sit, do something!

192
00:20:53,427 --> 00:20:55,786
Why is it nothing in his place;

193
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,986
A direction I want
in the name of Jow.

194
00:20:58,987 --> 00:21:02,457
You can not do it nothing right?

195
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:07,866
The problem is that
there is no system here.

196
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:10,746
I have to show you
and archiving?

197
00:21:10,747 --> 00:21:14,342
- Fr.
- Later, I have a job.

198
00:21:15,027 --> 00:21:17,426
Because we have no leadership
girls?

199
00:21:17,427 --> 00:21:19,506
What would you do if you were ill
some of them?

200
00:21:19,507 --> 00:21:21,586
I would call the doctor.

201
00:21:21,587 --> 00:21:24,340
- I wanted to ask...
- look for you too!

202
00:21:26,387 --> 00:21:29,546
Who are you; - Javet Joeves.

203
00:21:29,547 --> 00:21:32,266
Do not sit, look to address!

204
00:21:32,907 --> 00:21:36,343
- The Directorate?
- Javet Joe's!

205
00:21:41,547 --> 00:21:45,586
- What did you say you were?
- Javet Joeves.

206
00:21:46,387 --> 00:21:49,504
Jacqueline Joe, Charlie!

207
00:21:50,067 --> 00:21:52,945
All I have to do is do it!

208
00:21:53,267 --> 00:21:56,543
Where were you, we searched for
to find you! Come in...

209
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:00,547
Conspiracy about clutter
but we wanted to find you...

210
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:05,176
I came to ask for a word
for my behavior.

211
00:22:05,427 --> 00:22:08,658
- I lost my temper.
- I understand you...

212
00:22:08,867 --> 00:22:11,506
I like girls who have courage.

213
00:22:11,707 --> 00:22:14,540
- Here's your cake.
- Where did you find her?

214
00:22:14,747 --> 00:22:17,944
That's what we have to say
for your position on the show.

215
00:22:18,267 --> 00:22:22,021
- Get me a contract.
- I dance well you know...

216
00:22:22,227 --> 00:22:24,866
I do not think you've seen me
to dance solo.

217
00:22:25,067 --> 00:22:27,422
It is not necessary
to see you love me...

218
00:22:27,787 --> 00:22:30,506
now you can not find it
nor a contract?

219
00:22:30,707 --> 00:22:33,267
Look, Mr. Frost.

220
00:22:34,587 --> 00:22:38,216
It's such a big paper,
it would be a baby!

221
00:22:39,347 --> 00:22:42,339
Wonderfully, we will find
something good for you.

222
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:44,737
I can make wheels too!

223
00:22:47,587 --> 00:22:50,659
- Do I have to do everything?
- But Mrs. Frost...

224
00:22:50,867 --> 00:22:53,335
Here it is so simple!

225
00:22:59,587 --> 00:23:02,465
Did you hit? Fortunately...

226
00:23:03,307 --> 00:23:06,219
- Sign here.
- I'm just singing.

227
00:23:06,547 --> 00:23:08,981
Okay, sign up!

228
00:23:13,587 --> 00:23:15,179
Hi Joe!

229
00:23:21,587 --> 00:23:24,340
You're gonna make me a star!

230
00:23:33,067 --> 00:23:35,900
I hope you do not mind
we came, bible Joy.

231
00:23:36,067 --> 00:23:39,377
Is the two-eyed? Good morning.

232
00:23:39,627 --> 00:23:42,786
Mattam Amavta I told you that
I'll pay you on Friday.

233
00:23:42,787 --> 00:23:44,666
Pay me?

234
00:23:44,667 --> 00:23:47,506
Let's not talk about it.

235
00:23:47,507 --> 00:23:51,466
Look what we brought you try it.

236
00:23:56,467 --> 00:23:59,906
We have the first dress
reminisce of Blue Moonlight.

237
00:23:59,907 --> 00:24:03,026
- Is not that great?
- Fantastic...

238
00:24:03,027 --> 00:24:06,622
You have to put it, it
will take you a lot.

239
00:24:07,587 --> 00:24:11,580
You have the right body,
your waist is so thin.

240
00:24:11,827 --> 00:24:15,376
- Do you agree with me?
- Of course, mawam.

241
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:18,897
We have other things you can
try it whenever you want.

242
00:24:21,787 --> 00:24:25,939
You did not forget to bring
the pink siffer...

243
00:24:27,387 --> 00:24:30,823
- Conviction?
- With the red poppy.

244
00:24:31,067 --> 00:24:33,865
It's great!

245
00:24:34,587 --> 00:24:38,216
It's so chic, you
wait a little...

246
00:24:39,347 --> 00:24:42,976
Here you are, fantastic!

247
00:24:43,467 --> 00:24:46,982
The color fits so well
with your skin!

248
00:24:48,747 --> 00:24:51,705
You do not have a mirror...

249
00:24:52,267 --> 00:24:56,465
You can see here.
What do you say?

250
00:24:57,947 --> 00:25:00,780
It's incredible!

251
00:25:02,707 --> 00:25:06,666
- What do you say about it?
- You do not understand...

252
00:25:07,187 --> 00:25:11,260
It's for you, from
the mawam Amamta.

253
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:18,066
- But I can never...
- I want you to fuck.

254
00:25:19,347 --> 00:25:22,986
The double jowe can put you
the silver beads.

255
00:25:22,987 --> 00:25:27,219
You are so smart,
that's what you think.

256
00:25:30,747 --> 00:25:35,537
Look what nice
which is the gouva.

257
00:25:36,387 --> 00:25:40,824
Do not say a word, I want to see you
and all the rest.

258
00:25:41,267 --> 00:25:45,666
- Mr. Frost told you...
- I do not know anything...

259
00:25:45,667 --> 00:25:49,296
is our little secret, okay?

260
00:25:51,147 --> 00:25:53,342
That's love!

261
00:25:53,907 --> 00:25:55,986
Come on, let's get you.

262
00:25:55,987 --> 00:25:58,266
You need to be honored be tired.

263
00:25:58,267 --> 00:26:01,346
If you want something else
phone me.

264
00:26:01,347 --> 00:26:04,259
- Promise it.
- I promise you.

265
00:26:04,467 --> 00:26:07,618
Too bad, thank you very much.

266
00:26:23,907 --> 00:26:27,866
- Is not it a nice day?
- Mallow...

267
00:26:37,947 --> 00:26:41,986
Fortunately you came, get it
a deep await and listen!

268
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:46,146
- I hear but I do not know...
- Frost gave me a contract!

269
00:26:46,147 --> 00:26:48,746
And the mawam Amvata
all these clothes!

270
00:26:48,747 --> 00:26:52,786
- And where are your stables?
- Please pay attention!

271
00:26:52,787 --> 00:26:55,306
Someone must stay reasonable!

272
00:26:55,307 --> 00:26:57,666
- What do they mean?
- You do not know?

273
00:26:57,667 --> 00:27:01,103
- Of course not!
- Savvet, you're a jerk!

274
00:27:01,987 --> 00:27:06,060
Me, do not begin to bear
and you are mad!

275
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:08,906
Until you desert
I will take out this dress.

276
00:27:08,907 --> 00:27:11,705
And I in your place
it will be the same.

277
00:27:11,907 --> 00:27:14,226
I do not know why you were so mad.

278
00:27:14,227 --> 00:27:16,826
You could say that
to your best friend!

279
00:27:16,827 --> 00:27:19,864
I'm trying to tell you
but do not listen!

280
00:27:21,187 --> 00:27:24,946
Well, tell me something
for Bij Giovanni.

281
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:28,746
- Who is he?
- Are you asking?

282
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:32,866
- Your trustee is!
- Are you crazy!

283
00:27:32,867 --> 00:27:36,026
Then everyone in the theater
they must be mad.

284
00:27:36,027 --> 00:27:40,346
I did not expect to know the new ones
last and let me be stuck!

285
00:27:40,347 --> 00:27:44,706
- I do not know what you say.
- So you're going to get it?

286
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:48,146
- And of course!
- Then I'll check it out...

287
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:51,378
Jacqueline Joeves
you are a junk!

288
00:27:54,187 --> 00:27:56,106
Everybody crazed!

289
00:27:56,107 --> 00:28:00,986
Why did Frost star you?
And you old man sends you these?

290
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:04,426
- I do not know, why?
- Because of Bij Giovanni!

291
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:07,986
You will tell me please
Who is this Bruno?

292
00:28:07,987 --> 00:28:12,066
He has made millions
with greeting cards.

293
00:28:12,067 --> 00:28:15,506
He is the richest in Scotland.

294
00:28:15,507 --> 00:28:19,506
- You're not telling me yet.
- Listen to you, Jacob...

295
00:28:19,507 --> 00:28:24,866
you swear in what you have a sanctuary
that you have not been betrothal?

296
00:28:24,867 --> 00:28:29,338
How do I get it?
When I do not know it?

297
00:28:34,427 --> 00:28:37,100
Where's the joke?

298
00:28:38,867 --> 00:28:41,939
Will you tell me why you laugh?

299
00:28:42,147 --> 00:28:46,746
You do not find it funny
make you expensive...

300
00:28:46,747 --> 00:28:50,342
and become a star because of it
someone you do not know?

301
00:28:51,547 --> 00:28:53,902
It's horrible...

302
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,346
Listen, Frost reminds me
that she is smart...

303
00:28:57,347 --> 00:29:00,866
make the star girl for you
get money from the developer.

304
00:29:00,867 --> 00:29:03,665
- You do not think that...
- She's gone.

305
00:29:03,867 --> 00:29:07,416
You want me to tell you how many stars
did I start in this way?

306
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,263
Come in.

307
00:29:13,467 --> 00:29:15,935
Miss Jowve?

308
00:29:16,707 --> 00:29:19,460
Sign Please.

309
00:29:22,747 --> 00:29:26,376
I do not believe it,
it's from Frost!

310
00:29:26,827 --> 00:29:30,024
Then you can get it!

311
00:29:32,867 --> 00:29:36,018
One minute, give them to me.

312
00:29:43,307 --> 00:29:46,706
How long do you pray
for something so wonderful?

313
00:29:46,707 --> 00:29:49,226
- Here it is!
- I do not want it in this way.

314
00:29:49,227 --> 00:29:53,186
How important is the way?
You will tell them all later.

315
00:29:53,467 --> 00:29:57,266
You did not tell Frost
that you are engaged, right?

316
00:29:57,267 --> 00:30:01,626
Neither in the mawam Amamta
that you have to pay.

317
00:30:01,627 --> 00:30:04,221
Why not enjoy it
how long do you keep?

318
00:30:28,147 --> 00:30:30,502
For Mrs. Bruno.

319
00:31:00,827 --> 00:31:03,546
For Mrs. Bruno.

320
00:31:08,267 --> 00:31:10,827
For Mrs. Bruno.

321
00:31:28,787 --> 00:31:31,266
Mavam Amatta Fashion House.

322
00:31:31,267 --> 00:31:33,827
Account, Jetwing Joe
Theater Mercury.

323
00:31:35,227 --> 00:31:38,506
- It's wrong!
- It's for Mr. Bruno.

324
00:31:38,507 --> 00:31:42,216
We know both of them
that is wrong!

325
00:31:52,827 --> 00:31:55,826
When I heard he visited you
this landlord...

326
00:31:55,827 --> 00:32:00,821
in the hour of work I was
outraged, not Harold!

327
00:32:01,267 --> 00:32:05,226
- I do not want to come back.
- Indeed, Mr. Bruno.

328
00:32:05,227 --> 00:32:09,546
There is also an annual one
excursion to these things.

329
00:32:09,547 --> 00:32:13,026
Harold, I do not want to be bothered
in one's personal life...

330
00:32:13,027 --> 00:32:16,940
but here in the company, I do
not want my employees to...

331
00:32:18,347 --> 00:32:21,817
- What is this?
- I have an account, sir.

332
00:32:24,227 --> 00:32:26,906
I do not want to be dismayed
work with pleasure.

333
00:32:26,907 --> 00:32:30,263
There are some rules...

334
00:32:35,307 --> 00:32:39,220
Things I want you to do
are respected. You can leave.

335
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:45,101
To see what this is...

336
00:32:45,747 --> 00:32:48,186
Fashion House, why
do you go to me?

337
00:32:48,187 --> 00:32:50,386
That's what I'm talking about and I, sir.

338
00:32:50,387 --> 00:32:54,826
Jacqueline Jowve, Mercury
silver beige and velvet...

339
00:32:54,827 --> 00:32:57,666
You are outrageous!
I have not been to the theater...

340
00:32:57,667 --> 00:33:01,785
and I do not know
this Joe, arrange it.

341
00:33:02,867 --> 00:33:07,258
- Why are you looking at me like that?
- How's that, sir?

342
00:33:07,467 --> 00:33:09,386
You think I have some
relationship with all this?

343
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:13,221
- You, sir? Of course not.
- Of course not.

344
00:33:13,427 --> 00:33:16,578
I knew it had happened
some mistake.

345
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:20,063
- How did you know that?
- You could not...

346
00:33:20,267 --> 00:33:23,466
- What can not I do?
- You would not!

347
00:33:23,467 --> 00:33:26,743
Of course not.
He called the phone.

348
00:33:29,987 --> 00:33:32,455
Office of Mr Bruno.

349
00:33:33,387 --> 00:33:35,617
Who are they?

350
00:33:37,507 --> 00:33:40,738
From Mercury Theater, for you.

351
00:33:44,027 --> 00:33:46,266
I have a wonderful new Mr. Bruno.

352
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:50,186
The Jvette Jowve
is the star of the project!

353
00:33:50,187 --> 00:33:52,866
You've gotten to the company
Brooke, you make a mistake.

354
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,466
It's not a mistake, I've been
watching it for a long time...

355
00:33:55,467 --> 00:33:57,059
we are changing the work for it.

356
00:33:59,187 --> 00:34:02,384
Is it going to be a thing of the past?
I do not know it!

357
00:34:04,067 --> 00:34:06,466
I understand, do not worry...

358
00:34:06,467 --> 00:34:09,027
your secret is yours
in good hands!

359
00:34:09,747 --> 00:34:11,863
Do you believe me now?

360
00:34:18,147 --> 00:34:20,183
Nato again!

361
00:34:20,427 --> 00:34:23,976
You were looking at me strangely,
I tell you that I do not know.

362
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:27,384
- Of course not.
- It's a farce...

363
00:34:28,387 --> 00:34:30,901
Something worse.

364
00:34:33,027 --> 00:34:36,417
In your place, I would be alert
the police force.

365
00:34:36,627 --> 00:34:38,986
I do not want you to be disappointed
in a spade the company.

366
00:34:38,987 --> 00:34:42,184
I will do it myself.

367
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:47,625
- Again I was looking at you strangely?
- Exactly.

368
00:34:48,947 --> 00:34:53,179
- I do not do it deliberately.
- I hope so.

369
00:34:56,267 --> 00:34:59,657
We will do it again
from start to finish.

370
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:02,423
Everyone in your positions.

371
00:35:05,747 --> 00:35:07,305
Let's go!

372
00:39:42,227 --> 00:39:46,505
Have a break, Joe.
It was good rehearsal.

373
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,505
I'm a lovely Javet.
I want to talk though...

374
00:39:53,707 --> 00:39:58,019
Thanks, I have a problem
in turns but I will fix it.

375
00:39:58,227 --> 00:40:01,856
I'm sure you were going
you rehearse in your suit.

376
00:40:03,547 --> 00:40:05,666
I have a prayer
with Jacqueline Jowve.

377
00:40:05,667 --> 00:40:08,306
Mr. Trezis is waiting
for you, go ahead.

378
00:40:09,947 --> 00:40:13,257
It will be a terrible sea bass, right?

379
00:40:13,827 --> 00:40:16,660
From a dancer to a star
within one day.

380
00:40:16,827 --> 00:40:18,658
I hope you are right.

381
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:29,106
- Who is he?
- From Morviv Express.

382
00:40:29,107 --> 00:40:33,339
- Wait a minute please?
- Yeah, I do not mind.

383
00:40:42,107 --> 00:40:44,906
Glad to see you, Treisse,
let's have a drink.

384
00:40:44,907 --> 00:40:47,506
- I'm waiting for Joe.
- You have an hour...

385
00:40:47,507 --> 00:40:50,340
must rehearse her suit, go.

386
00:40:54,307 --> 00:40:57,426
- You are welcome...
- I want ya yahoo.

387
00:40:57,427 --> 00:41:00,703
- He has a job, who are you?
- Mr. Bruno.

388
00:41:01,947 --> 00:41:05,462
- Bij Giovanni?
- Correctly.

389
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:10,980
Please, Mr. Bruno, go,
go to the camel 1.

390
00:41:26,147 --> 00:41:27,899
You can pass.

391
00:41:33,107 --> 00:41:36,383
- I'll send you a moment.
- It's okay now.

392
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:43,703
I'm sorry I am
with the suit, I'm very happy.

393
00:41:44,347 --> 00:41:46,786
I did not want to leave you
to wait...

394
00:41:46,787 --> 00:41:48,866
- Sit down please.
- Miss Jowve...

395
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:51,859
I came to clarify
a specific issue.

396
00:41:52,307 --> 00:41:55,583
To be honest...

397
00:41:58,267 --> 00:42:02,146
- Are you Jetway Jowve?
- Yes, you were disappointed?

398
00:42:02,467 --> 00:42:05,584
I was expecting something different.

399
00:42:06,587 --> 00:42:10,626
Sit please, must
I change you if you do not mind.

400
00:42:11,227 --> 00:42:14,697
- I'll wait outside.
- I can talk from here.

401
00:42:15,427 --> 00:42:18,305
And I thought you were going to be
different.

402
00:42:18,707 --> 00:42:22,177
- You say you were waiting for me?
- Of course...

403
00:42:25,707 --> 00:42:28,858
- Then you know why I came.
- Of course.

404
00:42:35,227 --> 00:42:39,584
- Why did you do it?
- I wanted to do it by little.

405
00:42:40,347 --> 00:42:43,339
- My dad was disturbing.
- And so it must!

406
00:42:44,547 --> 00:42:47,823
On the contrary, my mother encouraged me.

407
00:42:48,387 --> 00:42:51,146
You cheated on deceiving...

408
00:42:51,147 --> 00:42:55,186
I did not cheat, I said
that I want to be on the scene...

409
00:42:55,187 --> 00:42:57,940
- And I did it.
- Miss Jowve...

410
00:42:58,547 --> 00:43:01,226
this is not the explanation
which I expected.

411
00:43:01,227 --> 00:43:05,666
You want something more intriguing.
I can not believe it...

412
00:43:05,667 --> 00:43:08,346
when I said he would
Paul Tracy for interview...

413
00:43:08,347 --> 00:43:12,386
somewhat active
journalist but you...

414
00:43:12,907 --> 00:43:18,300
- Paul Tracy...
- Is not that your true one?

415
00:43:18,507 --> 00:43:21,897
It does not matter, I feel it
let me talk to you.

416
00:43:22,107 --> 00:43:27,227
Truth; And I do not feel
as uncomfortably as possible.

417
00:43:29,547 --> 00:43:32,425
I find you very...

418
00:43:33,107 --> 00:43:36,895
- What a nice guy!
- I'm glad you like it.

419
00:43:37,067 --> 00:43:39,820
I'm here this morning...

420
00:43:40,027 --> 00:43:42,826
joyful curtains
and the flowers help you, right?

421
00:43:42,827 --> 00:43:45,785
Truth; - Of course...

422
00:43:47,267 --> 00:43:50,782
- Do I start from the beginning?
- You are welcome!

423
00:43:51,267 --> 00:43:53,656
Do we sit back?

424
00:43:54,827 --> 00:43:59,855
- You wanna know where I came from?
- Yeah, I'd love to.

425
00:44:00,067 --> 00:44:03,104
I grew up in a small farm
in Virzivia...

426
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:06,066
Amazing! And I
in a farm I was born.

427
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:09,066
Not in Virzivia,
however, in Devosvir.

428
00:44:09,067 --> 00:44:10,946
Then I went to Haro...

429
00:44:10,947 --> 00:44:13,266
I left my sixties
because I did not know anything else...

430
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:16,426
my father had his own
ideas for life...

431
00:44:16,427 --> 00:44:19,666
Conspiracy but who gets it
what is it from?

432
00:44:19,667 --> 00:44:22,386
I was forgotten,
continued, please.

433
00:44:22,387 --> 00:44:27,146
The house was in the middle of
trifolias and mosses...

434
00:44:27,147 --> 00:44:31,777
in a small pond.
I get up very early in the morning...

435
00:44:32,907 --> 00:44:35,386
- And I was culling the cows.
- How many were you?

436
00:44:35,387 --> 00:44:37,696
Pevvvata.

437
00:44:39,147 --> 00:44:42,583
- Why are you smiling;
- Nothing, please go on.

438
00:44:42,787 --> 00:44:45,746
- Do not you believe me?
- I know of farms...

439
00:44:45,747 --> 00:44:49,106
- I have some.
- Do you have farms?

440
00:44:49,107 --> 00:44:53,020
I know many villagers
who are living in farms.

441
00:44:56,467 --> 00:45:00,546
Well, it was a simple one
home without trifolias.

442
00:45:00,547 --> 00:45:04,904
- There was no cow.
- And he did not go to Virgina!

443
00:45:05,107 --> 00:45:07,985
I'm from New Jerzy.

444
00:45:08,387 --> 00:45:11,546
It grew up in a fishing boat
in the Gulf of Mexico.

445
00:45:11,547 --> 00:45:14,386
Her mother was an artist
but she left her career...

446
00:45:14,387 --> 00:45:17,386
when he baptized the father
of Jacqueline, she loved it a lot.

447
00:45:17,387 --> 00:45:20,866
- He was a diver.
- How much is Bruno doing to you?

448
00:45:20,867 --> 00:45:24,906
Listen and the drama! Her boyfriend
she taught her everything she knew...

449
00:45:24,907 --> 00:45:28,066
when the storm was lost in the
storm and did not have a franc...

450
00:45:28,067 --> 00:45:30,666
where you find what he did
the poor girl or the girl.

451
00:45:30,667 --> 00:45:33,226
He left and found
the Bij Giovanni.

452
00:45:33,227 --> 00:45:35,582
Have a drink!

453
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:40,061
- Luckily my luck changed.
- Wonderful how did it happen?

454
00:45:42,587 --> 00:45:46,023
It was from hard work
or from gossip?

455
00:45:46,427 --> 00:45:48,746
What exactly do you do?

456
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:51,906
I'm afraid you know
somev with power...

457
00:45:51,907 --> 00:45:57,027
- Do you think specifically?
- Some Mr Bruno...

458
00:45:57,227 --> 00:46:00,856
Avarothomomv when
we would get to this point!

459
00:46:01,307 --> 00:46:02,986
I just wanted to know...

460
00:46:02,987 --> 00:46:06,306
There is nothing in between
to me and Bruno.

461
00:46:06,307 --> 00:46:09,663
- You do not believe it.
- And I believe it!

462
00:46:10,587 --> 00:46:14,186
I'm bored with these rumors
for me and Bruno.

463
00:46:14,187 --> 00:46:17,816
Truth; I am glad.
Where did you know?

464
00:46:20,387 --> 00:46:23,777
We were celebrating a party
last winter.

465
00:46:24,067 --> 00:46:28,146
It's been in Egypt last year
the winter I know.

466
00:46:28,147 --> 00:46:32,265
It is not in Egypt the weather;

467
00:46:32,467 --> 00:46:36,946
- Yeah, that's where I was.
- There we know...

468
00:46:36,947 --> 00:46:39,786
- On pyramids.
- On pyramids?

469
00:46:39,787 --> 00:46:44,542
I turn on the pyramids,
a little left...

470
00:46:48,027 --> 00:46:50,626
Boredom in Hawaii...

471
00:46:50,627 --> 00:46:54,906
- I immediately fell in love.
- Were a Hawaiian skirt?

472
00:46:54,907 --> 00:46:59,386
I'm trying to tell you the story
and you do not keep notes.

473
00:46:59,387 --> 00:47:04,700
I remember them, but you too
I forgot to put my own.

474
00:47:05,867 --> 00:47:09,985
Do not be angry, I had to know
for Seva and Bruno.

475
00:47:10,187 --> 00:47:13,226
I know, you have to do it
your job like me.

476
00:47:13,227 --> 00:47:17,346
What does it interest you?
Choir and old man?

477
00:47:17,347 --> 00:47:20,544
- Hoover?
- She wears glasses.

478
00:47:23,827 --> 00:47:26,906
Coming right up. You must
I put the rehearsal clothes on.

479
00:47:26,907 --> 00:47:30,263
I want to know more.

480
00:47:30,467 --> 00:47:33,386
We can meet
for a meal at Aperitiv?

481
00:47:33,387 --> 00:47:36,618
Who do you think you are?
Bij Giovanni?

482
00:47:36,827 --> 00:47:39,421
Do not worry, I have economies.

483
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:43,816
You do not have to go for
food. Close the zipper.

484
00:47:45,067 --> 00:47:48,706
We can meet
away from the theater.

485
00:47:48,707 --> 00:47:52,256
You're coming out! Sorry...

486
00:47:56,187 --> 00:47:58,417
- At one.
- Okay!

487
00:48:00,787 --> 00:48:04,186
You promise not to write
for the Bruno...

488
00:48:04,187 --> 00:48:08,021
- It would be totally...
- Completely!

489
00:48:37,107 --> 00:48:39,143
Good morning Fraser.

490
00:48:40,227 --> 00:48:42,343
- For you!
- Thanks.

491
00:49:04,627 --> 00:49:07,226
Good morning how are you today;

492
00:49:07,227 --> 00:49:10,537
How are you? Good morning.

493
00:49:11,267 --> 00:49:13,861
I want to talk to you.

494
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:26,786
Mr. Dot, have you ever thought
that something is missing from the office?

495
00:49:26,787 --> 00:49:30,586
- No, Mr. Bruno.
- He misses the charm.

496
00:49:30,587 --> 00:49:34,306
Nothing is charming even you.

497
00:49:34,307 --> 00:49:38,585
- I'm very sorry.
- It is not your fault...

498
00:49:39,347 --> 00:49:43,465
we need to change something.
Life is a strange thing.

499
00:49:43,667 --> 00:49:47,103
How to work people
in such an environment?

500
00:49:47,507 --> 00:49:51,466
We need something over
there, over there...

501
00:49:54,667 --> 00:49:57,977
Flowers, lots of flowers
this is needed!

502
00:49:58,267 --> 00:50:00,946
- Flowers, Mr. Bruno?
- Of course...

503
00:50:00,947 --> 00:50:03,426
joyful curtains
and the flowers help...

504
00:50:03,427 --> 00:50:05,786
- Is not that the case?
- Truth;

505
00:50:05,787 --> 00:50:08,666
We went to the routine, the office
reminds a vampire!

506
00:50:08,667 --> 00:50:11,545
There's something about it, about it
and that!

507
00:50:17,907 --> 00:50:21,226
It is her lucky maneuver
Jacqueline Jowve at Mercury.

508
00:50:21,227 --> 00:50:25,505
Yesterday dancer, today star
tomorrow a possible vague!

509
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:29,346
We will not say who he is
the lucky millionaire...

510
00:50:29,347 --> 00:50:33,625
but Javen will receive
many greeting cards!

511
00:50:33,787 --> 00:50:35,584
Give me this!

512
00:50:45,347 --> 00:50:48,466
Good man this master Treis...

513
00:50:48,467 --> 00:50:53,226
- Yes very much.
- With charm and compassion.

514
00:50:53,227 --> 00:50:57,345
Yes why; - Take a look here.

515
00:51:02,147 --> 00:51:03,944
Come in.

516
00:51:05,067 --> 00:51:09,857
Are you stingy? When I do
Something perfect, look!

517
00:51:10,427 --> 00:51:14,306
- Is not that nice?
- Yeah, who are they?

518
00:51:14,787 --> 00:51:18,097
- For your sake and yours.
- Someone and what?

519
00:51:18,347 --> 00:51:20,586
They're the scouts
for your new look.

520
00:51:20,587 --> 00:51:23,346
Especially made for the little one
Lady of Bruo!

521
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:26,817
- Will not he please?
- It will burst out of pleasure!

522
00:51:28,467 --> 00:51:31,266
K. Frost I think it is
better to tell you...

523
00:51:31,267 --> 00:51:34,746
Later, we will say it tonight
at the dinner.

524
00:51:34,747 --> 00:51:38,826
- Do you want to have dinner together?
- I'd love to, but...

525
00:51:38,827 --> 00:51:42,740
Cancel all your plans, bring Mr.
Bruno.

526
00:51:45,307 --> 00:51:48,786
I want to talk to him about the
show, you can come and you...

527
00:51:48,787 --> 00:51:51,824
- Being four.
- You put it well.

528
00:51:52,147 --> 00:51:55,346
I'm sure Mr. Bruno
would you like to come...

529
00:51:55,347 --> 00:51:59,181
- But he's missing out on the city.
- We'll be out tomorrow.

530
00:51:59,587 --> 00:52:02,738
- Come on, come on.
- Great!

531
00:52:03,307 --> 00:52:06,504
I'm going now because
I have a job, hello.

532
00:52:11,947 --> 00:52:15,781
- Again in front of my legs?
- I need to talk to you...

533
00:52:15,987 --> 00:52:18,986
Tomorrow my love, tomorrow!
Where do you go?

534
00:52:18,987 --> 00:52:22,104
- From here...
- Nice!

535
00:52:36,907 --> 00:52:40,026
You lasted only half an hour,
you are very conspicuous.

536
00:52:40,027 --> 00:52:43,576
And you are worthy of contempt!

537
00:52:45,267 --> 00:52:49,021
- The house sculpture...
- I'm heading your column.

538
00:52:55,227 --> 00:53:00,620
You promised not to write
nothing but the one you have.

539
00:53:01,307 --> 00:53:04,466
- I did not write it!
- Then who wrote it?

540
00:53:04,467 --> 00:53:07,146
It could have been anyone.

541
00:53:07,147 --> 00:53:10,503
- Do you swear to me?
- I swear.

542
00:53:11,507 --> 00:53:16,217
How happy I am! I did not believe how
you could do it!

543
00:53:17,587 --> 00:53:21,057
- Did not you believe it?
- No...

544
00:53:21,387 --> 00:53:25,266
- I thought you were good.
- Good coincidence...

545
00:53:25,467 --> 00:53:28,386
Good morning, you want
the best deal?

546
00:53:28,387 --> 00:53:31,026
- Yes thank you.
- And you, sir?

547
00:53:33,707 --> 00:53:37,256
- You speak.
- I'll get what the lady gets.

548
00:53:37,667 --> 00:53:40,226
- Do you want to share it?
- Absolutely.

549
00:53:40,227 --> 00:53:42,536
Will you drink something; - Shabava.

550
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:44,857
Tea, Sali.

551
00:53:46,267 --> 00:53:49,225
Will we finish the interview?

552
00:53:50,147 --> 00:53:52,297
Yes, the interview...

553
00:53:53,507 --> 00:53:56,226
Tell me now... You have... you are...

554
00:53:56,427 --> 00:53:59,863
- Ring ringing?
- I'm not engaged.

555
00:54:00,307 --> 00:54:05,017
Congratulations!
You are not engaged.

556
00:54:05,507 --> 00:54:08,946
I started dancing at the theater
at my 16th...

557
00:54:08,947 --> 00:54:11,026
but last winter
I did not find a job...

558
00:54:11,027 --> 00:54:14,656
- And I worked as a waitress.
- Last winter?

559
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:19,146
- Before or after Egypt?
- Before I go to Egypt.

560
00:54:19,147 --> 00:54:22,856
That's where you knew Bruno
and he immediately prompted you.

561
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:26,386
- He did not do that!
- You must be crazy.

562
00:54:26,387 --> 00:54:29,226
Except for an old man and a son.

563
00:54:29,227 --> 00:54:32,186
Let me tell you how I found
my first job?

564
00:54:32,187 --> 00:54:35,226
The meaning of the original Bi Ji?

565
00:54:35,227 --> 00:54:39,937
Bijji... does not want to talk
which is why it is very fragile.

566
00:54:40,147 --> 00:54:44,459
Honest, old man, chore
and crazy. Nice pictures!

567
00:54:45,067 --> 00:54:49,265
- He's a good man.
- Where does he stay?

568
00:54:49,547 --> 00:54:53,506
I went to my first tour
by keeping a score.

569
00:54:53,507 --> 00:54:57,426
- Where does it stay?
- Jimmy...

570
00:54:57,427 --> 00:55:02,581
it is difficult to remember,
he always sends his chauffeur.

571
00:55:07,507 --> 00:55:10,579
I had no idea it was so
late, it came too...

572
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:12,420
I have to leave.

573
00:55:16,907 --> 00:55:19,866
It's the bizhiro chai
I do not have to wait for me.

574
00:55:19,867 --> 00:55:22,666
I still have a lot of questions.

575
00:55:22,667 --> 00:55:26,785
- I am sorry.
- Will you be at the same time tomorrow?

576
00:55:27,507 --> 00:55:31,056
All right, Mr. Paul.

577
00:55:51,587 --> 00:55:55,136
It's too high, swamps
back on the table.

578
00:56:02,867 --> 00:56:06,177
- Much better.
- Will you see Bayt now?

579
00:56:06,427 --> 00:56:09,180
Yes, you were in.

580
00:56:14,987 --> 00:56:17,501
- You can pass.
- Thanks.

581
00:56:21,427 --> 00:56:24,146
- You can talk, Bates.
- Mr...

582
00:56:24,147 --> 00:56:27,346
You got an idiot with the car
by Mr Bruno.

583
00:56:27,347 --> 00:56:30,306
Yes, she was late and afraid
she would lose her job.

584
00:56:30,307 --> 00:56:33,066
And you got it with the car.
An ignorant whole...

585
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:36,146
you did not know what it was.
And it did not have to be good...

586
00:56:36,147 --> 00:56:39,346
after he accepted to come in
in the car of one ignorant.

587
00:56:39,347 --> 00:56:43,306
Let us not characterize
some that we do not know.

588
00:56:43,787 --> 00:56:46,546
It was very good and very beautiful.

589
00:56:46,547 --> 00:56:50,586
Sure, I think
you took the opportunity.

590
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:54,183
- I do not like what you say.
- Confession...

591
00:56:54,387 --> 00:56:56,901
but I know exactly what happened!

592
00:56:57,147 --> 00:57:00,423
Bates said he was good
girl and I know it is.

593
00:57:00,747 --> 00:57:04,786
- It will be!
- You will do the same.

594
00:57:04,787 --> 00:57:09,656
Right, I just wanted to know
because you went to the theater yesterday.

595
00:57:10,907 --> 00:57:15,822
For the call, the
he had to submit.

596
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:21,306
You used the car
to your advantage...

597
00:57:21,307 --> 00:57:25,466
and you serve ignorant
women. You need to know...

598
00:57:25,467 --> 00:57:29,858
that this matter has
Mr Grove's dissatisfaction.

599
00:57:31,987 --> 00:57:34,386
Yes it is serious...

600
00:57:34,387 --> 00:57:37,386
I do not want to feel that
I was cheating on my employees.

601
00:57:37,387 --> 00:57:41,306
That's why Beits, I express
the view of Mr Bruno...

602
00:57:41,307 --> 00:57:44,583
and I have to tell you
that we are sorry but...

603
00:57:46,067 --> 00:57:49,104
Come, I came to the accountants.

604
00:57:50,547 --> 00:57:57,180
- Sorry...
- You bet your trust...

605
00:57:57,507 --> 00:58:02,786
I keep on it
to double your salary.

606
00:58:05,987 --> 00:58:09,146
- I forgot my papers.
- Being a lesson for you.

607
00:58:09,147 --> 00:58:12,025
Nothing, my decision
is definitive.

608
00:58:21,667 --> 00:58:24,466
- What are you doing?
- We get the dresses again.

609
00:58:24,467 --> 00:58:27,937
- Who said take them?
- Mr. Jostol, it's in.

610
00:58:30,667 --> 00:58:34,026
- Fortunately you came!
- One minute gentlemen...

611
00:58:34,027 --> 00:58:36,706
tomorrow we have a premiere, you said
how will you give me time.

612
00:58:36,707 --> 00:58:39,226
The time is over
you do not have money as usual.

613
00:58:39,227 --> 00:58:42,666
You know he supports me
you are very rich from here!

614
00:58:42,667 --> 00:58:45,746
We do not want other excuses
and lies, it's too late!

615
00:58:45,747 --> 00:58:49,066
- What lies?
- You are missing the moral, Mr. Frost.

616
00:58:49,067 --> 00:58:51,626
You heard me talking
with the Bruno, right?

617
00:58:51,627 --> 00:58:54,983
I did the star girl,
is not that ethical?

618
00:58:56,747 --> 00:58:59,186
Find Jacqueline and send it
in my office.

619
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:01,426
- Why do not you pay us then?
- These things...

620
00:59:01,427 --> 00:59:03,786
you want time, you know how
are the lawyers!

621
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:06,506
Come a little in my office
I want to show you something.

622
00:59:09,827 --> 00:59:13,536
- Jacket, you want Mr. Frost.
- I am coming.

623
00:59:14,187 --> 00:59:16,546
They're the scouts
for the new life.

624
00:59:16,547 --> 00:59:19,666
Imagine how much you will enjoy
when do you make it?

625
00:59:19,667 --> 00:59:22,226
- When do I fix it?
- Of course...

626
00:59:22,227 --> 00:59:25,826
you remark that I am ungrateful
and will I give it to another?

627
00:59:25,827 --> 00:59:30,306
You're asking me to make a sculpture
the moment I get the others?

628
00:59:30,307 --> 00:59:34,506
- I'm not sick!
- I'm sewing other costumes!

629
00:59:34,507 --> 00:59:37,426
- Did you ask me Mr. Frost?
- Savvet, my dear...

630
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:41,186
Mr. Jostol and his friends.
I told them about our plans...

631
00:59:41,187 --> 00:59:44,546
for our despatch dinner
with your creator.

632
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:48,301
We will discuss the latter
details of the show.

633
00:59:49,107 --> 00:59:53,737
- Yes correctly.
- Where will you go for dinner?

634
00:59:55,907 --> 00:59:58,746
- In Bov Vivier.
- We'll be there.

635
00:59:58,747 --> 01:00:02,466
- Okay, will you leave the scouts?
- Why do you get them?

636
01:00:02,467 --> 01:00:06,066
We'll see how the evening will go.

637
01:00:06,067 --> 01:00:08,346
Thanks, just a little while!

638
01:00:08,347 --> 01:00:11,146
You can not make it
without the model.

639
01:00:11,147 --> 01:00:13,615
Thanks, that's it.

640
01:00:15,347 --> 01:00:17,542
You were going to get the scouts.

641
01:00:20,147 --> 01:00:23,105
That's what we're going to do!

642
01:00:23,627 --> 01:00:26,506
Look at Mr. Frost I'm afraid
how are you sick?

643
01:00:26,507 --> 01:00:29,346
I look at your big one
opportunity, is not it?

644
01:00:29,347 --> 01:00:31,786
You have to do it too
something for me.

645
01:00:31,787 --> 01:00:36,815
- Convince Bruno to come.
- I can not, it is missing and...

646
01:00:37,027 --> 01:00:39,986
He turned, I saw his chauffeur
yesterday in court.

647
01:00:39,987 --> 01:00:43,457
Javet, you'll save the show
your career is disturbing.

648
01:00:43,707 --> 01:00:47,066
- I can not do it!
- I have to risk them all!

649
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:50,616
Think of the children that are based
at this premiere.

650
01:00:51,147 --> 01:00:54,666
You are a good girl, I know
that you will not disappoint us.

651
01:00:54,667 --> 01:00:57,625
He went quickly
to bribe it with Brubo.

652
01:01:02,267 --> 01:01:04,546
- Did you finish?
- Yes finally.

653
01:01:04,547 --> 01:01:07,186
You have to go back inside.

654
01:01:10,227 --> 01:01:14,345
This is Jimmy, but
do not do it because it stutters.

655
01:01:15,347 --> 01:01:19,266
How about Ritchie?
It looks like a millionaire.

656
01:01:19,267 --> 01:01:22,339
I can not do it.

657
01:01:22,547 --> 01:01:27,575
After you promised the Bruno
you have to show it!

658
01:01:27,787 --> 01:01:31,106
- I'll tell the truth!
- Will you miss the opportunity?

659
01:01:31,107 --> 01:01:36,386
I come from my body, calm down
and chose a mistress!

660
01:01:39,067 --> 01:01:42,866
- We do not know how it is!
- She's 35 with a mustache.

661
01:01:42,867 --> 01:01:45,706
- How do you know;
- It was simple, Watsov.

662
01:01:45,707 --> 01:01:48,866
I got his secretary and I said
that I was writing an article...

663
01:01:48,867 --> 01:01:51,426
for wealthy men
and their hobbies.

664
01:01:51,427 --> 01:01:54,466
- What's his hobby?
- His job.

665
01:01:54,467 --> 01:01:58,665
Then we need some
serious master.

666
01:01:59,907 --> 01:02:03,661
- He looks rich.
- He just went bankrupt.

667
01:02:05,307 --> 01:02:07,377
It is worthwhile.

668
01:02:15,227 --> 01:02:17,866
- Hey, Paul.
- I got some flowers.

669
01:02:18,067 --> 01:02:22,458
- It's a great Paul.
- How are you;

670
01:02:23,227 --> 01:02:27,186
You have not known yourself.
This is Mei.

671
01:02:28,867 --> 01:02:32,626
I see so much for the first time
flowers, where did you find them?

672
01:02:32,627 --> 01:02:35,746
- A shop.
- What did you do, fuck you?

673
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:38,826
- I do not understand...
- Do not listen to what he says.

674
01:02:38,827 --> 01:02:41,978
Will you put them in a vase?

675
01:02:42,627 --> 01:02:46,859
Well, you do not have to spend
in such things.

676
01:02:47,467 --> 01:02:50,698
I saw them in the vitriva
as it comes to...

677
01:03:00,307 --> 01:03:05,146
Bij Giovanni!
What are you doing, Mr. Bruno?

678
01:03:05,147 --> 01:03:08,866
- You're crazy, we can not!
- Why not;

679
01:03:08,867 --> 01:03:12,386
You want to save
the career of Jacqueth?

680
01:03:12,387 --> 01:03:17,142
You can make it
that you are Brueve?

681
01:03:17,827 --> 01:03:21,615
I will not allow it.
We may be in trouble.

682
01:03:22,747 --> 01:03:27,741
It's simple, we'll get out
for dinner with Frost.

683
01:03:27,947 --> 01:03:30,859
Very nice, supposed
how am I going to be Bruve?

684
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:34,696
Frost wants you to know
but it is missing.

685
01:03:34,907 --> 01:03:39,139
- Where is this time?
- In Monte Carlo.

686
01:03:41,707 --> 01:03:45,256
- Will you do it?
- Of course!

687
01:03:46,107 --> 01:03:49,736
It's not easy to be present
somebody else, Paul.

688
01:03:50,547 --> 01:03:53,706
- Do you think you can?
- I will try.

689
01:03:53,707 --> 01:03:57,620
To ask something, do you
have an evening suit?

690
01:03:57,947 --> 01:04:01,496
Is it good? It is
some glossy greens?

691
01:04:01,667 --> 01:04:04,386
- No, not...
- Nice, you're getting involved.

692
01:04:06,867 --> 01:04:09,665
Come on, sit down
for information now.

693
01:04:12,347 --> 01:04:17,785
Savo Bruno, supposed
that you know all the social.

694
01:04:18,307 --> 01:04:21,666
You will talk about the villa and
your yacht in Moûte Carlo.

695
01:04:21,667 --> 01:04:24,386
- Do I have a yacht?
- You two have!

696
01:04:24,387 --> 01:04:29,106
Do not forget that you are
rich, you are not Paul...

697
01:04:29,107 --> 01:04:32,861
- You must be cynical.
- And somehow it's a bitch.

698
01:04:33,227 --> 01:04:36,306
- You must buy and cigar.
- No, I do not.

699
01:04:36,307 --> 01:04:39,546
All Millionaires smoke cigar.

700
01:04:39,547 --> 01:04:42,266
- All the time!
- I will try.

701
01:04:43,307 --> 01:04:48,017
- You are very sweet Paul.
- I'll do the fuck for a seve.

702
01:04:48,507 --> 01:04:52,022
We do not have time for
these, we have to get ready.

703
01:04:52,507 --> 01:04:56,739
- What time do we start?
- Come on, get us at ten.

704
01:04:57,067 --> 01:04:59,342
We have to hurry.

705
01:05:00,907 --> 01:05:04,706
- Enterprise Brubo!
- Tell me more...

706
01:05:04,707 --> 01:05:08,017
I'm not Paul Tracy,
I'm Bij Giovanni.

707
01:05:09,787 --> 01:05:13,097
Horrified, he was going home
practice.

708
01:05:14,427 --> 01:05:17,746
I think we did a big mistake.

709
01:05:17,747 --> 01:05:22,025
He is the most unconvincing
I've never seen me!

710
01:05:22,747 --> 01:05:25,784
I'm Bij Giovanni.

711
01:05:33,307 --> 01:05:34,979
I am;

712
01:06:12,387 --> 01:06:16,786
Do not be nervous, say that
you are sympathetic to these.

713
01:06:16,787 --> 01:06:21,338
- I will try.
- I still say it was wrong.

714
01:06:21,907 --> 01:06:24,944
- Mr Frost's table?
- From here, sir.

715
01:06:36,667 --> 01:06:39,500
Mr. Frost's table.

716
01:06:40,467 --> 01:06:43,857
When you come to tell him
where we sit.

717
01:06:48,507 --> 01:06:51,579
- I am very good.
- That's what I'm saying.

718
01:07:00,227 --> 01:07:02,343
Look!

719
01:07:04,947 --> 01:07:07,780
Good morning Mr.
Frost, please be here.

720
01:07:08,107 --> 01:07:11,226
- Do not worry, okay?
- And do not talk too much...

721
01:07:11,227 --> 01:07:13,821
otherwise you cheat
to reveal it all.

722
01:07:14,027 --> 01:07:18,498
- You 're Jim Brouwo.
- Mr. Bruno do not get up...

723
01:07:19,587 --> 01:07:23,375
I wanted to show you how much
I love Scotland with the kilts.

724
01:07:24,747 --> 01:07:29,218
- I hear a lot about you, Mr.
- And I wanted to know.

725
01:07:33,107 --> 01:07:36,782
Bjhi just turned around
from Monte Carlo.

726
01:07:38,947 --> 01:07:42,066
- Yes, with the yacht.
- Bingo cigarettes?

727
01:07:42,067 --> 01:07:46,345
- Do not you smoke a cigar?
- I forgot them.

728
01:07:46,587 --> 01:07:49,866
- He prefers cigars.
- Take one of my own.

729
01:07:49,867 --> 01:07:52,825
- No thanks.
- Come my love.

730
01:07:57,987 --> 01:08:00,586
What will we take;

731
01:08:00,587 --> 01:08:03,106
Do you want to start with caviar?

732
01:08:03,107 --> 01:08:06,224
- Caviar; Wonderful!
- I don't like it.

733
01:08:07,187 --> 01:08:11,026
It has been overestimated
and it's very expensive.

734
01:08:11,027 --> 01:08:14,861
Millionaire you are,
why are you worried?

735
01:08:16,107 --> 01:08:19,417
- What do you say about oysters?
- I would like a soup.

736
01:08:19,827 --> 01:08:23,103
Do not listen to it, it loves it
the oysters, so my love?

737
01:08:26,187 --> 01:08:30,226
He is so rich
who forgets what he has!

738
01:08:31,987 --> 01:08:36,458
- Lobster, duck...
- I want a simple scramble.

739
01:08:37,507 --> 01:08:42,297
Omelette; - Stop it!

740
01:08:42,707 --> 01:08:46,939
Excuse me, that's it
our favorite song.

741
01:08:52,227 --> 01:08:54,263
It's a perfect couple.

742
01:08:57,907 --> 01:09:01,582
- You're not trying at all, Paul.
- But I try.

743
01:09:01,787 --> 01:09:04,347
- Do you know what a problem I have?
- No what;

744
01:09:04,547 --> 01:09:07,226
Please tell me my love.

745
01:09:07,227 --> 01:09:11,066
You have your mind what you do.

746
01:09:11,067 --> 01:09:14,696
- You 're Jim Brouwo.
- I'm Bij Giovanni!

747
01:09:18,707 --> 01:09:21,306
And for dessert, crepe sugeette.

748
01:09:21,307 --> 01:09:26,017
Bring and saber. It is
Brouvo very charming.

749
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:29,461
It does not seem like that
he is a millionaire.

750
01:09:41,307 --> 01:09:44,344
Who is the gentleman
on Mr. Frost's table?

751
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:47,778
Dancing with the girl
with the blue dress.

752
01:09:47,987 --> 01:09:50,899
- It's Mr Bij Giovanni.
- Thanks.

753
01:09:51,747 --> 01:09:55,342
I wanted to make sure
that he told us the truth.

754
01:10:00,787 --> 01:10:03,466
Try to do it too
you say what you need, Paul.

755
01:10:03,467 --> 01:10:07,346
- I'll make the oath for a seve.
- Do not forget who you are!

756
01:10:09,427 --> 01:10:13,136
Jostol was impressed
I see it, all goes well!

757
01:10:15,227 --> 01:10:19,106
Mr Bruvo, sit down
my three friends there...

758
01:10:19,107 --> 01:10:22,702
I'm sure you think
you're financing me.

759
01:10:23,067 --> 01:10:26,346
I've been thinking about investing
a few thousand at the theater.

760
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:29,976
My love, we have to dance
and in this song!

761
01:10:30,307 --> 01:10:32,025
Excuse me!

762
01:10:36,187 --> 01:10:39,384
- Nice time pick!
- Mr. Frost...

763
01:10:39,587 --> 01:10:43,026
you do not have to take it
money from Mrs. Bruno.

764
01:10:43,027 --> 01:10:47,543
- Why not;
- He doesn't know by show.

765
01:10:49,027 --> 01:10:53,543
Until we finish the dinner
he will know everything!

766
01:10:54,627 --> 01:10:57,386
I was trying to play
well my role.

767
01:10:57,387 --> 01:11:00,584
- You did the trick.
- I am sorry.

768
01:11:00,787 --> 01:11:04,186
You're very sweet
and I am yours...

769
01:11:04,187 --> 01:11:08,226
but you do not
for a millionaire.

770
01:11:09,667 --> 01:11:13,103
Maybe I had to wear it
false generic.

771
01:11:13,307 --> 01:11:16,697
It's what you say and do.

772
01:11:16,907 --> 01:11:20,217
I will do whatever you want
I'm going to fuck cigar too!

773
01:11:21,787 --> 01:11:25,382
Tell him to dance again
to grab it!

774
01:11:28,267 --> 01:11:32,306
- I have a good orchestra, right?
- You want to dance continuously!

775
01:11:34,587 --> 01:11:37,738
- Hello guys, are you leaving?
- We wanted to say hello.

776
01:11:37,947 --> 01:11:41,466
Do you say before? From here
Mr Bij Giovanni.

777
01:11:41,467 --> 01:11:44,426
I'm very happy, I'm learning that
your theater interests you.

778
01:11:44,427 --> 01:11:47,866
- Yeah, that's it.
- Will we see you in the theater then?

779
01:11:47,867 --> 01:11:50,786
- I hope so.
- Do not delay...

780
01:11:50,787 --> 01:11:54,700
- Do not worry about anything.
- We started the tents.

781
01:11:54,907 --> 01:11:57,740
Thank you very much, goodnight.

782
01:12:03,107 --> 01:12:07,146
You do not know how much I enjoyed being
you are interested in the show.

783
01:12:07,147 --> 01:12:11,026
If you come to my office
tomorrow, you will learn more.

784
01:12:11,187 --> 01:12:14,099
What do you call Bing?

785
01:12:15,427 --> 01:12:17,426
I'm trying to pull you
the attention...

786
01:12:17,427 --> 01:12:20,066
but you were not looking to me.

787
01:12:22,147 --> 01:12:25,346
Let me introduce you the promises
Joe and Tommsv...

788
01:12:25,347 --> 01:12:27,866
and Mrs. Frost. Lady Mavridv.

789
01:12:27,867 --> 01:12:30,106
- Nice to meet you.
- Likewise.

790
01:12:30,107 --> 01:12:33,026
Joe Frost, somewhere
I have heard the word.

791
01:12:33,027 --> 01:12:36,417
You may have read
for me at Varizete.

792
01:12:36,787 --> 01:12:39,426
I gave her a few pounds
to do that.

793
01:12:44,547 --> 01:12:48,266
Mr. Frost expects one
musical at the Mercury Theater.

794
01:12:48,267 --> 01:12:51,782
- Come on.
- Bring the duke.

795
01:12:54,667 --> 01:12:58,421
Paul paid him to do that.

796
01:12:58,867 --> 01:13:02,257
- I was glad to see you.
- I gotta get you.

797
01:13:02,467 --> 01:13:05,061
I was glad to know you.

798
01:13:15,667 --> 01:13:18,784
And Frost with the kilts...

799
01:13:18,987 --> 01:13:22,821
- It tries, though?
- Okay.

800
01:13:26,107 --> 01:13:29,026
Suppose I had a lot of money...

801
01:13:29,027 --> 01:13:31,746
I'll give you a shot
some in Frost?

802
01:13:31,747 --> 01:13:35,146
I think you are, I want
let me see it...

803
01:13:35,147 --> 01:13:38,906
it is also good for
even for one night.

804
01:13:38,907 --> 01:13:42,866
His creditors will shut him
if he does not pay them.

805
01:13:47,107 --> 01:13:50,782
I want to ask you something
for Bij Giovanni.

806
01:13:51,067 --> 01:13:54,503
Let's not talk about
it, help me come down.

807
01:13:55,867 --> 01:13:59,576
I want to talk about
it, it's important.

808
01:13:59,787 --> 01:14:03,302
Please, we're upset.

809
01:14:05,787 --> 01:14:08,347
Crushed with the Bruve?

810
01:14:09,387 --> 01:14:11,378
What is it about?

811
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:14,624
For you...

812
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:21,857
Bi Ji is jealous of you.

813
01:14:22,707 --> 01:14:25,506
It's ridiculous, I'll tell him
Tomorrow I'll see it.

814
01:14:25,507 --> 01:14:28,340
No Paul, please.

815
01:14:28,547 --> 01:14:32,460
- Thank you for everything.
- I'll explain everything to him.

816
01:14:33,867 --> 01:14:37,303
You would be very angry
if I told you...

817
01:14:38,227 --> 01:14:43,221
something I want to tell you,
I do not know the Bruno.

818
01:14:44,627 --> 01:14:48,620
I have not understood it,
understand me please.

819
01:14:52,387 --> 01:14:56,221
I want to tell you something about Jacob...

820
01:14:58,907 --> 01:15:01,346
from the moment I knew you
I want to dance, to sing...

821
01:15:01,347 --> 01:15:04,419
and climb to a clatter!

822
01:15:04,747 --> 01:15:07,625
Are you still there Javen?

823
01:15:07,827 --> 01:15:10,625
I have to tell you
something, listen to me!

824
01:15:12,867 --> 01:15:15,779
He wants to make it again.

825
01:15:21,507 --> 01:15:23,065
Goodnight.

826
01:15:28,027 --> 01:15:30,018
PREMIER APOPSE

827
01:15:40,227 --> 01:15:42,466
I told you a thousand times...

828
01:15:42,467 --> 01:15:45,937
that I do not want to talk
with the bank!

829
01:15:49,147 --> 01:15:52,423
Dear, goodbye to you
you passed by to see me.

830
01:15:53,347 --> 01:15:56,106
It was a strange thing,
just thinking about it.

831
01:15:56,107 --> 01:15:59,656
- I was looking at the bills...
- And you thought me?

832
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:03,546
I liked you a lot
from yesterday evening.

833
01:16:03,547 --> 01:16:06,106
- You have something special.
- I wonder what it is.

834
01:16:06,107 --> 01:16:09,306
I do not know but I think
how difficult it is...

835
01:16:09,307 --> 01:16:11,546
I have to leave you
invite you to the show.

836
01:16:11,547 --> 01:16:15,066
- Your kindness.
- It's a great opportunity...

837
01:16:15,067 --> 01:16:17,626
and it's simpler
from your own work.

838
01:16:17,627 --> 01:16:20,460
We do not buy paper
or write cards!

839
01:16:21,027 --> 01:16:25,464
Let's start a little
an amount of 3 thousand let's say...

840
01:16:26,027 --> 01:16:29,815
Two thousand? I can not
to take less than a thousand!

841
01:16:30,147 --> 01:16:32,615
- I've decided.
- Look here...

842
01:16:33,187 --> 01:16:36,463
we can do that
the amount every week.

843
01:16:36,987 --> 01:16:40,184
Then we will have the revenue
from songs and albums.

844
01:16:40,827 --> 01:16:44,058
When I make a decision
is definitive.

845
01:16:47,667 --> 01:16:50,977
You laugh, you know
what did I think I saw?

846
01:16:51,467 --> 01:16:55,779
- A check for 10 thousand.
- That's it.

847
01:17:01,747 --> 01:17:05,979
By Mrs. Frost, I do not
want Savvet to learn it.

848
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:09,538
I did, though, forgot it.

849
01:17:14,547 --> 01:17:17,698
You can forget it
and you want it!

850
01:17:25,987 --> 01:17:30,503
- What are you doing here Paul?
- I can not talk to you...

851
01:17:30,827 --> 01:17:33,261
I have a press conference.

852
01:17:41,067 --> 01:17:44,218
Take the bank, I want
let me speak to the governor.

853
01:17:45,107 --> 01:17:47,860
Yes, I told the bank.

854
01:17:48,267 --> 01:17:50,383
Change things!

855
01:17:53,707 --> 01:17:56,665
Come in, Javet!

856
01:17:57,667 --> 01:18:01,660
K. Frost, what did you do here?
Mr. Bruno?

857
01:18:01,867 --> 01:18:04,984
What everyone is doing
the millionaires.

858
01:18:06,587 --> 01:18:10,216
Send in Charlie, I want
to go to the bank.

859
01:18:10,667 --> 01:18:13,106
K. Frost must know...

860
01:18:13,107 --> 01:18:16,816
if he gave you the check
the one who left early.

861
01:18:17,027 --> 01:18:20,258
Mr Bruno and I did
an agreement and not...

862
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:22,981
It's not Mr. Bruno!

863
01:18:23,267 --> 01:18:25,186
- Did you ask me?
- Yes to me a favor...

864
01:18:25,187 --> 01:18:27,146
She went to the check
at the bank...

865
01:18:27,147 --> 01:18:30,059
and tell them to keep you
well the safe!

866
01:18:30,267 --> 01:18:33,020
Ten thousand pounds!

867
01:18:34,587 --> 01:18:36,986
You do not have to deposit
the check.

868
01:18:36,987 --> 01:18:39,746
You will be blamed for forgery.

869
01:18:39,747 --> 01:18:42,506
- Who me;
- It was not Bruno that.

870
01:18:42,507 --> 01:18:45,706
You are a journalist,
you are my friend.

871
01:18:45,707 --> 01:18:48,983
I do not know the Bruno!

872
01:18:52,067 --> 01:18:56,185
Tell this again, but
this time say it late!

873
01:18:56,627 --> 01:18:59,306
I have never known the Bruno...

874
01:18:59,307 --> 01:19:02,186
but when you persevere
to go out for dinner...

875
01:19:02,187 --> 01:19:05,145
I had to find something.

876
01:19:06,827 --> 01:19:11,503
- I'm sorry Mr. Frost.
- It does not matter to Savvett.

877
01:19:11,747 --> 01:19:16,346
- Will you forgive me?
- Yeah, forget it...

878
01:19:16,347 --> 01:19:19,384
you were going to get ready
for the rehearsal.

879
01:19:29,667 --> 01:19:32,986
Do not sit, he warned
Scott Jarvt!

880
01:19:32,987 --> 01:19:36,266
- You 're in Logviv.
- I want it!

881
01:19:36,267 --> 01:19:39,026
- Which category?
- Find one, impersonation...

882
01:19:39,027 --> 01:19:41,946
- Plastography, chaos!
- Mr. Frost...

883
01:19:41,947 --> 01:19:46,782
Sympathy, arson...
Get out in front of me!

884
01:19:47,347 --> 01:19:48,985
Dumbbell stab!

885
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:15,419
Wonderful work, worship!

886
01:27:15,627 --> 01:27:18,266
K. Frost this scammer
it's here, look!

887
01:27:21,467 --> 01:27:24,379
He has a lot of audacity,
he got the police fast!

888
01:27:24,587 --> 01:27:27,226
- Where's the police?
- Everywhere in the theater.

889
01:27:28,867 --> 01:27:31,745
- What are you going to do about Mr. Frost?
- Do not worry.

890
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:35,337
- You do not understand...
- You went to change yourself.

891
01:27:51,627 --> 01:27:54,778
- Where are we going;
- Do not ask, come with me!

892
01:28:11,027 --> 01:28:13,106
I loved it!

893
01:28:13,107 --> 01:28:16,266
- You gotta be crazy!
- Why, what do I have?

894
01:28:16,267 --> 01:28:19,339
- You have to leave quickly!
- Why;

895
01:28:21,827 --> 01:28:25,376
You're looking to fuck!
Quickly, out of the window!

896
01:28:27,027 --> 01:28:30,463
- You 're gonna get into a little alley.
- But I do not!

897
01:28:30,987 --> 01:28:34,502
Fly and leave?
Do I have to do everything?

898
01:28:35,067 --> 01:28:37,706
Take the key of my house
you were going to hide there.

899
01:28:37,707 --> 01:28:40,016
I want to see the rest of the show!

900
01:28:40,267 --> 01:28:43,026
He runs you all over
the Scottish police!

901
01:28:43,027 --> 01:28:46,019
- Why are you headed?
- For the fake check!

902
01:29:22,467 --> 01:29:25,106
Do not worry, he's my friend.

903
01:29:25,627 --> 01:29:27,506
What are you doing here?

904
01:29:27,507 --> 01:29:31,066
- I want to go to the theater!
- To enter;

905
01:29:31,067 --> 01:29:34,059
Are you crazy; You have to leave!

906
01:29:35,107 --> 01:29:39,180
Girls, take out the robes
and put your costumes!

907
01:29:41,547 --> 01:29:45,460
What is happening?
Whatever I say to you!

908
01:29:49,107 --> 01:29:51,667
That's it.

909
01:29:53,107 --> 01:29:56,656
- You have to leave quickly.
- Is there no other way out?

910
01:30:51,027 --> 01:30:53,826
I do not want to bother but
I have to explain something to you.

911
01:30:53,827 --> 01:30:56,186
I did not give a fake check
in the Frost...

912
01:30:56,187 --> 01:30:58,866
because I am Bij Giovanni.

913
01:30:58,867 --> 01:31:01,706
I hear Paul Tracy, I'm
trying to help you...

914
01:31:01,707 --> 01:31:05,546
if you do not want it,
but think of me too.

915
01:31:05,547 --> 01:31:09,859
- It's my premiere.
- I can prove it.

916
01:31:10,107 --> 01:31:12,386
He looked at the door
and tell them to me.

917
01:31:12,387 --> 01:31:14,306
- I can not do it!
- Why;

918
01:31:14,307 --> 01:31:16,423
Why do I love you, goddess!

919
01:31:17,107 --> 01:31:18,779
Say it again!

920
01:31:20,547 --> 01:31:23,226
Please, please
what I'm telling you!

921
01:31:23,227 --> 01:31:26,866
- Okay, but I'm the Bruno!
- Get out of the window!

922
01:31:26,867 --> 01:31:29,859
I'll go in again
to see the rest of the show.

923
01:31:34,427 --> 01:31:38,102
And then I want the show
let me know you the devil.

924
01:31:40,227 --> 01:31:43,706
- One minute.
- You have to come to the department.

925
01:31:43,707 --> 01:31:46,505
- Can I explain...
- I'm sorry, lady.

926
01:31:49,267 --> 01:31:51,986
- Good kids kids.
- Good inspector.

927
01:31:52,187 --> 01:31:54,985
K. Bruno I am very sorry.

928
01:31:55,187 --> 01:31:57,786
Do not start with
yourself, it's not Bruno!

929
01:31:57,787 --> 01:32:00,460
- And yet...
- I know so many years.

930
01:32:01,667 --> 01:32:04,625
You are the real;

931
01:32:04,827 --> 01:32:08,058
- The check is...
- And of course it is.

932
01:32:09,827 --> 01:32:13,661
- Where are they? I lost it...
- You better find her!

933
01:32:19,907 --> 01:32:23,582
- Do you believe me now?
- Get out of Jacqueline!

934
01:32:26,107 --> 01:32:29,586
This is terrible, Paul
is Bij Giovanni!

935
01:32:29,587 --> 01:32:32,579
What does it look like?
You go for your mind!

936
01:32:38,667 --> 01:32:41,586
- Do not bump, leave!
- I found this and...

937
01:32:41,587 --> 01:32:44,666
My check! You found her,
you are a wonderful girl!

938
01:32:44,667 --> 01:32:48,626
- I have been rewarded for this.
- I want to talk to you.

939
01:32:48,827 --> 01:32:52,106
- Tell me what you want!
- You see Mr. Frost...

940
01:32:52,107 --> 01:32:56,066
Daddy is disappointed.
He has a lot of money...

941
01:32:56,067 --> 01:33:00,458
- She wants to get on the show.
- I do not feel very good...

942
01:35:16,347 --> 01:35:20,506
You saw Frost when he did
how did he miss the check?

943
01:35:20,507 --> 01:35:25,058
He was so excited
for the premiere.

944
01:35:25,267 --> 01:35:28,100
Are you miles away,
in New Jersey?

945
01:35:28,387 --> 01:35:33,063
In Virzivia with cows?
In Cairo in the pyramids?

946
01:35:33,267 --> 01:35:36,259
He plunges into the pyramids,
a little to the left.

947
01:35:36,467 --> 01:35:40,301
Where you knew the chore
main with glasses.

948
01:35:41,027 --> 01:35:43,546
I want to ask you something
for Bij Giovanni.

949
01:35:43,547 --> 01:35:45,742
Let's not talk about it.

950
01:35:45,987 --> 01:35:49,024
- I want to know something...
- What thing;

951
01:35:49,467 --> 01:35:53,745
- What do they mean initially?
- Paul...

952
