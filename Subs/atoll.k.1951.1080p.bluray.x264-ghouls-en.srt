<i>Who had never dreamed of knowing heaven</i>

00:02:35,384 --> 00:02:38,491
<i>Well, here's the story about</i>

4
00:02:38,669 --> 00:02:41,105
<i>A story that starts in London at tea time,</i>

5
00:02:41,205 --> 00:02:44,483
<i>which is not surprising</i>
<i>since it's always tea time in London,</i>

00:02:44,651 --> 00:02:48,298

7
00:02:51,409 --> 00:02:53,296
Your tea, Mr. Bramwell.

8
00:02:55,590 --> 00:02:58,787
The heir from America is waiting outside.

9
00:02:58,887 --> 00:03:00,176
The heir from America?

10
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:02,523
Oh, we can't keep him waiting, eh, gentlemen?

11
00:03:02,991 --> 00:03:06,557
Well, don't stand there gaping, Pringle.
Show him in, immediately.

12
00:03:08,468 --> 00:03:10,251
Will you go in now?

13
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,033
Mr. Laurel, I presume.

14
00:03:24,133 --> 00:03:27,684
No, no, I'm Mr. Hardy.
I'm Mr. Laurel's financial exchequer.

15
00:03:27,784 --> 00:03:30,893
- But where is Mr. Laurel?
- Oh, right here. Mr. Laurel is...

16
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:34,498
Ah, Mr. Laurel.
We've had quite a time finding you.

17
00:03:36,855 --> 00:03:37,892
And now, gentlemen,

18
00:03:37,992 --> 00:03:39,788
let me introduce the two attorneys

19
00:03:39,888 --> 00:03:43,151
who handled your late uncle's affairs
in France and in Italy.

20
00:03:43,252 --> 00:03:46,236
Mr. Hardy, Monsieur Bonfois.
Mr. Laurel, Signor Paltroni.

21
00:03:46,336 --> 00:03:47,109
How do you do?

22
00:03:47,344 --> 00:03:50,542
Signor Paltroni, Mr. Hardy.
Mr. Bonfois, Mr. Laurel.

23
00:03:50,642 --> 00:03:52,076
My name is Bramwell.

24
00:03:53,023 --> 00:03:54,163
Mr. Hardy!

25
00:03:58,741 --> 00:04:02,517
Well, gentlemen,
could we get down to business?

26
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:04,414
Oh. Thank you, Stanley.

27
00:04:05,127 --> 00:04:07,057
Now, just how much is this legacy?

28
00:04:07,157 --> 00:04:10,889
Oh, you Americans, you never seem
to believe in formalities, do you?

29
00:04:12,292 --> 00:04:14,038
There's one thing about us:

30
00:04:14,172 --> 00:04:17,640
We always believe
in business before pleasure.

31
00:04:17,992 --> 00:04:19,005
You see...

32
00:04:46,967 --> 00:04:47,986
Pardon me.

33
00:04:54,501 --> 00:04:55,734
Thank you very much.

34
00:05:02,495 --> 00:05:04,347
Now, could we proceed?

35
00:05:04,447 --> 00:05:07,062
As a matter of fact we'd
better get right to business.

36
00:05:08,828 --> 00:05:11,465
Your Uncle was quite an eccentric.

37
00:05:11,565 --> 00:05:14,480
He, uh, didn't believe in banks.

38
00:05:15,633 --> 00:05:18,459
He insisted in keeping his money in cash.

39
00:05:19,888 --> 00:05:21,899
- And here it is.
- What is it?

40
00:05:22,386 --> 00:05:24,507
It's money... I think.

41
00:05:24,856 --> 00:05:28,579
Indeed, it is money, and a very large sum.

42
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:31,176
- Italian lira.
- French francs.

43
00:05:31,276 --> 00:05:32,631
And English pounds.

44
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:34,177
Stanley...

45
00:05:35,099 --> 00:05:38,394
Mr. Laurel, before we actually
turn this money over to you

46
00:05:38,494 --> 00:05:41,157
there are of course some
administrative charges.

47
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:45,913
- These include overhead legal charges...
- Deflation and motisation...

48
00:05:46,013 --> 00:05:51,256
Currency fluctuation, foreign exchange,
and a few other incidentals.

49
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:52,356
Gentlemen.

50
00:06:02,424 --> 00:06:04,170
Here's your receipt, Mr. Laurel.

51
00:06:08,060 --> 00:06:09,324
Well, gentlemen...

52
00:06:09,424 --> 00:06:12,046
My dear Mr. Hardy,
there is another small item.

53
00:06:12,487 --> 00:06:14,259
- What now?
- The taxes.

54
00:06:15,095 --> 00:06:17,731
To save you time we've
had them all figured out.

55
00:06:17,831 --> 00:06:21,223
Including, naturally,
a slight fee for our services.

56
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,547
These deductions represent income taxes,
state taxes, inheritance taxes,

57
00:06:27,647 --> 00:06:30,456
death taxes, and living taxes.

58
00:06:30,556 --> 00:06:33,721
And a few other plain taxes. Gentlemen.

59
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,951
I wish Uncle had left me the taxes.

60
00:06:49,116 --> 00:06:50,638
Is that all we get?

61
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:54,382
Oh, but you also get an island!

62
00:06:54,615 --> 00:06:55,726
An island?

63
00:06:55,826 --> 00:06:58,766
- And a beautiful yacht.
- A yacht?

64
00:06:58,866 --> 00:07:03,764
Yes, yes. The yacht is tied to a dock
right here, see, in Marseilles, France.

65
00:07:03,988 --> 00:07:06,632
And the island is here, in the south seas.

66
00:07:06,732 --> 00:07:11,330
- Gee, that sounds wonderful, Ollie!
- Well, that sounds swell. But...

67
00:07:11,871 --> 00:07:13,565
How much are the taxes on that?

68
00:07:13,665 --> 00:07:16,657
Oh, none.
The island is absolutely tax free!

69
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:19,447
- Here's your money.
- The papers for the boat.

70
00:07:19,547 --> 00:07:21,640
And this is the deed to the island.

71
00:07:21,767 --> 00:07:25,730
Well, now, that cleans out.
I mean, that cleans up the estate.

72
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:27,892
Gentlemen, I bid you a good day.

73
00:07:28,092 --> 00:07:29,399
Come, Stanley.

74
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,606
Why don't you be careful?

75
00:07:47,948 --> 00:07:50,862
Take a look.
Here's your little boat, gentlemen.

76
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:00,116
- And here's your port clearance.
- Thanks.

77
00:08:00,216 --> 00:08:01,872
We're going to need a crew for this one.

78
00:08:01,972 --> 00:08:03,872
A crew? What do we need a crew for?

79
00:08:03,972 --> 00:08:05,401
I'm running this boat!

80
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:08,415
- Well, let's get on it.
- Oh, I beg your pardon. Dock fees.

81
00:08:08,515 --> 00:08:10,094
- How much?
- 19.000.

82
00:08:10,194 --> 00:08:11,194
Here are we.

83
00:08:12,511 --> 00:08:13,542
Thank you, sir.

84
00:08:13,945 --> 00:08:15,829
- And bon voyage.
- Merci beaucoup.

85
00:08:15,929 --> 00:08:18,252
- Good day.
- Bon tomorrow! - Thank you.

86
00:08:18,352 --> 00:08:21,208
It's a good thing he didn't take the taxes.
We'd have had nothing left.

87
00:08:21,308 --> 00:08:22,288
Oh!

88
00:08:22,388 --> 00:08:26,317
Pardon me. Thanks a lot for reminding me.
I forgot about it. Thanks.

89
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:28,366
Monsieur...

90
00:08:31,679 --> 00:08:35,112
Oh, thank you. It's much too much, sir.
Much too much.

91
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:39,033
What did you have to
open your big mouth for?

92
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:40,756
I didn't know he was going to take it.

93
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,902
Come on and let's take a look at the boat.

94
00:09:28,429 --> 00:09:30,301
We've got plenty of gas!

95
00:09:36,518 --> 00:09:38,085
Let that thing alone!

96
00:09:45,938 --> 00:09:47,217
Put that down!

97
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:49,629
Look, there's a tunnel. Look.

98
00:09:51,418 --> 00:09:54,164
See? Let's go down.

99
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,156
Why don't you watch where you're walking?

100
00:10:13,256 --> 00:10:14,373
Well, I couldn't help it.

101
00:10:14,473 --> 00:10:17,205
Oh, never mind that.
Let's see what we've got here.

102
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:48,145
- I didn't know they were living underneath.
- Well, they've moved now!

103
00:10:50,779 --> 00:10:54,026
- What'd he say?
- I wouldn't care to repeat it.

104
00:10:54,256 --> 00:10:55,304
Come on!

105
00:11:16,472 --> 00:11:19,450
- What happened?
- Mind your own business!

106
00:11:23,312 --> 00:11:24,556
Oh, look!

107
00:11:26,732 --> 00:11:27,776
What is it?

108
00:11:27,876 --> 00:11:30,575
That's an emergency
life raft for four people.

109
00:11:30,751 --> 00:11:34,571
- You can't get four people into this thing!
- You don't understand...

110
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:37,291
Inside is a compressed air cylinder.

111
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:42,202
When you release the valve it builds up
large enough to carry four people.

112
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,170
Well, what about me?

113
00:11:46,703 --> 00:11:48,924
You don't have to be insulting.

114
00:11:49,993 --> 00:11:52,253
Haven't I always taken care of you?

115
00:11:53,914 --> 00:11:55,951
You're the first one I think of.

116
00:11:58,555 --> 00:12:00,913
I didn't mean to hurt your feelings, Ollie.

117
00:12:03,201 --> 00:12:04,248
Ollie.

118
00:12:06,658 --> 00:12:07,665
Ollie.

119
00:12:09,484 --> 00:12:10,791
Juhuu!

120
00:12:23,553 --> 00:12:26,827
Take that snake skin off
and get that cargo aboard!

121
00:12:28,101 --> 00:12:29,848
What about me!

122
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:31,668
What about me?!

123
00:12:54,626 --> 00:12:58,666
Don't waste time like that.
Throw them to me and I'll put them there.

124
00:14:10,907 --> 00:14:11,988
Look at that.

125
00:14:14,983 --> 00:14:17,897
- What goes on here?
- There's a man in the cage.

126
00:14:20,974 --> 00:14:24,011
- I bet it's Antoine again.
- But the guy must be mad.

127
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:26,589
- I'm a monkey, I tell you!
- He's a stateless man.

128
00:14:26,689 --> 00:14:29,237
- A what?
- Somebody who has no nationality.

129
00:14:29,337 --> 00:14:32,983
He's not a bad guy, really,
but no country seems to want him.

130
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:36,317
He'd do anything to get back on land.
Let's go, Antoine.

131
00:14:39,883 --> 00:14:42,865
Don't you know it's against the law
to land here without a passport?

132
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:47,239
Arrest me, punish me,
teach me a lesson, put me in prison,

133
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:50,882
but remember that to put me in prison
you've got to let me land.

134
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,482
- How long has he been on your ship, captain?
- Oh, months.

135
00:14:54,749 --> 00:15:00,275
He tried to get ashore at Tetrokovac,
Nagasaki, Caracas, Sydney,

136
00:15:00,404 --> 00:15:04,084
- Brooklyn.
- Brooklyn, Salonika... Everywhere we stop.

137
00:15:04,201 --> 00:15:08,463
- All I ask for is a country.
- Well, get a passport!

138
00:15:08,696 --> 00:15:10,641
Oh, that's easy to say...

139
00:15:10,741 --> 00:15:13,566
How can I get a passport
if I have no country?

140
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:16,957
And how can I get in the country
if I have no passport?

141
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:18,633
Sorry, I didn't make the regulations.

142
00:15:18,733 --> 00:15:21,089
You're not allowed to land in this country.
That's the law!

143
00:15:21,189 --> 00:15:22,662
Fine laws.

144
00:15:22,762 --> 00:15:26,080
You land monkeys without a passport
but not human beings!

145
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:29,620
Take him back on board.

146
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,200
Let's go!

147
00:15:34,309 --> 00:15:37,811
- Canned food, one crate.
- Canned food, one crate.

148
00:15:37,911 --> 00:15:39,983
- Six sheets plywood.
- Six sheets plywood.

149
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:45,826
- Six sheets plywood.
- Six sheets plywood.

150
00:15:45,926 --> 00:15:48,375
- Sugar, one sack.
- Sugar, one sack.

151
00:16:00,556 --> 00:16:02,996
- Oh... alright.
- Sugar, one sack.

152
00:16:11,894 --> 00:16:14,245
Won't you ever stop
playing hide and seek with us?

153
00:16:14,345 --> 00:16:15,794
Go on. Beat it and quick!

154
00:16:15,894 --> 00:16:17,388
But you two always stop me.

155
00:16:17,488 --> 00:16:20,277
Now, see here.
You're probably a good stonemason.

156
00:16:20,377 --> 00:16:21,823
Why don't you go and work in Italy?

157
00:16:21,923 --> 00:16:24,577
- But I'm an immigrant!
- That's just it. Immigrant in Italy.

158
00:16:24,677 --> 00:16:28,071
Are you kidding or something? How can you
immigrate to place you've left already?

159
00:16:28,171 --> 00:16:29,949
Well, maybe, but one's a sure thing:

160
00:16:30,049 --> 00:16:32,541
You're not going to leave Marseilles
without paying your passage.

161
00:16:39,848 --> 00:16:41,048
It's a funny world, huh?

162
00:16:41,261 --> 00:16:42,250
How come?

163
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:44,830
Well, here we are, catching a man
who tries to sneak off a boat

164
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:46,974
and catching another man
who tries to sneak on,

165
00:16:47,075 --> 00:16:49,178
when they could set it
so easily with one another.

166
00:16:51,687 --> 00:16:54,207
Oh, yeah, you borrowed
that without asking me.

167
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:57,714
Well, I wouldn't have mind of losing it
if your trick would finally work.

168
00:16:58,067 --> 00:16:59,529
It's tough, eh, Antoine?!

169
00:16:59,629 --> 00:17:03,080
- Oh, I'll find another way out. Don't worry.
- Don't tell me about it, huh.

170
00:17:12,159 --> 00:17:13,299
Good morning, boys.

171
00:17:13,959 --> 00:17:15,019
What'd you say?

172
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:17,978
I haven't opened my mouth.

173
00:17:18,078 --> 00:17:19,160
Good morning, boys!

174
00:17:22,186 --> 00:17:25,111
- Going on a vacation?
- We're going to the South Seas.

175
00:17:25,211 --> 00:17:26,871
Oh, it's a long trip there
and a long way back.

176
00:17:26,971 --> 00:17:28,555
Yeah, but we're not coming back.

177
00:17:28,723 --> 00:17:31,270
You see, we own an island out there.

178
00:17:31,370 --> 00:17:32,857
- Don't we, Ollie?
- Uh-huh.

179
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:37,068
- Say, how do you start an engine?
- With a mechanic, of course.

180
00:17:37,168 --> 00:17:40,217
We can't afford one.
We haven't got any money.

181
00:17:40,664 --> 00:17:43,002
We did have but they took it all for taxes.

182
00:17:43,102 --> 00:17:44,149
Well, don't worry.

183
00:17:44,249 --> 00:17:47,238
I'm gonna send you a mechanic
and he won't cost you a cent.

184
00:17:52,026 --> 00:17:53,492
Well, everything's arranged.

185
00:17:53,699 --> 00:17:55,527
What is? My execution?

186
00:17:56,078 --> 00:17:58,132
There are two characters along side.

187
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:01,590
They own an island in the South Seas.
You're invited.

188
00:18:01,869 --> 00:18:04,109
And you won't need a passport to get ashore.

189
00:18:09,993 --> 00:18:11,772
Thank you. Thank you.

190
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,899
- Bye!
- Good luck, Antoine, buddy!

191
00:18:51,355 --> 00:18:53,641
- Good morning, Stanley.
- Good morning, Ollie.

192
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:57,527
- Where are we?
- We're here. See? Right...

193
00:18:57,627 --> 00:19:00,642
Well, we shouldn't be.
We'll have to change our course.

194
00:19:04,626 --> 00:19:06,810
Keep her on the course. You can eat later.

195
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,745
- But I'm hungry.
- So am I! Selfish!

196
00:19:48,510 --> 00:19:50,358
- Your hat.
- Oh, thank you.

197
00:19:50,938 --> 00:19:53,838
Forgetting your manners
when you get over the...

198
00:19:57,484 --> 00:20:01,749
Stanley, this is wonderful.
The sea, the sky, the sun...

199
00:20:01,849 --> 00:20:04,565
And you and I alone on the bounding main.

200
00:20:04,665 --> 00:20:06,751
What do you mean, alone? He's with us.

201
00:20:06,851 --> 00:20:10,796
Oh, of course, Antoine.
He's our very, very good friend.

202
00:20:10,896 --> 00:20:11,969
Yes, sir.

203
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:15,208
- And we'll share and share alike.
- Hm.

204
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,548
Thank you.

205
00:20:17,693 --> 00:20:18,714
Thank you.

206
00:20:24,846 --> 00:20:28,818
Stanley, open the skylight
so we can get some of that good sea air.

207
00:20:34,926 --> 00:20:40,550
You know what? You need glasses.
It's already open.

208
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,311
When you get to the island
you'd better see an optimist.

209
00:20:46,637 --> 00:20:47,924
Hot rolls and butter.

210
00:20:48,097 --> 00:20:50,233
And for the peace 'de resistance'

211
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:52,661
Antoine presents his specialty

212
00:20:52,761 --> 00:20:54,144
'Le côte de veau'.

213
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,826
'Garni'.

214
00:20:57,033 --> 00:20:58,799
- Sounds good.
- Mhm.

215
00:21:00,082 --> 00:21:04,121
I'm going to enjoy that, I know.
I love côte du...

216
00:21:46,731 --> 00:21:47,895
Hey, Antoine.

217
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:51,952
I suppose in the 'garni'
you use a small touch of garlic.

218
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:53,999
Oh, I hardly use a pinch.

219
00:22:09,878 --> 00:22:15,217
A man that would steal food from a friend
is the smallest thing in the world.

220
00:22:15,420 --> 00:22:16,935
Oh, I don't know.

221
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:20,886
All I hope, Stanley,
is that you enjoyed your roll.

222
00:22:21,105 --> 00:22:23,669
How could I enjoy it, when you stole it?

223
00:22:23,769 --> 00:22:26,831
- What do you mean, I stole it? You stole it!
- Pathetic.

224
00:22:26,931 --> 00:22:30,823
I would like you to know how happy I am
to have you both as my friends.

225
00:22:30,949 --> 00:22:32,549
I would like to give you a toast.

226
00:22:33,612 --> 00:22:34,622
I give you a friendship!

227
00:22:34,769 --> 00:22:36,147
- Friendship!
- Friendship!

228
00:22:36,247 --> 00:22:37,261
Here's how!

229
00:23:07,026 --> 00:23:08,587
Lets have another, eh?

230
00:23:17,502 --> 00:23:18,574
To friendship.

231
00:23:18,701 --> 00:23:20,492
- To friendship.
- To friendship.

232
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:21,954
Here's to your health.

233
00:23:33,553 --> 00:23:34,265
Friendship...

234
00:23:34,365 --> 00:23:36,756
Friendship.
That's something really swell, no?

235
00:23:36,857 --> 00:23:38,827
No! Definitely no!

236
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:42,921
Oh! Oh, the chops are done.
Sit down, my friends.

237
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:46,275
Antoine is going to
serve you his masterpiece.

238
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,803
- What's the matter now?
- You know what's the matter.

239
00:24:30,238 --> 00:24:34,291
I want my chop! Varnished with garlic!

240
00:24:36,190 --> 00:24:38,155
You've got a lot of nerve.

241
00:24:38,255 --> 00:24:40,920
You want my chop after you've eaten yours!

242
00:24:44,935 --> 00:24:47,467
- I'm sorry.
- Well you should be!

243
00:24:51,184 --> 00:24:52,428
Just a minute!

244
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,837
Where's my potato?

245
00:24:56,585 --> 00:24:57,592
Now, listen:

246
00:24:57,771 --> 00:25:01,762
If you think I've eaten your roll and
your potato and drank your wine,

247
00:25:01,862 --> 00:25:02,840
weigh me.

248
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:05,150
Well, if you didn't, who did?

249
00:25:19,753 --> 00:25:21,622
You can't scare us with that.

250
00:25:21,722 --> 00:25:24,836
As admiral of this ship,
I'll have Stanley put you in irons!

251
00:25:25,035 --> 00:25:26,395
What's all this about?

252
00:25:27,051 --> 00:25:29,193
You stole my potato!

253
00:25:29,293 --> 00:25:32,353
Yeah! And my roll, wine, and chop!

254
00:25:34,791 --> 00:25:35,977
Incidentally...

255
00:25:36,313 --> 00:25:37,761
Who's steering the boat?

256
00:25:37,861 --> 00:25:39,513
Oh, I forgot to tell you.

257
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:42,148
I tied the wheel on it's course.

258
00:25:49,880 --> 00:25:52,863
Well, for once you have used your head.

259
00:25:52,963 --> 00:25:54,017
Thank you, Ollie.

260
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:56,274
I'll try and do that more often.

261
00:26:03,944 --> 00:26:06,410
- What was that?
- The motor's stopped.

262
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:08,797
Fix it. You're the engineer.

263
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:10,874
To tell you the truth, I'm not a mechanic.

264
00:26:10,974 --> 00:26:14,094
The captain on that boat cooked up
that story just to get rid of me.

265
00:26:14,194 --> 00:26:17,851
As usual, I'll have to do everything myself.

266
00:26:19,051 --> 00:26:20,951
Get up on deck and stand by.

267
00:26:21,078 --> 00:26:22,582
Stand by what?

268
00:26:22,735 --> 00:26:24,791
Get up the deck!

269
00:26:26,343 --> 00:26:28,729
We'll take this little matter up later!

270
00:26:38,459 --> 00:26:40,049
What do you think is wrong with it?

271
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:45,534
There's no use guessing. We'll just have
to take it apart and find out.

272
00:26:45,647 --> 00:26:47,454
In other words, use your head.

273
00:26:47,574 --> 00:26:48,585
What for?

274
00:26:49,415 --> 00:26:52,427
Well, you could use yours
for a bowling ball.

275
00:26:53,587 --> 00:26:57,634
- You mean one of those with a hole in?
- Exactly!

276
00:26:59,421 --> 00:27:00,541
Now, give me a hand.

277
00:27:04,329 --> 00:27:06,302
Now let that be a lesson to you.

278
00:27:18,931 --> 00:27:19,931
Here.

279
00:27:24,471 --> 00:27:25,485
Here.

280
00:27:33,282 --> 00:27:34,634
Put that down!

281
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:50,322
Ollie.

282
00:27:51,648 --> 00:27:52,633
What?

283
00:27:52,733 --> 00:27:54,395
The gas tank's empty.

284
00:27:56,155 --> 00:27:58,515
Why didn't you tell me that before?

285
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,760
Give me the parts and I'll
put them back together.

286
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,786
Now we've got nothing left but the sail.

287
00:28:25,923 --> 00:28:28,215
Now, when I give the signal you pull.

288
00:28:36,744 --> 00:28:39,002
What are you doing?
I could have broken my arm!

289
00:28:39,102 --> 00:28:41,374
Who are you and what
are you doing on this boat?

290
00:28:41,474 --> 00:28:42,618
You got no rights here.

291
00:28:42,718 --> 00:28:45,167
I have my rights! I'm coming as a stowaway!

292
00:28:45,267 --> 00:28:47,283
They didn't tell us a stowaway
came with the boat.

293
00:28:47,383 --> 00:28:49,036
- No.
- Listen, fellas,

294
00:28:49,136 --> 00:28:51,655
I could easily have been
a stowaway on any other boat.

295
00:28:51,755 --> 00:28:53,034
I happened to pick this one.

296
00:28:53,134 --> 00:28:55,337
Then you had to find me and spoil everything.

297
00:28:55,437 --> 00:28:58,506
We had to use the sail
because the engines broke!

298
00:28:58,629 --> 00:29:03,328
- Well, why don't you try fixing the motor?
- We tried to, but it fell in the sea. Blub.

299
00:29:03,603 --> 00:29:04,601
Fell in the sea...

300
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:08,595
Holy mackerel! Just my luck to be a stowaway
on a boat run by two land lubbers

301
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:11,758
who manage to drop the engine in the ocean!
The ocean! Aah!

302
00:29:11,858 --> 00:29:13,690
You know, I think we've offended him.

303
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,725
- What's happening? What goes on here?
- We've got a stowaway aboard.

304
00:29:16,825 --> 00:29:18,287
This is Antoine, the chef.

305
00:29:18,387 --> 00:29:19,473
Giovanni Copini.

306
00:29:19,573 --> 00:29:22,076
- Glad to meet you, sir.
- And this is Stanley.

307
00:29:22,176 --> 00:29:23,271
How do you do?

308
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:30,970
How do you do?

309
00:29:34,730 --> 00:29:36,410
Why don't you be careful?

310
00:29:36,957 --> 00:29:39,554
Come on. We can't waste all day just talking.

311
00:29:39,654 --> 00:29:42,417
Get that rope! Get the sail up! Go ahead!

312
00:29:42,517 --> 00:29:44,506
You, the fat one, get on the other side!

313
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:46,502
Pull! It takes muscle to raise a sail!

314
00:29:46,602 --> 00:29:48,778
The fat one, the other side!
All together now!

315
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,274
Come on, pull on that!

316
00:30:33,845 --> 00:30:36,612
- Just in time to eat lunch.
- Never mind eating.

317
00:30:36,932 --> 00:30:38,625
What happened to my pants?

318
00:30:39,077 --> 00:30:42,238
I put them right there to dry.
The cannot disappear...

319
00:30:42,842 --> 00:30:44,383
Hey, the boat's moving!

320
00:30:46,802 --> 00:30:47,829
You get...

321
00:30:59,331 --> 00:31:02,086
- Kinda nice, eh, Stanley?
- Sure is.

322
00:31:02,594 --> 00:31:04,961
Just like playing hooky from school.

323
00:31:05,434 --> 00:31:07,368
We're all playing hooky more or less.

324
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:10,797
Giovanni, what are you playing hooky from?

325
00:31:11,265 --> 00:31:15,117
From a world where I'm always being told
what to do and then how to do it.

326
00:31:15,411 --> 00:31:19,004
One day a rich real estate man in my village
hired me to build a wall.

327
00:31:19,398 --> 00:31:23,964
I spent weeks trying to find bricks with the
right shape and kind of color he wanted.

328
00:31:24,137 --> 00:31:26,471
I fitted them in the place one by one

329
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:28,417
as if they were jewels.

330
00:31:29,197 --> 00:31:33,113
When the wall was finished it was shining
in the sun like a real work of art

331
00:31:33,213 --> 00:31:36,252
because it was me, Giovanni,
the best mason money can buy.

332
00:31:37,491 --> 00:31:39,091
Then the man came to have a look.

333
00:31:39,724 --> 00:31:41,518
And he ordered me to tear down the wall.

334
00:31:41,624 --> 00:31:44,070
He suddenly changed his mind.
He wanted a picket fence.

335
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:47,027
That's when I decided to play hooky.

336
00:31:47,127 --> 00:31:48,810
We don't blame you.

337
00:31:48,925 --> 00:31:51,288
- And you, what are you playing hooky from?
- Taxes!

338
00:31:51,388 --> 00:31:53,805
Yeah. We don't like taxes.

339
00:31:55,437 --> 00:31:58,790
Hey, Antoine. What about you?
Where is your home?

340
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:00,030
My home?

341
00:32:01,043 --> 00:32:02,078
I don't know.

342
00:32:02,301 --> 00:32:04,396
The whole world ought to be man's country.

343
00:32:04,904 --> 00:32:05,943
But for me...

344
00:32:06,456 --> 00:32:09,136
someone seems to have locked all the doors.

345
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,079
I can just see our island now.

346
00:32:14,103 --> 00:32:16,576
Palm trees, flowers,

347
00:32:17,201 --> 00:32:21,128
the sun to warm us, and the gentle rain.

348
00:32:32,131 --> 00:32:34,582
It's a storm! Don't you think
we'd better get the boat ready?

349
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:36,662
Yes, it looks like a bad one.

350
00:32:36,762 --> 00:32:39,227
- I never saw one like this before.
- Me either!

351
00:32:39,674 --> 00:32:43,364
- We'd better pull down the sail.
- I'll go get the life raft.

352
00:33:13,962 --> 00:33:15,163
Pull down the sail!

353
00:35:43,863 --> 00:35:45,416
Help!

354
00:35:58,176 --> 00:36:01,002
Help! Help!

355
00:36:01,882 --> 00:36:02,909
He...

356
00:37:22,947 --> 00:37:24,894
Ah, look at that!

357
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:29,971
- An island!
- We're on an island!

358
00:37:30,071 --> 00:37:31,626
Stanley, we're on an...

359
00:37:42,798 --> 00:37:44,817
We're on an island! Take a peep!

360
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:47,522
Take a peep!

361
00:37:47,793 --> 00:37:49,592
I'm too popped to peep.

362
00:37:51,615 --> 00:37:52,708
Oh!

363
00:37:53,349 --> 00:37:55,429
Oh, look. Look.

364
00:37:56,062 --> 00:37:58,016
Oh, boy!

365
00:37:59,492 --> 00:38:02,806
It's an atoll! That's what it is! An atoll!

366
00:38:02,906 --> 00:38:03,906
Come on!

367
00:38:04,052 --> 00:38:07,612
- Take care, brother. Easy, easy. Easy, easy.
- Yeah. Yeah.

368
00:38:07,825 --> 00:38:09,270
It's alright! It's alright!

369
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:10,668
Let's go fishing now, eh?

370
00:38:10,789 --> 00:38:12,775
- Hand me a basket.
- Right away.

371
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:16,988
Quick! A pot, some wood.
Build a fire for the bouillabaisse.

372
00:38:17,148 --> 00:38:18,888
Don't forget to put some garlic in it.

373
00:38:18,988 --> 00:38:21,784
Oh, without it,
it wouldn't be a real bouillabaisse.

374
00:38:59,635 --> 00:39:02,981
- Well, it don't look so bad.
- Still in good condition.

375
00:39:22,091 --> 00:39:24,942
Antoine, what time are you serving dinner?

376
00:39:25,042 --> 00:39:27,478
If you want to eat,
you'd better go build a fire.

377
00:39:27,578 --> 00:39:29,414
And you, my boy, clean the fish.

378
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:33,661
You get the paper and I'll get the wood.

379
00:39:39,089 --> 00:39:40,529
- Ollie!
- Yeah?

380
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:42,762
- Hold this a minute, will ya?
- Okay.

381
00:39:55,146 --> 00:39:58,245
You know, boys, there seems to be
a lot of room for building houses here.

382
00:39:58,613 --> 00:40:01,017
Yeah, it sure is naked around here.

383
00:40:01,117 --> 00:40:03,759
Admiral, what do we do on a deserted island?

384
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,862
Here's a man that was shipwrecked
and he did alright. Listen.

385
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:11,827
"Robinson Crusoe
was born in the city of York.

386
00:40:12,097 --> 00:40:14,560
"His father wanted him to become a lawyer,

387
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:17,295
but young Crusoe longed to go to sea."

388
00:40:26,847 --> 00:40:30,633
<i>Our modern Robinson Crusoes</i>
<i>have gotten used to their new life.</i>

389
00:40:31,487 --> 00:40:36,140
<i>By using the latest scientific farming</i>
<i>methods they have tamed the wild land.</i>

390
00:40:42,299 --> 00:40:46,189
<i>And Mother Nature has supplied them</i>
<i>with plenty of fresh water.</i>

391
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,984
<i>Man has set to work, so has nature.</i>

392
00:41:04,084 --> 00:41:07,913
<i>She has quickly changed the burned rock</i>
<i>into an enchanting paradise.</i>

393
00:41:08,246 --> 00:41:11,220
<i>Weeks, months, years have passed.</i>

394
00:41:11,526 --> 00:41:13,233
<i>Everything is now improved.</i>

395
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:15,977
<i>At last our castaways</i>
<i>have earned the right</i>

396
00:41:16,077 --> 00:41:18,644
<i>to take a little time off</i>
<i>from their hard work.</i>

397
00:41:27,418 --> 00:41:28,578
Oscar.

398
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,265
Oscar!

399
00:41:52,264 --> 00:41:56,899
<i>For the animals as well as for the men</i>
<i>this island has become a real paradise.</i>

400
00:41:57,098 --> 00:42:02,531
<i>Yes, but a Garden of Eden</i>
<i>without Eve and Adam is bored.</i>

401
00:42:02,925 --> 00:42:04,785
<i>But... But what's this?</i>

402
00:42:04,991 --> 00:42:07,439
<i>Where are these</i>
<i>skipping stones leading us to?</i>

403
00:42:07,539 --> 00:42:10,071
<i>To Papeete, the capital of Tahiti.</i>

404
00:42:10,218 --> 00:42:12,239
<i>And who do we find? Eve!</i>

405
00:42:12,339 --> 00:42:14,831
<i>I beg your pardon... Chérie Lamour.</i>

406
00:42:14,961 --> 00:42:17,816
<i>As you can see she's got plenty of brains</i>

407
00:42:17,916 --> 00:42:19,267
<i>and culture.</i>

408
00:42:19,547 --> 00:42:21,918
<i>The most glamorous girl in Tahiti,</i>

409
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:24,481
<i>and born in Paris, of course.</i>

410
00:42:24,707 --> 00:42:26,227
<i>Today is her big day.</i>

411
00:42:26,327 --> 00:42:31,107
<i>First of all she is taking an audition at the</i>
<i>Cockatoo, the smartest night club in town.</i>

412
00:42:31,591 --> 00:42:35,531
<i>And also she is expected at the courthouse</i>
<i>for an important occasion.</i>

413
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:38,671
<i>She's going to marry Lieutenant Jack Frazer.</i>

414
00:42:46,839 --> 00:42:47,945
What time is it?

415
00:42:49,199 --> 00:42:50,879
Play us the song.

416
00:45:02,226 --> 00:45:03,246
Thank you.

417
00:45:06,598 --> 00:45:10,322
- Can't you stand and have a drink on that?
- Oh, no, no, no. I'm late to be far away.

418
00:45:10,422 --> 00:45:13,152
Thank you. Good bye. Thank you, goodbye.

419
00:45:14,380 --> 00:45:17,620
Ah, Miss Lamour, this way, please.

420
00:45:20,602 --> 00:45:22,507
Oh, sweetheart, I'm so pleased.

421
00:45:22,607 --> 00:45:24,467
It hardly looks like it.
You're three quarters of an hour late!

422
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:27,604
You're not going to grumble
about three little quarters of an hour?

423
00:45:27,704 --> 00:45:30,024
Your Honor,
I didn't keep you waiting, I hope.

424
00:45:30,224 --> 00:45:32,444
- Well, it...
- Ah, ah.. cherie.

425
00:45:34,397 --> 00:45:38,654
Ow, Your Honor, look at them.
Aren't they lovely?

426
00:45:38,754 --> 00:45:43,123
- But you've so extravagant, my dear.
- Miss Lamour, and you, sir...

427
00:45:43,389 --> 00:45:45,659
Marriage is a most important thing,

428
00:45:45,759 --> 00:45:47,943
and I should like before
proceeding any further...

429
00:45:48,043 --> 00:45:50,159
- I got my contract.
- What contract?

430
00:45:50,259 --> 00:45:52,602
When we're married we're going
to share everything in common.

431
00:45:52,702 --> 00:45:54,011
That's not what I'm talking about.

432
00:45:54,111 --> 00:45:57,033
My contract with the Cockatoo!
My debut's tomorrow night.

433
00:45:57,133 --> 00:45:59,356
So you'll be able to come
and see me before you sail.

434
00:45:59,456 --> 00:46:01,098
Miss Lamour, if you please. Won't you...

435
00:46:01,198 --> 00:46:03,983
Oh, but I'm listening to you, Your Honour.

436
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:08,526
Miss Lamour, Lieutenant, marriage
is a most important thing.

437
00:46:08,626 --> 00:46:09,626
Just a minute.

438
00:46:10,395 --> 00:46:12,233
I'm sorry to interrupt you, Your Honor,

439
00:46:12,333 --> 00:46:14,284
but I've something to
straighten out with my fiance.

440
00:46:14,384 --> 00:46:16,314
It's most unusual but if...

441
00:46:16,415 --> 00:46:20,031
Am I to understand that you intend
to continue your career after we are married?

442
00:46:20,131 --> 00:46:21,971
But of course, my sweetheart.

443
00:46:22,071 --> 00:46:23,909
You never suggested that I should give it up.

444
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:25,329
I never broached the subject

445
00:46:25,429 --> 00:46:27,617
because I took it for granted
that after we're married

446
00:46:27,717 --> 00:46:29,423
you'd devote yourself entirely to me.

447
00:46:29,524 --> 00:46:32,240
Nothing could please me more
if you were here all the time,

448
00:46:32,340 --> 00:46:35,192
but when you spend ten months
out of the year sailing the seas.

449
00:46:35,406 --> 00:46:36,769
what would you expect me to do?

450
00:46:36,869 --> 00:46:38,436
Swim behind your little barge?

451
00:46:38,536 --> 00:46:39,548
Well, look, honey.

452
00:46:39,821 --> 00:46:41,481
I'm not going to tolerate

453
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:44,025
that while I'm out at sea
you spend your nights

454
00:46:44,125 --> 00:46:46,506
play 'Come on, girl'
in some clip joint.

455
00:46:46,606 --> 00:46:47,788
Ah!

456
00:46:47,888 --> 00:46:49,842
'Come on, girl' in some clip joint?!

457
00:46:49,942 --> 00:46:52,948
What do you think I am?
I'm an actress, not a bum.

458
00:46:53,048 --> 00:46:54,490
You know what people call me?

459
00:46:54,590 --> 00:46:58,773
The female Caruso. That's a fact, Your Honor.
The female Caruso.

460
00:47:02,865 --> 00:47:06,292
- Calm yourself, Miss Lamour.
- I'm very calm, Your Honour!

461
00:47:06,392 --> 00:47:08,591
But I'm not going to submit
to this kind of blackmail!

462
00:47:08,691 --> 00:47:10,608
In that case I'm not going
to hang around here.

463
00:47:11,116 --> 00:47:13,444
You think about it, but think fast.

464
00:47:13,815 --> 00:47:14,945
Please, sir...

465
00:47:15,045 --> 00:47:18,205
Let him go away, Your Honour.
I won't run after him. Do you hear me?

466
00:47:18,305 --> 00:47:19,319
Miss Lamour...

467
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:22,802
Think about it as well and come ang give me
your answer tomorrow night at the Cockatoo.

468
00:47:22,902 --> 00:47:25,499
If you're not in the audience
I know what your answer is. Jack?

469
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:26,639
Sweetheart.

470
00:47:28,633 --> 00:47:30,173
He will come, won't he?

471
00:47:30,786 --> 00:47:33,006
Tell him, if he doesn't
show up tomorrow night

472
00:47:33,426 --> 00:47:34,939
he'll never see me again.

473
00:47:35,413 --> 00:47:37,019
I don't know what I'll do, yet,

474
00:47:37,553 --> 00:47:39,701
but I'll see to it he never finds me.

475
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:43,752
Okay, I'll give him the message,
but you know him better than I do.

476
00:47:44,519 --> 00:47:47,112
Well, then he'll show up, I'm sure.

477
00:50:19,150 --> 00:50:21,937
Magnificent. And to think
that dickhead didn't show up.

478
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:44,577
He didn't show up! He didn't show up!
He ruined everything!

479
00:50:45,418 --> 00:50:47,404
- Where is he?
- He sailed this morning.

480
00:50:47,957 --> 00:50:50,244
I won't even listen,
he said he wouldn't give in.

481
00:50:50,344 --> 00:50:51,623
I wouldn't give in, either.

482
00:50:52,951 --> 00:50:55,331
Did you tell him he might lose me forever?

483
00:50:56,390 --> 00:50:57,382
I did.

484
00:50:57,482 --> 00:50:59,164
Encore. Encore!

485
00:51:04,683 --> 00:51:07,233
- They want an encore. Hurry up!
- Yes, yes.

486
00:51:07,333 --> 00:51:09,557
But Jack will be back in two weeks.
You'll see him again.

487
00:51:09,657 --> 00:51:11,465
- What do I care. I won't be here.
- What?

488
00:51:11,565 --> 00:51:14,438
- When is your ship sailing, captain?
- Next Friday. Why?

489
00:51:14,745 --> 00:51:16,062
Take me as a passenger.

490
00:51:16,162 --> 00:51:18,342
But my tub's no luxury liner,
you understand?

491
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:20,605
It makes no difference.
All I want is to leave!

492
00:51:20,705 --> 00:51:23,054
Hey! There's also my wife!

493
00:52:05,673 --> 00:52:08,259
Oh, is the hunting season on?

494
00:52:08,432 --> 00:52:09,977
Get up! Out of that bed!

495
00:52:10,077 --> 00:52:12,445
Your husband should've warned me
that you're coming on this voyage.

496
00:52:12,545 --> 00:52:14,377
I wouldn't have sailed on this slave ship.

497
00:52:14,477 --> 00:52:17,342
I never believed that story of your
american friend being home.

498
00:52:17,523 --> 00:52:19,956
I had a hunch you're going
to pay for my husband.

499
00:52:20,642 --> 00:52:21,656
Get up.

500
00:52:22,012 --> 00:52:24,685
- And start your packing.
- You're going to throw me over board?

501
00:52:24,785 --> 00:52:25,785
No.

502
00:52:26,072 --> 00:52:28,012
We're going to land you on an island.

503
00:52:28,172 --> 00:52:29,425
An island...

504
00:52:29,918 --> 00:52:31,891
- unknown.
- Are there people on it?

505
00:52:32,184 --> 00:52:34,284
You'll find out about
that as soon as you land.

506
00:52:34,478 --> 00:52:37,151
Wherever you appear,
in no time you're surrounded by men.

507
00:52:42,373 --> 00:52:45,208
No! I tell you it isn't fair to poor girl off
in a deserted island.

508
00:52:45,308 --> 00:52:46,886
There're husbands right for her.

509
00:52:47,013 --> 00:52:48,904
Where are husbands, there are people.

510
00:52:49,004 --> 00:52:50,505
- It suits.
- Get moving.

511
00:52:50,605 --> 00:52:52,448
But I keep telling you
she only came aboard

512
00:52:52,548 --> 00:52:55,095
on account of Frazer,
just to make him jealous.

513
00:52:55,196 --> 00:52:57,557
He'll blow his top if I tell him
that I put off on an island.

514
00:52:57,657 --> 00:52:59,441
You don't have to tell him about this.

515
00:53:00,535 --> 00:53:01,774
On the other hand...

516
00:53:02,275 --> 00:53:04,921
Tell him I can be just as stubborn as he can.

517
00:53:07,388 --> 00:53:09,115
- I row you over.
- No, you don't.

518
00:53:09,441 --> 00:53:10,581
You stay right here.

519
00:53:11,015 --> 00:53:13,415
She knows how to row. And if she can't...

520
00:53:13,573 --> 00:53:14,561
she'll have to swim.

521
00:53:14,661 --> 00:53:17,261
- So long, sweetheart.
- Oh, no!

522
00:53:22,288 --> 00:53:24,504
I'm glad you boys are here.
I wanna talk to you.

523
00:53:24,604 --> 00:53:26,686
Where were you fellas a while ago?

524
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:29,452
I was down at the beach
getting these fish for dinner. See?

525
00:53:29,552 --> 00:53:31,135
I was working in the garden.

526
00:53:31,961 --> 00:53:34,163
Did you see or hear anything?

527
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:36,245
- Just the waves.
- Why?

528
00:53:36,345 --> 00:53:37,689
I'll tell you why.

529
00:53:37,789 --> 00:53:39,745
Because I was down by the lagoon,

530
00:53:39,845 --> 00:53:42,513
and I thought I heard
the engines of a big boat.

531
00:53:42,685 --> 00:53:43,757
Then it whistled.

532
00:53:43,884 --> 00:53:46,098
By the time I climbed up to see...

533
00:53:46,704 --> 00:53:49,559
- there was nothing there.
- That's because it had gone.

534
00:53:49,810 --> 00:53:50,830
- Ah.
- Ah.

535
00:53:51,944 --> 00:53:53,037
What had gone?

536
00:53:53,237 --> 00:53:54,291
The boat.

537
00:53:59,128 --> 00:54:02,561
You mean to tell me that you saw a boat
and didn't let us know?

538
00:54:02,921 --> 00:54:05,097
Well, I saw it, and I waved to it,

539
00:54:05,197 --> 00:54:06,881
but it didn't wave back, so I...

540
00:54:07,413 --> 00:54:10,466
Get us something to drink
before I forget myself.

541
00:54:13,980 --> 00:54:16,870
Stan has certainly received more
than his share of stupidity.

542
00:54:16,970 --> 00:54:20,406
Yeah, no one person could be
really such a blockhead.

543
00:54:23,437 --> 00:54:24,526
Pardon me.

544
00:54:37,038 --> 00:54:38,571
What's the matter with you?

545
00:54:38,931 --> 00:54:40,764
I think I saw something.

546
00:54:41,054 --> 00:54:42,624
What are you talking about?

547
00:54:43,257 --> 00:54:45,187
There's a girl in the kitchen.

548
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,065
You are absolutely right.

549
00:54:49,865 --> 00:54:51,225
There she is!

550
00:54:51,966 --> 00:54:53,015
Hello.

551
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:03,587
Well...

552
00:55:03,753 --> 00:55:04,955
Hello, fellas.

553
00:55:05,480 --> 00:55:07,836
- How... How did you get here?
- Well...

554
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:09,525
I guess you might say

555
00:55:09,772 --> 00:55:13,036
- I was dropped by a witch.
- Like one that rides on a broom?

556
00:55:13,136 --> 00:55:14,361
Oh, no.

557
00:55:14,741 --> 00:55:16,514
This one used a shotgun.

558
00:55:16,707 --> 00:55:20,381
I'm sorry for this intrusion, but you'll
have to take me as a guest, I'm afraid.

559
00:55:20,481 --> 00:55:21,967
It will be a pleasure.

560
00:55:22,164 --> 00:55:24,567
I knew I should've built
a guest house a long time ago.

561
00:55:24,667 --> 00:55:25,346
Oh...

562
00:55:25,953 --> 00:55:27,487
There's no place for me to stay?

563
00:55:27,587 --> 00:55:30,161
Don't you worry your
pretty little head about that.

564
00:55:30,262 --> 00:55:33,233
Giovanni and Antoine will
move in with Stanley and me.

565
00:55:33,459 --> 00:55:36,393
- And you can stay right here.
- You're very kind.

566
00:55:36,493 --> 00:55:39,212
Come, my little princess,
and I shall show you to your boudoir.

567
00:55:39,579 --> 00:55:41,965
You know, I think I'm
going to like this place.

568
00:55:42,338 --> 00:55:45,444
It's swell. You don't have
to shave or anything.

569
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:56,239
I left my cases down
at the beach with all my things.

570
00:55:57,383 --> 00:56:00,443
Gentlemen, get the lady's luggage
and bring it to her chateau.

571
00:56:00,813 --> 00:56:01,836
Thank you.

572
00:56:03,059 --> 00:56:04,309
What's that funny thing up there?

573
00:56:04,409 --> 00:56:07,177
That, my dear, is the wreckage
of the good ship Momus.

574
00:56:07,513 --> 00:56:10,766
I shall never forget the day
that I found this island.

575
00:56:10,866 --> 00:56:14,134
It was a terrible night, dark as pitch.

576
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:17,523
It was so pitch, you couldn't see
your hand behind your back.

577
00:56:17,623 --> 00:56:19,302
Exactly, Stanley.

578
00:56:19,707 --> 00:56:22,906
Then, all of a sudden I spotted that harbour.

579
00:56:23,451 --> 00:56:26,374
I put her bow into the teeth of the gale,

580
00:56:26,519 --> 00:56:31,292
lashed myself to the wheel
and beached her on that pinnacle.

581
00:56:31,443 --> 00:56:33,663
And it's been there ever since.

582
00:56:33,982 --> 00:56:36,921
Well, boys, you must have had
trouble getting it up so high.

583
00:56:37,021 --> 00:56:38,267
He read it in a book.

584
00:56:38,367 --> 00:56:40,766
Uh, come, my dear. Book...

585
00:56:42,116 --> 00:56:44,735
One, two, three... All there. Thank you.

586
00:57:37,969 --> 00:57:41,074
Stanley, have you forgotten
that we have company?

587
00:57:46,999 --> 00:57:49,239
Gentlemen, make yourselves comfortable.

588
00:57:58,328 --> 00:57:59,400
Gentlemen...

589
00:58:27,112 --> 00:58:28,120
Stanley...

590
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:29,228
Yes?

591
00:58:29,328 --> 00:58:30,580
This is my side.

592
00:58:30,940 --> 00:58:33,173
Well, there's no room on my side.

593
00:58:33,434 --> 00:58:36,400
Well, the fair thing to do is to take turns.

594
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:42,021
While one sits up, the other sleeps
and when he wakes up, we change.

595
00:58:42,663 --> 00:58:45,170
Now, that's what I call a sport.

596
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:47,012
Thank you, Ollie.

597
00:58:47,625 --> 00:58:49,232
That's a good idea.

598
00:58:49,378 --> 00:58:53,772
I sleep and then when
you wake up, I sleep again.

599
00:58:54,562 --> 00:58:56,643
Haven't you forgotten something?

600
00:58:57,876 --> 00:58:58,864
Huh?

601
00:58:58,964 --> 00:59:00,769
Haven't you forgotten something?

602
00:59:02,481 --> 00:59:04,213
Oh... Good night, Ollie.

603
00:59:04,313 --> 00:59:07,467
- I'm sorry, Ollie.
- Get up and put that candle out.

604
00:59:07,567 --> 00:59:10,696
- But you said that I could...
- Go ahead, selfish.

605
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:26,749
Ollie.

606
00:59:28,421 --> 00:59:29,434
Ollie.

607
00:59:31,091 --> 00:59:32,094
Ollie.

608
00:59:33,107 --> 00:59:34,387
Are you awake yet?

609
00:59:34,807 --> 00:59:35,847
No!

610
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:08,847
Pardon me.

611
01:01:29,437 --> 01:01:31,995
- What is that thing?
- Look out!

612
01:01:47,142 --> 01:01:49,330
Open the window and we'll drive him out.

613
01:02:17,726 --> 01:02:19,915
This morning I'm going
to prepare a magnificent

614
01:02:20,015 --> 01:02:22,136
seagull egg omelette
with fine herbs.

615
01:02:22,237 --> 01:02:23,662
Omelette. Bah!

616
01:02:23,766 --> 01:02:27,700
Well, today I'm going to draw the plans
for a splendid villa with a big roman bath.

617
01:02:27,800 --> 01:02:28,959
What are you going to do, Ollie?

618
01:02:29,059 --> 01:02:31,945
I'm going to give you fellas
a piece of my mind.

619
01:02:32,046 --> 01:02:33,999
Chérie's a nice girl, isn't she?

620
01:02:34,099 --> 01:02:35,442
- Exquisite.
- Charming!

621
01:02:35,542 --> 01:02:37,992
- Pretty, too.
- And we're all friends, aren't we?

622
01:02:38,092 --> 01:02:39,405
- Of course.
- Naturally.

623
01:02:39,505 --> 01:02:43,321
Well, I make a motion that we never let
a woman come between us. Agreed?

624
01:02:43,421 --> 01:02:44,884
- Of course.
- I agree.

625
01:02:45,042 --> 01:02:46,493
Now, let's all get dressed.

626
01:02:49,718 --> 01:02:53,218
- Say, Ollie, where's the sandpaper?
- Sandpaper?

627
01:02:54,372 --> 01:02:56,098
- In that locker.
- Thank you.

628
01:03:12,286 --> 01:03:13,286
Pardon me.

629
01:03:14,890 --> 01:03:15,892
Thank you.

630
01:03:17,095 --> 01:03:18,108
Pardon me.

631
01:03:19,538 --> 01:03:20,581
Thank you.

632
01:03:25,937 --> 01:03:26,954
Pardon me.

633
01:03:31,457 --> 01:03:32,483
Thanks a lot.

634
01:03:33,531 --> 01:03:34,576
Pardon me.

635
01:03:38,822 --> 01:03:39,835
Thank you.

636
01:03:42,118 --> 01:03:43,135
Pardon me.

637
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,049
Hey!

638
01:04:25,953 --> 01:04:26,963
Look!

639
01:04:38,317 --> 01:04:39,372
Hello.

640
01:04:42,763 --> 01:04:43,872
What's the matter?

641
01:04:44,268 --> 01:04:45,712
The cat got your tongues?

642
01:04:48,201 --> 01:04:50,134
How nice you look this morning.

643
01:04:52,423 --> 01:04:54,368
Come on, come on. I want you to sit down.

644
01:04:58,226 --> 01:05:00,759
I'll have the food
on the table in two seconds.

645
01:05:16,389 --> 01:05:19,029
- Look! She's done clean plates!
- Even a table cloth!

646
01:05:19,129 --> 01:05:20,425
And clean napkins!

647
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:23,101
- She even swept the floor.
- Yes.

648
01:05:38,497 --> 01:05:40,457
Does this belong to anybody?

649
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:44,083
- Never saw that guy before.
- Nobody I know. - No.

650
01:05:49,073 --> 01:05:50,097
It's mine.

651
01:05:50,993 --> 01:05:52,144
It's a friend.

652
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:55,563
It's just someone I knew once.

653
01:06:09,307 --> 01:06:11,900
I have a little surprise
which I hope you're going to like.

654
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:13,174
What, another one?

655
01:06:13,653 --> 01:06:14,729
What is it?

656
01:06:15,078 --> 01:06:16,331
A bouillabaisse.

657
01:06:18,499 --> 01:06:21,691
Tell me, was your boyfriend
fond of bouillabaisse?

658
01:06:22,005 --> 01:06:23,191
Oh, he loved it.

659
01:07:13,384 --> 01:07:15,762
Is this the warehouse you've been building?

660
01:07:15,862 --> 01:07:18,697
As warehouses go, it's a funny warehouse.

661
01:07:23,492 --> 01:07:25,305
This is no warehouse!

662
01:07:45,393 --> 01:07:46,612
It's for you.

663
01:07:47,739 --> 01:07:51,239
- For me?
- Yes, for you. It sure is easy to fool you.

664
01:07:51,545 --> 01:07:54,094
Did you really think we
were building a refrigerator?

665
01:07:54,194 --> 01:07:58,347
We were afraid you'd find out,
so we put on all the decorations last night.

666
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:23,887
Come on in.

667
01:08:57,805 --> 01:08:59,058
It's just lovely.

668
01:09:04,241 --> 01:09:08,121
You've all been such wonderful friends.
This is the first real home I've ever had.

669
01:09:08,321 --> 01:09:10,001
I'm so happy I...

670
01:09:12,340 --> 01:09:14,321
You're not content just to be a singer.

671
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,660
You've also got to be the comedian.

672
01:09:26,413 --> 01:09:27,759
What are you playing now?

673
01:09:27,973 --> 01:09:30,122
Snow white and the seven dwarves?

674
01:09:33,139 --> 01:09:36,599
That's the fella in the picture
that she carries around with her.

675
01:09:37,952 --> 01:09:41,600
Alright! You've tracked me down! Now what?

676
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:44,100
You're wrong, baby.
I never tried tracking you down.

677
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:47,523
Our old friend Dolan reported
he'd seen an uncharted island.

678
01:09:47,825 --> 01:09:49,353
My business here is to chart it.

679
01:09:49,453 --> 01:09:51,420
My men are out there working at it now.

680
01:09:52,778 --> 01:09:53,811
Look here...

681
01:09:54,124 --> 01:09:56,197
I suppose I had to have my head examined

682
01:09:56,297 --> 01:09:58,220
but I'm going to give you one more chance.

683
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:03,417
Go and pack you're things
and be down at the beach in 15 minutes.

684
01:10:05,086 --> 01:10:06,154
What for?

685
01:10:06,254 --> 01:10:08,361
Well, I suppose you want
to be rescued, don't you?

686
01:10:09,378 --> 01:10:10,492
Not by you!

687
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:15,602
Lieutenant! Come right away!
We've found something!

688
01:10:15,834 --> 01:10:17,278
OK. I'll be right with you.

689
01:10:19,663 --> 01:10:20,863
This is your last chance.

690
01:10:21,375 --> 01:10:22,450
Are you coming?

691
01:10:23,863 --> 01:10:24,889
No!

692
01:10:33,327 --> 01:10:34,971
We'd better keep an eye on that guy.

693
01:10:35,071 --> 01:10:37,327
He looks like a man
who would steal our island.

694
01:10:53,150 --> 01:10:55,725
It's uranium! The place is loaded with it.

695
01:10:56,787 --> 01:10:57,860
Uranium.

696
01:11:02,503 --> 01:11:05,034
Which one of you fellas happened
to land first on this island?

697
01:11:05,134 --> 01:11:06,850
Let me handle this, fellas.

698
01:11:07,062 --> 01:11:08,310
Why do you ask that?

699
01:11:08,410 --> 01:11:10,855
Because it will determine
which nation owns the island.

700
01:11:11,197 --> 01:11:12,833
We all own it.

701
01:11:12,933 --> 01:11:15,172
Of course, of course, you own the island.

702
01:11:15,272 --> 01:11:19,908
You're the real proprietors but
some country has got to claim sovereignty.

703
01:11:20,085 --> 01:11:23,636
International law specifies that
an island belongs to the country

704
01:11:23,736 --> 01:11:26,012
whose citizen was first to set foot on it.

705
01:11:26,113 --> 01:11:28,726
- So some country can take our island?
- That's right.

706
01:11:29,072 --> 01:11:31,524
And if that country has immigration laws?

707
01:11:31,624 --> 01:11:34,951
- You'll have to abide by those laws.
- Even income tax laws?

708
01:11:35,051 --> 01:11:38,860
Income tax laws,
inheritance taxes and sales taxes.

709
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:42,225
You know what they're trying to do?
They're trying to take our geraniums.

710
01:11:42,325 --> 01:11:43,784
That's it, exactly!

711
01:11:43,918 --> 01:11:46,651
Pardon us for just one moment.

712
01:11:56,950 --> 01:12:00,914
Let's tell him that we all landed
on the island at the same time.

713
01:12:01,014 --> 01:12:04,914
We can't tell a lie.
Antoine was the first to land.

714
01:12:05,091 --> 01:12:08,271
- It was a terrible night and...
- Alright, alright.

715
01:12:14,508 --> 01:12:15,530
Here's how it is.

716
01:12:15,630 --> 01:12:17,873
I was the first man
to set foot on this island.

717
01:12:17,973 --> 01:12:20,640
- OK. What's your name?
- Antoine.

718
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:24,357
- Antoine what?
- Antoine Master of Cooking.

719
01:12:24,712 --> 01:12:26,897
- Nationality?
- I haven't any.

720
01:12:27,107 --> 01:12:30,234
You see, he is what is
known as a stateless man.

721
01:12:30,334 --> 01:12:33,221
Or in other words, a misplaced person.

722
01:12:33,321 --> 01:12:36,173
You see, he's lost
and he can't find himself.

723
01:12:36,443 --> 01:12:38,771
- Listen, you've got to have a nationality.
- Telling me?

724
01:12:38,871 --> 01:12:41,438
I explained that in every port
wherever I tried to land,

725
01:12:41,538 --> 01:12:43,776
but no country wanted to have me.

726
01:12:43,877 --> 01:12:46,149
Every country now will want to have you.

727
01:12:47,039 --> 01:12:50,213
I'll go and radio the authorities
and dump it in somebody's lap.

728
01:12:50,313 --> 01:12:51,371
So long, gentlemen.

729
01:12:51,583 --> 01:12:53,465
- Bye, bye.
- So long, Lieutenant.

730
01:13:00,522 --> 01:13:02,375
You can call the gentlemen of the press.

731
01:13:08,519 --> 01:13:10,089
Is it true a new island's been discovered?

732
01:13:10,189 --> 01:13:12,188
- Can you give us the facts?
- Who does it belong to?

733
01:13:12,288 --> 01:13:14,891
Not so fast, gentlemen, not so fast.

734
01:13:15,407 --> 01:13:16,979
The island belongs to no one,

735
01:13:17,079 --> 01:13:18,467
- for the time being.
- To no one?

736
01:13:18,567 --> 01:13:20,586
Four shipwrecked men
have settled down there,

737
01:13:20,686 --> 01:13:24,222
but the first man who stepped down
the island is a stateless person,

738
01:13:24,323 --> 01:13:26,564
a citizen of no nationality.

739
01:13:27,156 --> 01:13:30,927
Consequently no country is an a position
to lay claim to sovereignty on the island.

740
01:13:31,027 --> 01:13:33,165
- Is it an important island?
- Important?

741
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,730
It is loaded with the biggest deposits
of uranium discovered to this day.

742
01:13:36,830 --> 01:13:39,579
- Uranium?
- Uranium?

743
01:13:39,742 --> 01:13:41,342
Here's the complete file, gentlemen.

744
01:13:41,448 --> 01:13:42,982
You can go through it as you please.

745
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:51,769
Every hour on the hour this station
is giving you up to the minute reports...

746
01:13:51,869 --> 01:13:54,968
- about difficults...
- of the great states...

747
01:13:55,068 --> 01:13:56,772
in the metter of...

748
01:13:56,872 --> 01:13:58,335
the recent discovery in the Pacific...

749
01:13:58,435 --> 01:14:00,967
of an island which will be known hence forth

750
01:14:01,147 --> 01:14:03,227
as Atoll H.

751
01:14:03,497 --> 01:14:06,573
I beg your pardon. Atoll K.

752
01:14:07,381 --> 01:14:09,831
After a fortnight of conferences...

753
01:14:09,931 --> 01:14:12,431
The great powers in a joint
statement issued today,

754
01:14:12,531 --> 01:14:15,087
announced the appointment
of an international commission...

755
01:14:15,187 --> 01:14:18,336
to decide which nation
will be awarded sovereignty rights...

756
01:14:18,436 --> 01:14:21,679
over the island which has emerged
from the ocean only a short time ago

757
01:14:21,779 --> 01:14:24,194
and will be known as Atoll K.

758
01:14:24,394 --> 01:14:27,307
<i>This statement was welcomed</i>
<i>with relief in the world capitals.</i>

759
01:14:27,418 --> 01:14:29,645
<i>Now it has become only a question of time</i>

760
01:14:29,745 --> 01:14:32,943
<i>before some government</i>
<i>raises it's flag over Atoll K.</i>

761
01:14:33,728 --> 01:14:35,957
Some government's flag, they say.

762
01:14:36,521 --> 01:14:37,939
Do you hear that?

763
01:14:38,039 --> 01:14:40,663
Well, why don't we make
a government of our own?

764
01:14:40,763 --> 01:14:42,213
Chérie's right!

765
01:14:45,154 --> 01:14:49,529
I'll write a constitution
like has never been written before.

766
01:14:51,786 --> 01:14:52,939
Sharpen this!

767
01:15:04,857 --> 01:15:07,877
This will have to be a short constitution.

768
01:15:09,684 --> 01:15:10,697
Now...

769
01:15:11,597 --> 01:15:12,657
We,

770
01:15:12,957 --> 01:15:14,477
the people...

771
01:15:15,484 --> 01:15:16,536
of...

772
01:15:18,020 --> 01:15:19,063
of...

773
01:15:20,481 --> 01:15:22,278
Crusoeland,

774
01:15:26,395 --> 01:15:28,942
in order to save our island,

775
01:15:29,460 --> 01:15:35,424
do hereby form a government.

776
01:15:36,902 --> 01:15:38,568
Now, what kind of government do we want?

777
01:15:38,668 --> 01:15:40,682
Very little government
would be good, I think.

778
01:15:40,782 --> 01:15:43,020
- Without too many laws.
- And no passports.

779
01:15:43,265 --> 01:15:45,506
No passports.

780
01:15:45,606 --> 01:15:48,365
- And no prisons.
- No prisons.

781
01:15:52,371 --> 01:15:53,377
What?

782
01:15:55,553 --> 01:15:58,257
- No taxes.
- No taxes.

783
01:15:59,368 --> 01:16:01,868
This is getting to be a perfect government.

784
01:16:02,026 --> 01:16:05,701
And I will add, no laws and no money.

785
01:16:06,621 --> 01:16:08,381
And that's all we have room for.

786
01:16:08,791 --> 01:16:11,048
Now, the next thing is to hold an election.

787
01:16:11,149 --> 01:16:13,239
I vote for myself as President.

788
01:16:13,339 --> 01:16:17,200
- And Stanley seconds the motion.
- But I'm the discoverer of our island!

789
01:16:17,300 --> 01:16:19,345
I vote for me!
You vote for me too, don't you?

790
01:16:19,445 --> 01:16:20,736
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

791
01:16:20,837 --> 01:16:22,639
Giovanni votes only for Giovanni.

792
01:16:23,566 --> 01:16:24,980
Electioneering is over.

793
01:16:30,420 --> 01:16:33,226
Chérie, count the votes.

794
01:16:33,942 --> 01:16:35,728
One vote for Giovanni.

795
01:16:36,268 --> 01:16:38,001
One vote for Antoine.

796
01:16:38,801 --> 01:16:43,527
One, two, three...
Three votes for Oliver Crusoe.

797
01:16:43,627 --> 01:16:46,627
The President is elected
by a comfortable majority.

798
01:16:51,293 --> 01:16:55,073
As President of Crusoeland,
I will now choose my cabinet.

799
01:16:55,482 --> 01:17:01,029
- Chérie, you are my Vice President.
- Oh, thank you, Mr. President.

800
01:17:01,415 --> 01:17:04,695
Antoine, you are my foreign minister.

801
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:06,628
I am very proud.

802
01:17:07,175 --> 01:17:10,279
Giovanni, you are the
minister of construction.

803
01:17:10,379 --> 01:17:12,807
You couldn't have
made a better choice.

804
01:17:14,065 --> 01:17:15,182
Well, that's that.

805
01:17:19,322 --> 01:17:20,655
What about me?

806
01:17:20,842 --> 01:17:23,457
Stanley, you are the people!

807
01:17:24,032 --> 01:17:26,045
I don't want to be the people!

808
01:17:26,309 --> 01:17:28,569
What do you mean,
you don't want to be the people?

809
01:17:28,669 --> 01:17:30,698
There are more of you than there are of us!

810
01:17:31,018 --> 01:17:33,660
- You mean, there's a lot of me?
- Certainly!

811
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:36,569
Oh, why didn't you tell me? I didn't know.

812
01:17:37,545 --> 01:17:38,771
Mr. President,

813
01:17:38,978 --> 01:17:41,169
but now we will have to have a flag.

814
01:17:41,269 --> 01:17:44,361
Giovanni's right. We can't have
a government without a flag.

815
01:17:46,729 --> 01:17:48,471
Can't we use this as a flag?

816
01:17:48,571 --> 01:17:50,344
That will be perfect!

817
01:17:50,562 --> 01:17:52,468
Yes, but we will need an emblem.

818
01:17:53,075 --> 01:17:55,517
Wait a second. I have an idea.

819
01:18:39,034 --> 01:18:42,127
That is impossible to keep this house clean.

820
01:18:44,067 --> 01:18:45,880
Look at that. Terrible.

821
01:18:51,647 --> 01:18:53,420
See? The dust did that.

822
01:19:21,930 --> 01:19:24,228
- Stan, Ollie!
- What happened?

823
01:19:24,328 --> 01:19:27,606
- Looks like we're being invaded.
- What happened? Take a look at the beach.

824
01:19:42,083 --> 01:19:46,530
Under the principle of self determination,
the constitution proposed by the government,

825
01:19:46,630 --> 01:19:48,862
has been ratified by unanimous vote.

826
01:19:49,735 --> 01:19:55,348
We have no other alternative but to recognise
this new sovereign state, the Crusoeland.

827
01:20:42,365 --> 01:20:43,368
Pardon me.

828
01:20:45,128 --> 01:20:46,134
Pardon me.

829
01:20:50,818 --> 01:20:53,409
Oh, boy, oh, boy.
It's a great hit, my bouillabaisse

830
01:20:53,509 --> 01:20:57,305
- Waiter, waiter! - Yes, yes, yes.
- Antoine, more bouillabaisse. - Yes.

831
01:20:57,405 --> 01:20:59,823
- Poor Antoine.
- Poor Antoine's right, huh?

832
01:21:05,365 --> 01:21:07,651
- Honestly, what I owe you, buddy?
- Nothing.

833
01:21:07,751 --> 01:21:08,564
Nothing at all?

834
01:21:08,664 --> 01:21:11,604
Absolutely nothing.
This is a free country.

835
01:21:11,931 --> 01:21:14,558
Oh, boy.
If I'd known that I'd taken a bottle.

836
01:21:14,691 --> 01:21:15,805
Here, take one.

837
01:21:16,084 --> 01:21:19,090
- Give him another one, Stanley.
- Well, certainly.

838
01:21:19,385 --> 01:21:22,557
Oh, Geez, thanks, mister.
Thanks a million, mister.

839
01:21:23,591 --> 01:21:24,598
Give me that.

840
01:21:32,547 --> 01:21:34,441
Who said you could give that stuff away?

841
01:21:34,547 --> 01:21:36,664
I brought this licor out here,
so I could sell it.

842
01:21:36,764 --> 01:21:37,445
I want cash.

843
01:21:37,545 --> 01:21:40,120
But money is against
the rules of our constitution.

844
01:21:40,220 --> 01:21:43,541
- Yean, and we have no taxes, either.
- Oh, yeah?

845
01:21:43,950 --> 01:21:45,710
Taxes I don't care about.

846
01:21:46,110 --> 01:21:47,650
You gotta make money for 'em.

847
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:50,483
- Farewell.
- Out of my way, fatty!

848
01:21:51,243 --> 01:21:53,223
Give me a bottle of cognac!

849
01:21:58,525 --> 01:21:59,612
Which one?

850
01:22:04,667 --> 01:22:05,680
That one!

851
01:22:11,441 --> 01:22:13,668
I'm sorry, but you'll have to pay for that.

852
01:22:13,788 --> 01:22:15,008
Who said so?

853
01:22:16,047 --> 01:22:17,061
He did.

854
01:22:30,635 --> 01:22:31,921
What are you having?

855
01:22:32,608 --> 01:22:33,616
You!

856
01:22:33,716 --> 01:22:35,668
Let me go. You can't do that.

857
01:22:36,341 --> 01:22:38,130
They said it's a free country here.

858
01:22:38,230 --> 01:22:41,394
As President of this island
I demand that you desist.

859
01:22:51,153 --> 01:22:52,646
Do that again!

860
01:22:56,818 --> 01:22:59,028
You keep out of this, nitwit!

861
01:22:59,128 --> 01:23:01,308
I'll have you thrown off
of this island for that!

862
01:23:01,408 --> 01:23:02,888
Yeah, we'll have you imported.

863
01:23:02,988 --> 01:23:06,232
If I were you, my fine friends,
I wouldn't be too sure.

864
01:23:08,303 --> 01:23:09,362
See you later.

865
01:23:11,102 --> 01:23:12,091
Gentlemen.

866
01:23:12,191 --> 01:23:16,229
I'll have him thrown off this island,
if it's the last thing I do!

867
01:23:16,329 --> 01:23:18,186
- That's not possible.
- Why not?

868
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:21,055
- Because we have no such laws.
- Yes. That would be pretty difficult.

869
01:23:21,155 --> 01:23:23,111
We'd be forced to change the constitution.

870
01:23:23,211 --> 01:23:25,183
If you want my advice, Mr. President,

871
01:23:25,536 --> 01:23:28,496
- call a meeting of the cabinet.
- That's a good idea. Come on.

872
01:23:28,750 --> 01:23:30,730
We'll attend to that right now!

873
01:23:32,595 --> 01:23:34,955
Enjoy yourself, folks. We'll be right back.

874
01:23:39,355 --> 01:23:42,648
This island is a paradise governed by idiots.

875
01:23:43,048 --> 01:23:44,482
A man like me

876
01:23:45,000 --> 01:23:50,507
could put himself in power and lay his hands
on its trunk of money. Just think of it.

877
01:23:51,308 --> 01:23:52,652
You want to come in on it with me?

878
01:23:52,752 --> 01:23:55,044
It sounds alright, but what
are the people going to say?

879
01:23:55,145 --> 01:23:58,910
- They're happy with things the way they are.
- The people. Haha!

880
01:23:59,137 --> 01:24:01,077
We're just telling them they're not happy.

881
01:24:01,230 --> 01:24:03,137
They're always ready to believe that.

882
01:24:03,330 --> 01:24:05,777
We'll have to organize a few demonstrations.

883
01:24:05,897 --> 01:24:09,448
That will show them how dangerous it is
to live without law.

884
01:24:09,548 --> 01:24:10,644
I'm afraid you're late.

885
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,574
The president has just
put up a proclamation

886
01:24:12,674 --> 01:24:15,658
declaring that from now on
law and order will be the rule.

887
01:24:38,967 --> 01:24:40,816
It sure is quiet out there.

888
01:24:40,916 --> 01:24:44,285
That's because I showed
a firm hand with our proclamation.

889
01:24:58,776 --> 01:25:02,272
And now I'll make a tour round the island
and test the public's reaction.

890
01:25:04,675 --> 01:25:05,842
You don't have to.

891
01:25:06,041 --> 01:25:09,214
- They're coming to visit you.
- They're coming to apologise.

892
01:25:10,671 --> 01:25:13,457
I knew that would
bring them to their senses.

893
01:25:18,914 --> 01:25:20,385
Who wrote that?

894
01:25:20,751 --> 01:25:21,813
He did.

895
01:25:25,782 --> 01:25:28,713
- I now put you under arrest.
- But he's the President.

896
01:25:28,813 --> 01:25:30,455
He certainly is.

897
01:25:33,620 --> 01:25:34,993
Why don't you hang him?

898
01:25:35,535 --> 01:25:38,998
You have just given me an excellent idea.

899
01:25:39,098 --> 01:25:41,334
As defender of law and order

900
01:25:41,434 --> 01:25:44,576
I can guarantee you'll
have a fair and honest trial.

901
01:25:44,712 --> 01:25:46,786
You will confess everything,

902
01:25:46,886 --> 01:25:50,140
and then you'll be hanged
like gentlemen at sunrise.

903
01:25:50,240 --> 01:25:51,571
Thank you very much.

904
01:25:55,477 --> 01:25:56,624
What'd he say?

905
01:25:57,024 --> 01:25:59,852
Why don't you keep your big mouth shut?

906
01:25:59,952 --> 01:26:01,390
Are you going to hang her too?

907
01:26:02,009 --> 01:26:03,270
Of course not.

908
01:26:03,842 --> 01:26:05,796
She is much too beautiful.

909
01:26:06,236 --> 01:26:08,296
If you will consent, my dear,

910
01:26:09,062 --> 01:26:12,845
I'll take you under my personal protection.

911
01:26:12,945 --> 01:26:17,230
- What can I say, but thank you.
- I can't believe my ears.

912
01:26:17,623 --> 01:26:21,623
Well, if you can't believe those ears,
you can't believe anything.

913
01:26:21,729 --> 01:26:23,504
Put some guards around the house.

914
01:26:23,604 --> 01:26:26,722
I'll immediately go and start
a crew building a gallows.

915
01:26:27,011 --> 01:26:32,291
Oh, by the way, now that I'm going
to be President, I'll need that outfit.

916
01:26:32,531 --> 01:26:35,944
- Will you accompany me, my dear?
- But of course.

917
01:26:44,977 --> 01:26:47,924
- I still can't believe my...
- Oh, shut up!

918
01:27:01,072 --> 01:27:03,225
See if the guards are still out there.

919
01:27:18,088 --> 01:27:19,288
He missed me!

920
01:27:30,131 --> 01:27:31,881
Attention! Attention!

921
01:27:31,981 --> 01:27:34,554
Commander in chief,
geographic station Tahiti,

922
01:27:34,654 --> 01:27:36,097
calling Lieutenant Frazer.

923
01:27:36,197 --> 01:27:37,246
SS area,

924
01:27:37,369 --> 01:27:41,946
report your position.
8:30 a.m., wavelength 15 metres. Over.

925
01:27:42,046 --> 01:27:44,631
Lucky I was hired to come here
as a radio operator.

926
01:27:44,942 --> 01:27:46,395
Without Alecto I'd be sunk.

927
01:27:46,495 --> 01:27:49,347
Which reminds me,
he was just looking for you, Alecto.

928
01:27:51,419 --> 01:27:52,422
Where is he?

929
01:27:52,522 --> 01:27:54,174
Oh, over there.

930
01:27:59,298 --> 01:28:00,289
Hello.

931
01:28:00,389 --> 01:28:01,736
Lieutenant Frazer.

932
01:28:02,035 --> 01:28:03,407
Lieutenant Frazer!

933
01:28:07,378 --> 01:28:09,165
Lieutenant, it's for you.

934
01:28:12,847 --> 01:28:14,032
Sounds like a dame.

935
01:28:14,132 --> 01:28:15,336
<i>Lieutenant Frazer.</i>

936
01:28:15,436 --> 01:28:16,649
Lieutenant Frazer!

937
01:28:16,749 --> 01:28:18,081
Hello, snow white.

938
01:28:18,541 --> 01:28:20,425
Don't tell me the dwarves are annoying you.

939
01:28:20,525 --> 01:28:23,113
Hello, Jack. Oh, listen to me.
You've got to come right away.

940
01:28:23,213 --> 01:28:24,977
They started a revolution.
They build the gallows.

941
01:28:25,077 --> 01:28:26,424
They're going to hang everyone.

942
01:28:26,524 --> 01:28:28,105
I need you! Do you hear me?

943
01:28:29,248 --> 01:28:31,521
Change your course, 20 points to starboard.

944
01:28:34,982 --> 01:28:36,228
Of course I can hear you.

945
01:28:37,182 --> 01:28:38,626
But you don't really need me.

946
01:28:38,726 --> 01:28:41,312
But, Jack, don't kid me.
There isn't a minue to lose.

947
01:28:41,412 --> 01:28:43,051
- If you love me...
- You, too.

948
01:28:43,217 --> 01:28:47,534
Round up everybody and tell them the
traitors of the government of Carusoeland

949
01:28:47,634 --> 01:28:49,523
will be hanged within the hour.

950
01:28:49,623 --> 01:28:52,865
And now let's get the principal actors.
Hip hip hurra!

951
01:29:02,777 --> 01:29:07,337
One, two, three, four... Let's go!

952
01:30:33,380 --> 01:30:35,944
- Get away! Quick!
- Is this another one of your tricks?

953
01:30:36,044 --> 01:30:38,986
- What do you mean, tricks?
- Tricks. Sure, she's full of them.

954
01:30:39,086 --> 01:30:41,917
- We go outside and the guards shoot us.
- You're wrong!

955
01:30:42,028 --> 01:30:44,326
I just got rid of the guards outside.

956
01:30:44,426 --> 01:30:46,041
I put a stone in my purse.

957
01:30:47,916 --> 01:30:51,999
I went with Alecto only because one of us
had to remain free to save the others.

958
01:30:52,099 --> 01:30:54,129
- What are we waiting for?
- Come on!

959
01:30:55,559 --> 01:30:58,810
- No. I'm staying here.
- But we can't leave you here!

960
01:30:58,910 --> 01:31:01,173
I've got to stay here
and send them in the other direction.

961
01:31:01,273 --> 01:31:04,697
- Thank you very much, miss.
- Now hurry up! Hurry up!

962
01:31:30,285 --> 01:31:32,523
- But how did it happen?
- I haven't got time to explain!

963
01:31:32,623 --> 01:31:34,832
You've got to run and
try to catch those brutes.

964
01:31:35,431 --> 01:31:37,771
But did you notice which way they went?

965
01:31:38,179 --> 01:31:40,538
- That way!
- Follow me!

966
01:32:06,719 --> 01:32:07,740
Follow me!

967
01:32:23,477 --> 01:32:25,273
Hurry up! They went this way!

968
01:32:36,540 --> 01:32:37,821
Hey, look at that!

969
01:32:55,558 --> 01:32:57,175
I think we're safe here.

970
01:32:58,188 --> 01:32:59,234
Don't you?

971
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:13,092
He must have fainted.

972
01:33:27,875 --> 01:33:28,962
What happened?

973
01:33:38,058 --> 01:33:39,141
Chérie!

974
01:33:40,798 --> 01:33:41,978
It's Chérie!

975
01:33:47,793 --> 01:33:52,946
Stan, answer me. Forgive me.
I didn't know it was you. Please, look at me.

976
01:33:54,911 --> 01:33:58,164
- How did you manage to catch them?
- But I... I...

977
01:33:59,119 --> 01:34:02,738
The girl is absolutely wonderful.
She has a stone in her bag!

978
01:34:04,786 --> 01:34:05,806
Quick!

979
01:34:05,984 --> 01:34:08,972
Get them out of here! We're going to give
the signal for the show to begin.

980
01:34:09,204 --> 01:34:14,357
As a token of thanks for your help,
without which I would never have succeeded,

981
01:34:14,825 --> 01:34:17,896
I am giving you the honour
of pulling the lever

982
01:34:17,996 --> 01:34:21,730
that will drop these
traitors into eternity.

983
01:34:32,096 --> 01:34:34,183
Alecto! Alecto!

984
01:34:34,283 --> 01:34:37,552
- This girl is in cahoots with the traitors!
- Look where he's standing.

985
01:34:37,652 --> 01:34:40,965
- What are you talking about?
- She overpowered us and let them escape!

986
01:35:52,367 --> 01:35:53,839
I don't get it. I've just been checking.

987
01:35:53,939 --> 01:35:56,552
We're exactly on the position
where the island stood.

988
01:35:59,904 --> 01:36:02,251
<i>This is what you would call a lucky break.</i>

989
01:36:05,195 --> 01:36:07,115
Oh, no!

990
01:36:07,234 --> 01:36:08,659
What do you mean, no?

991
01:36:08,759 --> 01:36:11,250
- I don't want to be rescued by him!
- Why not?

992
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:12,864
He was too long getting here!

993
01:36:13,246 --> 01:36:18,153
<i>This world of ours is definitely no fair</i>
<i>place but people go on living just the same.</i>

994
01:36:18,525 --> 01:36:21,119
<i>Chérie Lamour is finally</i>
<i>marrying her Lieutenant.</i>

995
01:36:21,219 --> 01:36:24,832
<i>And they look forward to many years
of happily married life.</i>

996
01:36:24,932 --> 01:36:25,927
...and never jilted me!

997
01:36:26,027 --> 01:36:28,431
Do you take for your
wedded wife Miss Chérie Lamour?

998
01:36:28,531 --> 01:36:29,528
OK, OK!

999
01:36:29,628 --> 01:36:30,605
Right, right.

1000
01:36:30,705 --> 01:36:33,514
- I now pronounce you man and wife.
- Is that why you've jilted me?

1001
01:36:33,614 --> 01:36:34,854
- I jilted you, you say?
- Yes!

1002
01:36:34,954 --> 01:36:37,210
<i>Giovanni has gone back to his native Italy.</i>

1003
01:36:37,310 --> 01:36:41,828
<i>Instead of building marble palaces,</i>
<i>he'll go on forever building fences.</i>

1004
01:36:42,818 --> 01:36:45,885
<i>Antoine has been brought back</i>
<i>to the boat from which he ran away.</i>

1005
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:48,516
<i>Still anxious to give up</i>
<i>this life of wandering,</i>

1006
01:36:48,616 --> 01:36:51,544
<i>he tries once more</i>
<i>his usual means of escape.</i>

1007
01:36:51,746 --> 01:36:55,379
<i>But this time he's gotten</i>
<i>into the wrong sort of cage.</i>

1008
01:37:03,818 --> 01:37:05,412
<i>As for our two heroes,</i>

1009
01:37:05,512 --> 01:37:09,077
<i>after all their mishaps,</i>
<i>they've finally gotten their inheritance.</i>

1010
01:37:09,238 --> 01:37:15,129
<i>Their own south sea island and there</i>
<i>far away from all the cares of the world,</i>

1011
01:37:15,229 --> 01:37:18,385
<i>they settled down to a well earned rest.</i>

1012
01:37:18,485 --> 01:37:23,790
That was sure was nice of Frazer and Chérie
to land us here on our own real island.

1013
01:37:24,041 --> 01:37:26,441
Give us all this food and everything...

1014
01:37:26,997 --> 01:37:30,525
- Just like a fresh start in life.
- It certainly is.

1015
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:34,050
And they're going to send us
new supplies every six months.

1016
01:37:34,227 --> 01:37:37,137
At last, all of our troubles are over.

1017
01:37:37,264 --> 01:37:42,313
Yes, sir. Nothing to do
from now on but eat and sleep.

1018
01:37:42,413 --> 01:37:45,476
And nobody to tell us what to do.

1019
01:37:48,225 --> 01:37:51,182
- What are you doing here?
- What are we doing here?

1020
01:37:51,282 --> 01:37:52,985
Well, this is our island!

1021
01:37:53,472 --> 01:37:54,649
There must be some mistake.

1022
01:37:54,749 --> 01:37:56,604
This island has been taken over
by the government

1023
01:37:56,704 --> 01:37:59,019
for insufficient payment
of inheritance taxes.

1024
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:01,512
Moreover, you've also
been fined for the delay.

1025
01:38:02,045 --> 01:38:04,399
It's my duty to seize your supplies and food.

1026
01:38:04,534 --> 01:38:05,624
Take it away!

1027
01:38:13,746 --> 01:38:17,118
Well, here's another nice mess
you've gotten me into!

1028
01:38:17,995 --> 01:38:19,214
Well, I couldn't help it.

1029
01:38:19,314 --> 01:38:23,141
You're always blaming me
for everything. I didn't know that...

1030
