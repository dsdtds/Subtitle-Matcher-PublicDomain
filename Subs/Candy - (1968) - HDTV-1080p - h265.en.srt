1
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,520
I Miss Christian!

2
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:32,520
I Miss Christian!

3
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:36,320
And well, Miss Christian...

4
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,638
<-O->- ... we are waiting
for you, Miss Christian.

5
00:03:39,639 --> 00:03:42,059
<-O->-Sorry, I have not
heard the question.

6
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:45,200
<-O->-What? <-O->-I have
Not heard the question.

7
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,120
Yes, I see.

8
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:53,019
<-O->-You have not heard the
question, right? -Yes, dad.

9
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:55,979
<-O->-What? <-O->-Yes, Mr. Christian.

10
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:01,240
Very well. Now it seems
that we will get somewhere.

11
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,179
Miss Christian, espéreme in the
hallway, at the end of the class.

12
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,139
Tomorrow we will submit a work,

13
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,819
on the subject "the duties of
The citizen to the government",

14
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:19,259
the Church, the School, the
parents, the community...

15
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:22,200
"and the local police."

16
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:43,160
I feel me angry, Candy. Oh forgive me!

17
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:47,219
Sure, dad!

18
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,659
You must think I'm a little weird...

19
00:04:49,660 --> 00:04:51,879
and a dad very rare and
plated to the old one.

20
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,299
- Huh?
- Just a little! <-O->-Many thanks.

21
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:57,559
<-O->-Dad, I... -No, I have already
understood. You don't have to say anything.

22
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,879
I know what you mean. I don't
need to explain anything.

23
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:01,519
I know as I called students to my back.

24
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,179
No one says anything about
you behind your back, dad.

25
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,099
That is precisely what I say.

26
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,000
All the other teachers of
the School I nicknames;

27
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,979
But to me just call me Mr. Christian.

28
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:15,320
Oh, don't take it as well! All
of them landing very well.

29
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,759
- What is the truth?
- Of Course.

30
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,540
Believe that you are a prof very nice.

31
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,619
Thank you, sweetie.

32
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:26,240
Oh, that makes me feel good!

33
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,480
O my daughter, I'm glad we had this talk!

34
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,600
A girl and her father must be good friends,

35
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:38,080
<-O->- ... like us. <-O->-Oh, dad!

36
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,400
What do I do!

37
00:05:42,980 --> 00:05:45,979
<-O->-Hello!
- Oh, Excuse Me, Mr. Christian! What happens, Harold?

38
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,779
I just came to tell Candy that is given
in a hurry. You will be late. Come on!

39
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,539
Is a good boy!
Always. And a good student.

40
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:55,579
<-O->-Oh, Dad, I have to leave!
<-O->-You see to often, right?

41
00:05:55,580 --> 00:05:58,779
I just want to be sure that you
will not make any madness.

42
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:02,339
<-O->-I have to go. -Very well. Then
we will have a talk from man to man.

43
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,499
<-O->-Very well.
- Will you come to my Sociology class of the 5?

44
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:08,459
<-O->-We'll see you there. -Very well.
<-O->-But, what's wrong with you?

45
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,560
It Mac Phisto!

46
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:12,840
What Mac Phisto?

47
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:41,720
It Mac Phisto!

48
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,739
"The life that burns and bleeds,"

49
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:49,019
"in my triumph days sieved sleep,"

50
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:52,019
"in that I towered brilliantly,"

51
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:55,819
in the dream sustained...

52
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,619
"the vision of an eagle...

53
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,259
"that transports us
between the knobbly pores,

54
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:06,579
"that surround our meat, clean words,

55
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:08,659
"and that throws its
cry bitter and nameless,

56
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,859
"as a scream for ice cream,"

57
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:15,579
"shaken with passion by a wind,"

58
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:18,019
"in which my weariness is rampant,"

59
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,760
"overflowing with this liquid..."

60
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:25,920
"of my lust."

61
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:05,320
The poem that I just
recited was composed...

62
00:09:05,780 --> 00:09:08,659
in a hospital in Burma,

63
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:11,219
in which lay, near death,

64
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:13,899
after you have been savagely attacked...

65
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,640
by a rampant horde of belgian tourists.

66
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,499
You can find this poem in my
collection of verses entitled:

67
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:27,539
"Forests of meat".

68
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,979
Here has not been published yet,

69
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,179
but you can find a private edition,

70
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:39,600
signed personally by
its author, which is me,

71
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:43,200
$ 3,

72
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:48,840
cash or by transfer...

73
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:53,139
Mac-Phisto,

74
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:57,360
Po Box 2723,

75
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:00,800
Lemington,

76
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,579
New Jersey.

77
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,680
Mac Phisto, Po Box 2723.
Lemington. New Jersey.

78
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:21,459
I would like to express my
gratitude to the Rolling Stones,

79
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:23,360
I say, Rolling...

80
00:10:25,060 --> 00:10:28,259
the Rolling Fields Center,

81
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:33,640
and the student Council
supervisor of this School

82
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:35,819
who had the courage...

83
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:38,779
and, I would say, the intelligence...

84
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:41,019
invited me here.

85
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:43,899
As you know, my work has been banned...

86
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:48,579
and my books burned in 27 countries
are already consolidated...

87
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:52,840
and 14 emerging nations. <-O->-I'd
like to see him at once. Me.

88
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:56,859
"Why what are you afraid of me?"

89
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,859
should one ask.

90
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:00,640
Why?

91
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:06,459
Because exult the virtue,
the beauty, the magic...

92
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:11,539
and the supreme and ineffable desire...

93
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:14,880
ecstasy of the human spirit.

94
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:19,720
Or Dulcis Imperatrix!
()

95
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:23,480
I mean that's what it is!

96
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:28,339
My poems have the innocence of
the young and innocent children,

97
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:31,499
as only children can
understand the freedom...

98
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,960
and the virtue of giving one's
self without restrictions,

99
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:40,240
without inhibitions and without shame.

100
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,219
And I wonder...

101
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,400
how many people here have the
gift of being able to sacrifice.

102
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:50,720
I think that perhaps some of you;

103
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,760
Ten or twenty,

104
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:57,160
three or four.

105
00:11:58,100 --> 00:12:00,040
Perhaps...

106
00:12:01,340 --> 00:12:03,560
only one.

107
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:11,059
Miss Quimby, who exactly
is that Mac Phisto?

108
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,859
Do not know You, who is Mac Phisto?
I'm surprised You Mr. Christian!

109
00:12:15,860 --> 00:12:17,659
Do not read You poetry?

110
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,979
I don't have time for poetry. I
teach Sociology, not Humanities.

111
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,099
Because it is one of the most celebrated
poets of the TWENTIETH century.

112
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,699
I've devoured mountains;

113
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:31,339
I eat the Sky and drink the Ocean,

114
00:12:31,340 --> 00:12:34,099
until I have become the Universe.

115
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,120
The Universe I am! Me! Me! Me!

116
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,019
Where are you?

117
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:38,539
In the Mercedes.

118
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:42,480
This time leading me. You
will need to use your hands.

119
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:21,000
I...

120
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:22,499
I am a Mac Phisto.

121
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,739
Hello! My name is Candy.

122
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,419
Candy Christian.

123
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:31,819
Oh Candy! A beautiful name with
echoes of the Old Testament.

124
00:14:31,820 --> 00:14:34,040
Thank you.

125
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:37,499
I would like to that would
allow me to escort her home.

126
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,080
That will be great.

127
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,699
Where do you live?

128
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:46,200
In the 83571/2 Schweitzer Terrace.

129
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,179
- Zero, can you find the 83...
- 571/2

130
00:14:55,180 --> 00:15:00,120
571/2 Schweitzer Terrace.
<-O->-I Received!

131
00:15:01,980 --> 00:15:04,819
Oh that was Zero!

132
00:15:04,820 --> 00:15:08,499
<-O->-What driver? <-O->-No, my friend.

133
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,619
Some years ago I was
travelling up the Congo.

134
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:17,200
One day, after having
recited one of my poems...

135
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:21,880
to an audience of at
least 700 warriors Gonori,

136
00:15:22,060 --> 00:15:24,720
a tribe of cruel, thirsty for poetry,

137
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:31,219
I could see a clearing in
the forest to a poor indian,

138
00:15:31,220 --> 00:15:35,179
that was being attacked
by a giant python snake.

139
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,379
The man had already been half
devoured when I arrived...

140
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,819
and you grabbed it from the jaws
of that beast that threw foam.

141
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:48,280
Then, I ended up with the animal with
a single and sharp blow of my...

142
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,539
ballpoint pen.

143
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:54,659
After sixteen delicate operations
on the feet and the brain,

144
00:15:54,660 --> 00:15:56,979
Zéro was able to walk again.

145
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:00,139
From then on, we never separate.

146
00:16:00,140 --> 00:16:04,400
I've seen this story
Tuesday night on the Tele.

147
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:06,179
Then let's say...

148
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,419
I saved Zero of a lynching,

149
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,760
three years ago in Shreveport,

150
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:16,059
Louisiana, when he already
had the noose around the neck.

151
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:19,779
And then I began to recite
one of my epic poems:

152
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:24,579
"The Brotherhood of Man",
first in English and then...

153
00:16:24,580 --> 00:16:28,160
and then... in welsh.

154
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:33,139
That changed their minds and their lives.

155
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:36,259
And now there's a system full
of school integration...

156
00:16:36,260 --> 00:16:39,219
in Shreveport, Louisiana and...

157
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,499
Zero and I...

158
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,619
Are they living together since then?

159
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,680
Exactly!

160
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,960
And now...

161
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,339
I want you to tell me things of you.

162
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,019
Tell me about yourself.

163
00:16:51,020 --> 00:16:54,520
What is it that you're looking for?
What do you believe?

164
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,520
I believe in what you told us before.

165
00:16:57,940 --> 00:17:00,579
<-O->-Before? <-O->-Yes, in College.

166
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:06,280
When we spoke of all those who felt
free to give. Ah, yes, to give!

167
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,680
Those few,

168
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:12,859
those few and incredibly
privileged that...

169
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:15,880
that are free for you to take.

170
00:17:16,460 --> 00:17:18,180
But, what for?

171
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,139
Be one in the same.

172
00:17:20,140 --> 00:17:23,920
Yes, but to whom?

173
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,019
<-O->-All that I need. Oh,
yes, they knew and forsaw it!

174
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:34,699
From the moment I saw you, I knew that you
alone were able to understand my great...

175
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,720
my great...

176
00:17:36,740 --> 00:17:39,040
Yes?

177
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:51,640
Need. I need! I need! I need!

178
00:17:53,900 --> 00:17:57,259
My huge and gigantic need!

179
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:59,800
My huge and overwhelming need!

180
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:04,739
My huge and irresistible need!

181
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,139
I need it!

182
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:08,339
I need! I need!

183
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,059
I never deny the need! I need! I need!

184
00:18:10,060 --> 00:18:12,299
I need! I need! I need!

185
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,900
I never deny the need!

186
00:18:15,020 --> 00:18:17,139
Do not deny it, only that
I am still not prepared.

187
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:20,219
Never forget that the need can't wait.

188
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:22,099
The need is here!

189
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:24,880
The need is for now!

190
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,240
The need, the need is for now!

191
00:18:39,860 --> 00:18:42,659
Don 83571/2 Schweitzer Terrace, guys!

192
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:46,400
I get out of here, you're impeding my need!

193
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:51,059
My need! My huge need!

194
00:18:51,060 --> 00:18:52,979
Oh, no!

195
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,459
Oh, that's not good!

196
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:58,939
I need! I need!

197
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:01,419
Oh my god, look at that!

198
00:19:01,420 --> 00:19:03,339
It's disgusting!

199
00:19:03,340 --> 00:19:06,520
Well, that is love!

200
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,960
Is completely drunk and has wet everything.

201
00:19:14,020 --> 00:19:16,059
We must do something.

202
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:17,939
Help me to take it home!

203
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,099
We will remove the pants, to the dry.

204
00:19:21,100 --> 00:19:22,800
Very well.

205
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,640
Oh, that is not good!

206
00:19:28,580 --> 00:19:31,179
It is necessary to live happily!

207
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,960
That guy has wet his pants!

208
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:37,139
It is horrible! Is soaked with liquor.

209
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:39,899
A poet as famous as Mr. Mac Phisto.

210
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,419
Is to be made to think, don't you think?

211
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,459
Oh, that's not good!

212
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,360
This people do very bad things.

213
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,859
Do you think that you can walk, now?

214
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:53,399
<-O->-Not to worry. We will try it. <-O->-Are you sure?
- Sure!

215
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,620
What is going on here?

216
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:59,579
If you go down the stairs
to the games room,

217
00:19:59,580 --> 00:20:01,659
<-O->- ... I'll go get the iron.
<-O->-Not to worry.

218
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:02,699
I'll take care of it.

219
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:06,320
What have you done with my need?

220
00:20:07,220 --> 00:20:09,240
Come on, old man!

221
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:11,400
Come on! We can do it.

222
00:20:23,180 --> 00:20:26,200
Come on! We have almost arrived.

223
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,859
<-O->-O Emmanuel! <-O->-Yes, miss.

224
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,459
Please, come in. I want
you to do something.

225
00:20:41,460 --> 00:20:44,019
What Does The Inside?

226
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,539
If you please.

227
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:49,379
¡Inside, no! I know that Mr
Christian will not like that.

228
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:52,459
Doesn't matter to me, Emmanuel. I need you.

229
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:54,139
Do you need to Emmanuel?

230
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:56,059
Yes, right now.

231
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:59,240
But is that Emmanuel is a good boy.

232
00:21:05,260 --> 00:21:09,099
<-O->-I Want you to go to the kitchen to get the plate.
- Do the ironing?

233
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:13,339
<-O->-Yes, the irons. And I want to be the bring to the basement.
- What in the basement?

234
00:21:13,340 --> 00:21:17,560
Yes, please. I have to
change this dress now.

235
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,120
She wants me to do it!

236
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,819
<-O->-Let's go, friend! I'm going to
take off now for the pants. -¡No, go!

237
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:39,160
How can you dare?

238
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:43,419
Do you think that a possible candidate...

239
00:21:43,420 --> 00:21:46,179
the Nobel Prize for Literature...

240
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,360
is unable to take off
the pants by himself?

241
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:11,539
Hey, old man, you told him about it when
you saved me from the slave market...

242
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,800
Maracas?

243
00:22:22,540 --> 00:22:26,360
O Emmanuel, quick, I need the iron!

244
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:34,040
Please, give me the pants!

245
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:39,099
Yes, to give!

246
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:40,739
I give!

247
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:45,320
<-O->-The miracle of giving. -Is the
title of one of his best sonnets.

248
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:54,939
Emmanuel, leave the ironing board here.

249
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:58,019
Oh, that is not good!

250
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,819
This is the house of the devil.

251
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:13,299
You, that have a face of Aztec,

252
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:17,339
the only survivor of the
massacre of your proud race!

253
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,480
Well said, boy!

254
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:23,120
It seems like that it is cotton!

255
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,619
What is saying this man?

256
00:23:25,620 --> 00:23:27,019
It is a poem.

257
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,539
It is not a good idea! Use
the language of the devil.

258
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:33,899
No, No, Emmanuel. Speaking of life, of love
and of giving themselves to each other.

259
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:36,739
<-O->-What Happen? Do you realize what?
<-O->-self.

260
00:23:36,740 --> 00:23:38,259
Emmanuel is a good boy.

261
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:42,360
Since then. You're a good
guy and a great gardener.

262
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,139
<-O->-Bring Honor to Mexico.
- Remember that you have a client Latin blood!

263
00:23:48,140 --> 00:23:50,579
Emmanuel is a citizen of the united States.

264
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:52,899
Remember The Alamo!

265
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:57,699
<-O->-That I do.
<-O->-Remember the Revolution.

266
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:03,139
The Revolution! The Revolution!
The Revolution!

267
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,739
<-O->-The Revolution! -But that
is not what I wanted to say.

268
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:12,019
O Emmanuel, also wants to give now!

269
00:24:12,020 --> 00:24:14,800
O Emmanuel! Don't, please!

270
00:24:17,060 --> 00:24:20,019
<-O->-O gives himself!
<-O->-oh, Now, not! -Now.

271
00:24:20,020 --> 00:24:23,619
<-O->-Oh, not Now, Emmanuel! <-O->-Now!

272
00:24:23,620 --> 00:24:26,080
Oh, and she also gives it to him!

273
00:25:14,380 --> 00:25:17,179
¡Viva Zapata!

274
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:19,640
Let it go-the-go!

275
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:38,779
My house is your house!

276
00:25:38,780 --> 00:25:41,760
Oh, my God, it's dad!

277
00:25:42,780 --> 00:25:44,539
You are my brother.

278
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:47,440
Say to me what I have done wrong!

279
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:55,720
<-O->-Let's go, tell me! <-O->-Do
you Know, what is your problem?

280
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,259
You can not live only.

281
00:25:58,260 --> 00:26:00,979
You'll see how you'll love New York, Candy!

282
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:04,979
It is full of young great like you,

283
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,619
who are not afraid to
follow his instincts.

284
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,499
The only thing that I feel
is having to let my dad,

285
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,259
precisely now that you're so angry.

286
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:18,299
Thou oughtest to give thanks to God to
get out of this town, full of idiots.

287
00:26:18,300 --> 00:26:20,779
What do you think of the scandal?

288
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:25,019
Just because you were surprised
and to do it with this latino?

289
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,579
It doesn't matter.

290
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:29,739
Listen, when I was your age,
I had a japanese lover.

291
00:26:29,740 --> 00:26:33,219
We were so ardently
passionate to one another,

292
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,499
that I had to go over cold water.

293
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:37,779
On the pool table, right?

294
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:39,579
It is a pity then not to have my Polaroid!

295
00:26:39,580 --> 00:26:42,539
Please, you're talking of my daughter!

296
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:48,019
I already know. But it is useless to cry
for a little fault, in matters of love.

297
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:50,939
Well, I'll take you to the airport.

298
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:55,400
Please do not respond. Must be one
of those nasty anonymous calls.

299
00:26:56,900 --> 00:26:59,760
¡Good! He speaks to the
brothel of the Christian.

300
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,819
Thank you very much.

301
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:06,520
By the way: Your sister is here, and
it has already earned 200 turkeys.

302
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:45,379
<-O->-Hey, are following us!
<-O->-Who do we follow?

303
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:48,419
A group of bikers we are
following the heels.

304
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,459
Yes, I wish it was me he followed.

305
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:53,480
Hey, guys!

306
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,099
Isn't that, Emmanuel?

307
00:27:56,100 --> 00:28:00,320
I don't know, sweetheart. You
know him much better than I do.

308
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:23,080
Oh bitch, stand up!

309
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,080
Stand up!

310
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:31,179
It seems that you are looking for a fight.

311
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:33,740
Have you seen the girl
out of the first moto?

312
00:28:34,180 --> 00:28:36,739
It seems out of one of those
magazines that you have.

313
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:38,219
How "whips and Chains"?

314
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:40,979
No, the other: "Women of leather".

315
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,720
Yes, you're right. She is.

316
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,659
Maybe you just want to talk with us.

317
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,859
I prefer to talk with the mayor.

318
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:52,760
I have No doubt that you would.

319
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:55,219
But I assure you that we
have not come here to talk.

320
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:58,760
Maybe what you want is to give them
a kind of citizenship Education.

321
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:04,240
Not funny, Livia. Our situation
is anything but funny.

322
00:29:12,380 --> 00:29:15,320
Down there, there is your plane.

323
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:27,939
Hey, gringo! Do you have a lot of hurry?

324
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,779
Yes, we are about to catch a plane.

325
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:32,379
How about to catch a plane?

326
00:29:32,380 --> 00:29:33,739
You must be in a hurry, right?

327
00:29:33,740 --> 00:29:35,779
Do you try to flee from something?

328
00:29:35,780 --> 00:29:37,139
Oh No; Of course not!

329
00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:39,259
Oh listen to me!

330
00:29:39,260 --> 00:29:41,859
My daughter has to go to School
in New York and just try to...

331
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:45,059
For the blessed God! Why don't you
tell us what you want from us?

332
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:47,360
We want to pollita!

333
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:50,280
- What?
- What for? Do La pollita?

334
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,179
What the hell are you talking about?

335
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,779
Give us the pollita!

336
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,859
I Dánosla!

337
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:57,539
What? In the name of... oh,
hearken to me a moment!

338
00:29:57,540 --> 00:30:00,739
This is not a lost zone of the border,

339
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:05,400
where you can catch
innocent people and make...

340
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,379
mexicanadas!

341
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:09,179
Let me me fix this issue!

342
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,059
Oh wait! Oh wait a moment!

343
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:14,139
I think that we will be able to find a
solution that will leave us all happy.

344
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:16,699
All can be arranged between friends.

345
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:20,059
I have this wrist watch
that has a great value.

346
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,579
It is automatic and water resistant.

347
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,859
We don't want your watch!

348
00:30:24,860 --> 00:30:26,859
You can calculate up in
tenths of a second...

349
00:30:26,860 --> 00:30:28,859
We don't want your disgusting watch!

350
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:31,600
And also the phases of the moon.

351
00:30:37,180 --> 00:30:38,539
Oh wait a minute!

352
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,880
We're going to ease us all!

353
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,339
Do not do harm!

354
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,419
What are you, Emmanuel?

355
00:30:46,420 --> 00:30:48,880
O Emmanuel, come here!

356
00:30:52,340 --> 00:30:54,760
Emmanuel, what is it that is happening?

357
00:30:56,780 --> 00:30:59,480
Do you know him? Do you
know our little brother?

358
00:31:00,220 --> 00:31:02,780
<-O->-Well, I... -you've
disgraced our family.

359
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:06,900
<-O->-In the name of God, what are you talking about?
- Oh, Emmanuel, di...

360
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:11,200
Emmanuel is a good boy.

361
00:31:11,500 --> 00:31:13,339
Emmanuel was a nice guy...

362
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,659
Don Emmanuel was a virgin!

363
00:31:14,660 --> 00:31:16,499
Emmanuel was studying to become a priest.

364
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,659
I did not know.

365
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:20,680
I tell us who it was that
did those things with you!

366
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,320
I did not do it on purpose!

367
00:31:35,380 --> 00:31:38,940
It is absurd! We are in the TWENTIETH
century and in the united States.

368
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:47,600
Ladies, a bit of spanking is fine.
But are switching from the stripe!

369
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:51,339
Don't you dare!

370
00:31:51,340 --> 00:31:55,080
You will have given to him to lose, and
we will do the same thing with you!

371
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:02,840
Oh for the love of God, ladies!
We are all fellow citizens.

372
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:14,160
Don't, don't, hurt! This
woman belongs to me.

373
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,180
Click here!

374
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:00,040
I miss Christian, stay with me!

375
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,980
Oh wait!

376
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,120
Go up, dad!

377
00:33:33,740 --> 00:33:36,480
Oh stay with me!

378
00:34:03,820 --> 00:34:07,000
I need to get up! Attend to a wounded man.

379
00:34:16,940 --> 00:34:19,440
Oh Uncle Jack! You're hurt!

380
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:22,459
Oh my god! If you are not
in a mission of service...

381
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:26,179
would crush these
maggots with my own hands.

382
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:29,019
Has lost the knowledge.
We must do something.

383
00:34:29,020 --> 00:34:31,699
Who were they? I have not
been able to see great thing,

384
00:34:31,700 --> 00:34:34,419
but I'm sure they were just garbage.

385
00:34:34,420 --> 00:34:35,459
How Were Albanians?

386
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,179
No, it was just something personal.

387
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:40,899
I'm sure they had the face of albanians.

388
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:43,139
Not only were mexicans.

389
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:46,059
Mexicans, albanians,

390
00:34:46,060 --> 00:34:49,960
lithuanians. They are all the same.

391
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:51,979
I was never the first in my class,

392
00:34:51,980 --> 00:34:56,120
but I know recognize all
of these clandestine groups.

393
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:01,480
Listen up! I think that my brother is
injured. Could you not do something for him?

394
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:06,139
Okay, let me pass! Let me pass!

395
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:08,579
Oh and do me a bit of the site!

396
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:10,460
I watch those hands, Charlie!

397
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:15,699
Inside, there is still a beating heart.

398
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:18,739
These cockroaches have not
yet been able to kill us.

399
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:20,059
Can I do something?

400
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:23,179
I can hope and pray, young
lady, and You do the same.

401
00:35:23,180 --> 00:35:25,859
They still have not been able to take this!

402
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,619
Everything has been my fault.

403
00:35:27,620 --> 00:35:32,099
I don't doubt it, but I've already
seen in my life many wounded.

404
00:35:32,100 --> 00:35:35,019
This man is in a very bad state.
Let's stick to the facts.

405
00:35:35,020 --> 00:35:37,840
That liquid, which flows
from its head, it is blood!

406
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:41,520
Oh dad, say something!

407
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,619
No, No,

408
00:35:43,620 --> 00:35:45,379
no tears now.

409
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:47,019
Soldiers don't cry.

410
00:35:47,020 --> 00:35:48,459
Is there a doctor on board?

411
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:50,179
To a negative!

412
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:52,539
Fantastic! What kind of squadron is this?

413
00:35:52,540 --> 00:35:55,299
We fly fast, we attack and
we go back to the base.

414
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:59,059
Forsake the fallen. That is the
price we pay for democracy.

415
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:02,099
Just wait! I have friends who are
very influential in Washington.

416
00:36:02,100 --> 00:36:03,539
I have no doubt of it.

417
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:06,579
Sure are a bunch of leftists.

418
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:10,419
I would bet that you know many
communists are well located.

419
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:12,899
Well, let me tell you one thing:

420
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,459
Here these gentlemen don't send anything.

421
00:36:15,460 --> 00:36:17,299
Just wait a moment! I
wasn't trying to say...

422
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:19,960
Do You, perhaps, a Political
Science professor?

423
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,860
What stock broker?

424
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:25,019
Can subscriber to the New York Times?

425
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:28,699
Do you see foreign movies and
even, sometimes, eat caviar?

426
00:36:28,700 --> 00:36:30,419
What does that have to do to eat it or not?

427
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:33,419
Let me tell you something,
mister, lover of the caviar...

428
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,379
and now the one who speaks
to him is this simple mono!

429
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:39,179
And why I relate to all of you!

430
00:36:39,180 --> 00:36:43,019
Special order of the Army n° 902783.

431
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:47,739
All those going to board
this device, are my orders.

432
00:36:47,740 --> 00:36:50,219
To the orders of R. A.
Smight, general of brigade.

433
00:36:50,220 --> 00:36:54,299
Special unit of Paratroopers
on reconnaissance mission.

434
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,779
I am responsible for the
success of this mission,

435
00:36:56,780 --> 00:37:00,979
which consists in flying over continuously,
except when you have to refuel or stock up,

436
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:04,899
until the General Headquarters,
at any time, we are told to throw...

437
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:07,979
and to fulfill our work. Understood?

438
00:37:07,980 --> 00:37:10,499
<-O->-But that man... <-O->-Oh, That man!
"That man!"

439
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:14,579
I have in my charge, 24 men!
Do you understand it?

440
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:18,339
- I 24! It numbered!
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5

441
00:37:18,340 --> 00:37:22,299
&, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16, 17,18

442
00:37:22,300 --> 00:37:27,899
- 19, 20, 2, 22, 23, 24.
- Bingo!

443
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:29,659
It is impressive, isn't it

444
00:37:29,660 --> 00:37:33,099
I would say that your men can count
up to 24, without being wrong once.

445
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:37,040
<-O->-What's more they know how to make
their guys? <-O->-What You like, lady.

446
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:41,099
Don't tempt him!

447
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,459
Are you ready to do any thing.

448
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:44,819
Eighteen months of flight,

449
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:48,899
do not have off - do not turn
off, repeat - his ardour of combat.

450
00:37:48,900 --> 00:37:51,120
Oh look at this!

451
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:31,480
Oh my god,

452
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:35,240
if this is not again
proud to be americans,

453
00:38:36,180 --> 00:38:39,219
is that I don't have
blood in your veins!

454
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,499
You have done a great dance number,

455
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:46,639
but let's be realistic: My
brother-in-law is in a coma.

456
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,779
Yes, you are losing a lot of blood.

457
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,360
You need a transfusion.

458
00:38:53,980 --> 00:38:56,640
<-O->-What? <-O->-A transfusion.

459
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:04,480
<-O->-Do A transfusion?
<-O->-oh, General, please!

460
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:06,360
I will do whatever!

461
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,840
Whatever

462
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:18,440
Don Fischer! Chester!
Bring the first aid kit.

463
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:24,880
Prepare this man for a blood transfusion!

464
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:33,520
<-O->-He loved this jacket.
<-O->-Let Donors! We need donors.

465
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,120
Just wait a moment! Don't move!

466
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:42,239
<-O->-That man is your
brother, right? -Yes.

467
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:45,179
- And what all of You are family to him?
- Of course.

468
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:48,979
So, tell me in the name of God what is
what you plan. -I do not understand.

469
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:52,819
What I want to say, my lord, is that...

470
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:56,139
can not give blood to a
member of your own family.

471
00:39:56,140 --> 00:39:57,179
Why not?

472
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,979
Why not?

473
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,099
<-O->-Why not? <-O->-That is what I ask.

474
00:40:01,100 --> 00:40:04,080
Because it is...

475
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:08,200
is incest.

476
00:40:14,580 --> 00:40:16,360
Am I wrong?

477
00:40:20,140 --> 00:40:21,539
<-O->General- ... <- O->-Yes.

478
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,739
<-O->-Come here for a moment.
<-O->-Yes, what happens? What happens?

479
00:40:24,740 --> 00:40:26,939
Let me explain something!

480
00:40:26,940 --> 00:40:30,680
That what You speak happens when...

481
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,840
Do you understand?

482
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:43,579
"For God's Sake! What
kind of people are you?"

483
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,440
How is that not respect anything?

484
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:50,659
Oh, please!

485
00:40:50,660 --> 00:40:55,499
Don't worry, little one. We're
not going to let your dad die.

486
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:59,219
Generates, why their men don't sell
us your blood? We would pay for it.

487
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:02,299
Our guys can enter in combat at any time...

488
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:04,619
and need all your strength.
You, the white hat,

489
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:08,120
That you, a relative of him, come with me!

490
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,040
<-O->-¡Moveos, boys! <-O->-Yes, sir.

491
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:20,699
Back, there are a seriously wounded
person who is bleeding from the head.

492
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:24,819
If you do not want to go to play at the Casino in
Heaven, you must receive blood from a good american.

493
00:41:24,820 --> 00:41:26,779
<-O->-What I have understood?
<-O->-Yes, sir.

494
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:31,920
<-O->-I command you that ye should go and
you do a blood transfusion. -Yes, sir.

495
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:41,219
And now, let's go to the grain.
<-O->-But, general,

496
00:41:41,220 --> 00:41:43,859
<-O->- ... don't think it should go back...
<-O->-Let you Rest!

497
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:45,699
Let's look at the situation as I see it.

498
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:48,899
A man like me has no time for
speeches or pretty words.

499
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:53,360
What I have to say, only I'll say it
once and will listen to me carefully.

500
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:59,000
I never had time to lead an
easy life do you understand Me?

501
00:41:59,340 --> 00:42:02,739
Most of us have not had anything
of "dolce" in our "vita".

502
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,480
And what can I do?

503
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:08,240
- I would like that...
- Yes.

504
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,920
I Desnúdate!

505
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,179
But, in general, that respects
the range that has...

506
00:42:15,180 --> 00:42:18,779
Let's stop the blather! What
I need now is not respect.

507
00:42:18,780 --> 00:42:22,499
<-O->-I Am asking for something more.
<-O->-I see that you must feel very alone.

508
00:42:22,500 --> 00:42:25,659
This has nothing to do with the loneliness!

509
00:42:25,660 --> 00:42:27,219
A man can not be only,

510
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:32,299
when you live surrounded by
24 soldiers, day and night.

511
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:34,579
I have been in this appliance.

512
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:37,059
Oh God, six years ago!

513
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:41,499
Six years moving from one side to the
other, on the belly of this monster,

514
00:42:41,500 --> 00:42:45,219
spent among the enemy,
in search of some big fish.

515
00:42:45,220 --> 00:42:48,619
It six years no movies,
no outings, no shows!

516
00:42:48,620 --> 00:42:52,259
<-O->-Oh, Six years without a single woman!
<-O->-That is a record!

517
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,979
That's why, now, I ask you,

518
00:42:53,980 --> 00:42:57,379
in the name of the most sacred
that there is in the free world;

519
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,939
In the name of all those,

520
00:42:58,940 --> 00:43:03,600
that support this pernicious
wave of totalitarianism;

521
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,099
On behalf of those of us who are
standing, with your back on the wall...

522
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:10,880
and his fingers full of grease:

523
00:43:12,020 --> 00:43:14,120
I ask of you,

524
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:17,040
that if you love your country,

525
00:43:18,460 --> 00:43:21,659
I let you take a look.

526
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:25,360
It makes Me feel proud to be american!

527
00:43:41,420 --> 00:43:44,179
But, general, You said that
you only wanted to look.

528
00:43:44,180 --> 00:43:47,120
Sometimes, a look is not enough.

529
00:43:54,180 --> 00:43:56,360
Get set!

530
00:44:02,420 --> 00:44:03,619
What is it that you want?

531
00:44:03,620 --> 00:44:06,299
I want to have a son of yours!

532
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,640
I want to have a child!

533
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:19,179
I will be strong, loyal, and blonde!

534
00:44:19,180 --> 00:44:21,760
It will be like the two of us!

535
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:25,560
I will take a uniform like his father!

536
00:44:25,860 --> 00:44:28,099
I will show you the manual of the soldier.

537
00:44:28,100 --> 00:44:29,699
Will go to the Military School.

538
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,939
On the way, small! Is on the way!

539
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,059
You will learn what is freedom.

540
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:37,099
I will teach you to be a man of truth,

541
00:44:37,100 --> 00:44:40,299
not a child's weeping,

542
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:44,680
or one of those pacifists of the fourth.

543
00:44:44,740 --> 00:44:47,520
It will know be upright,

544
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:50,960
feet and with the chest lifted!

545
00:44:58,620 --> 00:45:03,899
Oh, it's horrible to see you leave all these
handsome young men with their bayonets!

546
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,939
I retreat strategic!

547
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:08,600
Don retaliation massive!

548
00:45:19,180 --> 00:45:21,800
It truly, war is hellish!

549
00:45:25,140 --> 00:45:27,779
Where have it gone? Where are they?

550
00:45:27,780 --> 00:45:31,219
Oh my god, they have gone without me!

551
00:45:31,220 --> 00:45:33,659
If you hurry, you can catch them.

552
00:45:33,660 --> 00:45:35,299
I Esperadme, boys!

553
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,419
I can't get in on the action without me!

554
00:45:37,420 --> 00:45:39,259
I Esperadme, boys!

555
00:45:39,260 --> 00:45:42,760
I wait for dad!

556
00:45:52,860 --> 00:45:56,720
Please, you can call for an
ambulance, when we land!

557
00:46:20,260 --> 00:46:24,499
PRESENTED TO THE DR. A. B. Krankheit.

558
00:46:24,500 --> 00:46:28,379
OPERATING OBLONGOTONOMIA THE PATIENT T.
M. CHRISTIAN

559
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:31,640
THIS EVENING AT EIGHT AND A HALF.
DEPLETED LOCALITIES.

560
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:13,939
You can be well proud of, Candy.

561
00:47:13,940 --> 00:47:15,899
What amount of public to view your old!

562
00:47:15,900 --> 00:47:19,899
New yorkers richest, most
respectable and most depraved...

563
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,240
are here, this evening.

564
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:02,779
Don't worry, sweetheart. If something happened,
provided you could live with your uncle.

565
00:48:02,780 --> 00:48:04,659
Yes, you could teach it all!

566
00:48:04,660 --> 00:48:06,699
What you mean if something happened?

567
00:48:06,700 --> 00:48:08,779
"Well, you have to be realistic!"

568
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,459
Nobody wants to see your father more
than I, Would give my right arm for him.

569
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:13,739
You're right-handed!

570
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:17,099
But, going with the grain.
What I'm trying to say is...

571
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:20,419
that I am sure that
everything will turn out fine.

572
00:48:20,420 --> 00:48:22,419
But, if not,

573
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:23,819
you know, such is life.

574
00:48:23,820 --> 00:48:26,720
How can you say that?

575
00:48:26,820 --> 00:48:31,659
Well, whatever happens, there is
to go on living... and loving.

576
00:48:31,660 --> 00:48:34,899
Dr. Krankheit is the best surgeon
in the world, in their specialty;

577
00:48:34,900 --> 00:48:36,459
But even he can make mistakes.

578
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:38,259
To say that da bad luck.

579
00:48:38,260 --> 00:48:40,600
Only to the patient.

580
00:50:10,620 --> 00:50:16,539
The patient suffers from a severe and massive
displacement of its nodes intracorticales.

581
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,459
There is a considerable
risk of lock-glandular.

582
00:50:20,460 --> 00:50:24,379
Hopefully successfully
overcome that risk particular.

583
00:50:24,380 --> 00:50:29,299
But we have to be very careful in
avoiding more serious injuries...

584
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,200
in the phase post-op
because of the lymphococcus.

585
00:50:34,260 --> 00:50:40,400
As you know You, well, that could end up
degenerating in the syndrome of Rathner,

586
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:43,539
in which case the
patient continues to live,

587
00:50:43,540 --> 00:50:47,760
be able to use almost
completely your muscular system.

588
00:50:47,780 --> 00:50:50,179
But your mental capacity will be reduced...

589
00:50:50,180 --> 00:50:53,360
that you can have a
cretin of middle age.

590
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:01,640
All of this offers us a range
of interesting possibilities.

591
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:04,900
A:

592
00:51:05,380 --> 00:51:09,000
We could make the traditional
and classical fusion,

593
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:11,659
by removing two-thirds of the skull...

594
00:51:11,660 --> 00:51:16,259
and exposing the patient's
brain to a strong level of D. A.

595
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,240
Waste atmospheric.

596
00:51:18,500 --> 00:51:22,840
Two. We could atravesarle
carefully a shoulder blade,

597
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:26,459
following the technique developed
by Brett Sullivan and John Hawkins,

598
00:51:26,460 --> 00:51:31,240
in their experiments
with monkeys of Papua.

599
00:51:33,620 --> 00:51:35,840
But, let's be realistic:

600
00:51:36,780 --> 00:51:42,040
We will operate a human
being, not a monkey of Papua.

601
00:51:43,020 --> 00:51:45,419
If there is someone here
who is not in agreement,

602
00:51:45,420 --> 00:51:50,440
with this technique, you
get out of here, immediately!

603
00:51:50,660 --> 00:51:52,480
Good!

604
00:51:54,300 --> 00:51:56,200
Let's start!

605
00:51:56,380 --> 00:52:00,160
What are we going to do exactly?

606
00:52:01,180 --> 00:52:02,699
What Dr. Harris?

607
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:07,259
I would start by making
an incision in the brain.

608
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,179
What is now going to get
to say stupid things?

609
00:52:09,180 --> 00:52:11,099
I just wanted to suggest that...

610
00:52:11,100 --> 00:52:12,459
You'll be in lectures redundant!

611
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:14,899
It seems to Me that this
operation must be...

612
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,019
You'll be nonsense, Harris!

613
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:21,520
I'm going to tell you exactly
what we're not going to do.

614
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:28,219
We're not going to use the old methods
are already very experienced.

615
00:52:28,220 --> 00:52:31,640
Not at all, that's what
we're going to take out...

616
00:52:36,620 --> 00:52:39,040
and throw it!

617
00:53:47,980 --> 00:53:49,579
You have to do it again!

618
00:53:49,580 --> 00:53:52,059
It's a human being...

619
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:55,080
and not from a method of literacy!

620
00:54:10,280 --> 00:54:12,559
I'm going to give still one
more minute to achieve this.

621
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:14,779
Oh my blessed, look at what it does!

622
00:54:14,780 --> 00:54:17,840
O you are a surgeon, not a gynecologist!

623
00:54:20,220 --> 00:54:22,480
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

624
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:25,320
we're going to get to the end!

625
00:55:37,900 --> 00:55:40,840
No, Bullock, not now!

626
00:55:41,900 --> 00:55:45,240
Ladies and gentlemen, the
occlusion has disappeared.

627
00:55:46,300 --> 00:55:48,920
My left index finger...

628
00:55:49,020 --> 00:55:54,680
has managed to slip seven centimeters,
inside the head of the patient.

629
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:58,579
With a single slight movement, could
erase twenty years of memories,

630
00:55:58,580 --> 00:56:01,680
as easily as you erase a whiteboard.

631
00:56:02,300 --> 00:56:05,579
Only that he now had the hiccups,

632
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:10,539
could return to the patient is not
only unable to pronounce the letters:

633
00:56:10,540 --> 00:56:13,979
L, R, D, y or F,

634
00:56:13,980 --> 00:56:18,960
but also make you unable
to dial any phone number.

635
00:56:19,740 --> 00:56:24,200
But, that's not going to happen,

636
00:56:24,460 --> 00:56:26,419
because...

637
00:56:26,420 --> 00:56:30,379
I know precisely...

638
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,800
what is there to do.

639
00:56:40,700 --> 00:56:43,200
I carried you to your room!

640
00:57:22,780 --> 00:57:27,840
I forgive you! Do you know where
I could find Dr. Krankheit?

641
00:57:32,620 --> 00:57:35,240
<-O->-I Would like to know...?
<-O->-Close door!

642
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:41,899
Could you help me?

643
00:57:41,900 --> 00:57:45,019
<-O->-How To Help You? -I'm looking for the Dr. Krankheit.
- What?

644
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:47,179
Do you know where I might find him?

645
00:57:47,180 --> 00:57:49,400
Be careful!

646
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:56,699
<-O->-Can anyone help me? <-O->-Mom!

647
00:57:56,700 --> 00:57:59,040
I'm looking for the Dr. Krankheit.

648
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:18,699
I want to leave you in peace!

649
00:58:18,700 --> 00:58:20,459
Who?

650
00:58:20,460 --> 00:58:22,299
Dr. Krankheit. Oh precisely, he!

651
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,000
Why?

652
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,299
Because I am his mom.

653
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:28,779
What is You Ms Krankheit?

654
00:58:28,780 --> 00:58:32,459
<-O->-Krankheit, not. Fingolini.
<-O->-Let Fingolini!

655
00:58:32,460 --> 00:58:36,059
Abraham Krankheit is
actually Mario Fingolini.

656
00:58:36,060 --> 00:58:37,739
I changed her last name.

657
00:58:37,740 --> 00:58:41,499
Because a doctor rich of New
York may not be an immigrant.

658
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,539
That is why, not to mention
that he is target in trouble

659
00:58:44,540 --> 00:58:47,499
with a girl who is called Christian.

660
00:58:47,500 --> 00:58:49,099
If you again see you here,

661
00:58:49,100 --> 00:58:51,179
sneaking around him,

662
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,080
I will take this brush and...

663
00:58:58,540 --> 00:59:02,379
This hospital is full of very sick people.

664
00:59:02,380 --> 00:59:03,499
What you said?

665
00:59:03,500 --> 00:59:04,779
He said that...

666
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:07,259
It doesn't matter. You've heard it before.

667
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:08,939
You said "sick".

668
00:59:08,940 --> 00:59:09,999
But I...

669
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:12,319
I don't give a damn what you wanted to say.
This people...

670
00:59:12,320 --> 00:59:14,139
also has feelings
like any human being...

671
00:59:14,140 --> 00:59:16,859
and not have to endure
your aires of superiority.

672
00:59:16,860 --> 00:59:19,600
I just wanted to find Dr. Krankheit.

673
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:21,019
Oh! What for?

674
00:59:21,020 --> 00:59:24,459
<-O->-To ask a question. <-O->-If,
that is not what I doubt.

675
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,299
But, listen to me, lady
of the eyes so vivid!

676
00:59:26,300 --> 00:59:28,619
I am the personal nurse of Dr. Krankheit.

677
00:59:28,620 --> 00:59:29,739
¡Personal!

678
00:59:29,740 --> 00:59:32,139
Bullock, here Krankheit.

679
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:35,400
I Want you to come immediately! Come on!

680
00:59:36,540 --> 00:59:38,840
She wants me to go!

681
01:00:03,580 --> 01:00:06,379
Oh Candy, you always manage to maximum fun!

682
01:00:06,380 --> 01:00:11,040
It's the best reception post-operative
that has never attended.

683
01:00:11,740 --> 01:00:15,560
Here it is! It is he of whom I have spoken.

684
01:00:22,540 --> 01:00:25,499
<-O->-Not to touch you. <-O->-The
doctor has said that we will not touch.

685
01:00:25,500 --> 01:00:29,019
Do not forget that our hands are
full of germs and micro-organisms,

686
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:32,539
spirochetes and who knows how
many other forms of infection.

687
01:00:32,540 --> 01:00:35,819
<-O->-I Just want you to know that I'm here.
- He knows it.

688
01:00:35,820 --> 01:00:38,000
How can you say that?

689
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,520
How can I tell that?

690
01:00:41,340 --> 01:00:44,859
He asks Me how I can say that.

691
01:00:44,860 --> 01:00:46,459
Put those flowers in ice.

692
01:00:46,460 --> 01:00:50,699
He knows because he is a doctor, tontita!

693
01:00:50,700 --> 01:00:52,699
Do you think that will be ok?

694
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:55,019
Look at it this way:

695
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,079
Your father will live.

696
01:00:56,080 --> 01:00:57,819
Oh, thank God!

697
01:00:57,820 --> 01:01:00,339
<-O->-The question is: For how long?
—You mean...

698
01:01:00,340 --> 01:01:03,139
I don't want to say anything!

699
01:01:03,140 --> 01:01:05,819
You should know that,
scientifically speaking,

700
01:01:05,820 --> 01:01:08,419
the only difference
between life and death...

701
01:01:08,420 --> 01:01:12,280
is that death lasts much longer.

702
01:01:14,620 --> 01:01:16,519
Just look this! Don Max
has brought his radio!

703
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:21,740
- Oh, Yes, let's dance a little!
- I have to find where to plug this.

704
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:27,419
Do you suffer any pain?

705
01:01:27,420 --> 01:01:30,680
That is an interesting question.

706
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:33,419
Let me try to contestársela.

707
01:01:33,420 --> 01:01:37,320
The pain is very difficult to measure.
For example...

708
01:01:38,540 --> 01:01:39,899
What have you done?

709
01:01:39,900 --> 01:01:41,619
You have been hurt, right?

710
01:01:41,620 --> 01:01:46,019
- Yes of course.
- How much? <-O->-I don't know.

711
01:01:46,020 --> 01:01:47,859
<-O->-Do More than a punch? <-O->-Yes.

712
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:52,539
But not as much as being run
over by the wheels of a truck.

713
01:01:52,540 --> 01:01:54,659
Of course not.

714
01:01:54,660 --> 01:01:59,779
Well, that will give you an idea of how
to measure the pain of his father.

715
01:01:59,780 --> 01:02:03,680
<-O->-Let Me explain something!
<-O->-What is that?

716
01:02:04,020 --> 01:02:07,219
It is one of my personal findings.

717
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:10,059
A tremendous progress in the
field of neuroencefalografía.

718
01:02:10,060 --> 01:02:15,219
I've called electrodegenerador
subcutaneous Krankheit.

719
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:18,899
The patient's brain is a
storehouse of energy.

720
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:23,299
We implemented a small plug
in your cranial cavity.

721
01:02:23,300 --> 01:02:26,899
The plug connects here...

722
01:02:26,900 --> 01:02:31,760
and so we eliminate the
excess of electrical energy.

723
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:37,259
Without this safety circuit, his father
would have a serious short circuit.

724
01:02:37,260 --> 01:02:41,520
In popular parlance: "you
will melt the leads".

725
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,200
But,

726
01:02:44,740 --> 01:02:47,520
this will not happen.

727
01:02:59,100 --> 01:03:04,240
Oh honey, come and dance with your uncle!

728
01:03:04,580 --> 01:03:07,440
Wait just a moment! Wait just a moment!

729
01:03:08,020 --> 01:03:10,880
What's wrong with you?
Don't you like the party?

730
01:03:17,500 --> 01:03:22,960
I sit here, near your father!

731
01:03:23,940 --> 01:03:26,760
I Muévele a bit!

732
01:03:34,340 --> 01:03:36,760
It is very comfortable,

733
01:03:37,100 --> 01:03:39,219
and family,

734
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:41,459
lying one next to the other.

735
01:03:41,460 --> 01:03:43,019
So should be always!

736
01:03:43,020 --> 01:03:44,659
I'm so tired!

737
01:03:44,660 --> 01:03:49,179
Ah, I see! Why don't you
take off your shoes?

738
01:03:49,180 --> 01:03:53,560
Yes! Already is.

739
01:03:54,620 --> 01:03:59,040
Perhaps you would be better if
you loose a bit of the dress.

740
01:04:04,420 --> 01:04:07,880
And now we taparemos with this sheet.

741
01:04:10,580 --> 01:04:14,819
Now, you just have to put
your head on my shoulder...

742
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:17,120
and try to sleep a little.

743
01:04:21,140 --> 01:04:24,960
How much I wish that you were my daughter!

744
01:04:25,540 --> 01:04:28,939
I know how hard that can be sometimes life.

745
01:04:28,940 --> 01:04:33,600
Living with your father must not be easy.

746
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:38,539
But that will change with
the aunt Livia and me.

747
01:04:38,540 --> 01:04:42,320
We are a people with much less formal.

748
01:04:42,820 --> 01:04:47,560
We treat everything as if
it were something familiar.

749
01:04:47,620 --> 01:04:50,520
What is going on here?

750
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:59,099
I animals is what these are!
A gang of wild animals!

751
01:04:59,100 --> 01:05:03,139
Come on, if you spend all
your time carving up people!

752
01:05:03,140 --> 01:05:06,160
It is she who organizes all the scandals!

753
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:16,939
I hope, miss, you have a good reason...

754
01:05:16,940 --> 01:05:20,859
we're caught in the bed of a
patient in a critical state,

755
01:05:20,860 --> 01:05:25,179
with his body half-naked,
wiggling and writhing,

756
01:05:25,180 --> 01:05:28,299
under a passion so foolish as shameful.

757
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:31,379
I just wanted to sleep
for a while, next to...

758
01:05:31,380 --> 01:05:35,899
I'm at the front of this hospital.
I'm Dr. Calvin Dunlop,

759
01:05:35,900 --> 01:05:38,419
general manager of this establishment.

760
01:05:38,420 --> 01:05:41,899
And I think I should intervene,
when in one of my rooms,

761
01:05:41,900 --> 01:05:45,739
is conducted a shameful
and disgraceful orgy.

762
01:05:45,740 --> 01:05:47,979
Truly I say to you, that
there has been no orgy!

763
01:05:47,980 --> 01:05:50,099
Don't tell me!

764
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:52,459
I am a doctor and not a
psychologist of people upset...

765
01:05:52,460 --> 01:05:54,639
and I know to recognize
in an orgy, when I see it.

766
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:58,739
And also what are the
depravity and indecency.

767
01:05:58,740 --> 01:06:02,139
And even more, when you catch
someone "in flagrant delicto".

768
01:06:02,140 --> 01:06:03,979
I don't know what that means.

769
01:06:03,980 --> 01:06:06,219
It means that you must
leave here immediately.

770
01:06:06,220 --> 01:06:11,379
I don't want to see my hospital converted
into a brothel by people degenerate like You.

771
01:06:11,380 --> 01:06:14,459
For me, You are a pelandusca,

772
01:06:14,460 --> 01:06:18,520
a harlot, joins furcia, a...

773
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:22,440
a young girl.

774
01:06:25,340 --> 01:06:28,120
What are You doing, Dunlop?

775
01:06:30,060 --> 01:06:31,459
Why is it on the floor this girl?

776
01:06:31,460 --> 01:06:32,739
It has been dropped.

777
01:06:32,740 --> 01:06:35,960
Because of Newton's laws, right?

778
01:06:36,020 --> 01:06:40,259
I guess the psychotic abuse
that You usually exercise...

779
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:42,059
has nothing to do with it.

780
01:06:42,060 --> 01:06:44,819
You don't need to take as well, Krankheit.

781
01:06:44,820 --> 01:06:49,339
Let me remind you, doctor, that
this is a patient of mine...

782
01:06:49,340 --> 01:06:51,139
and this is your room...

783
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:53,859
and she is the daughter of my patient.
Do you understand it?

784
01:06:53,860 --> 01:06:56,240
It help me to lift it! Come on!

785
01:06:59,460 --> 01:07:02,000
It Bullock!

786
01:07:02,220 --> 01:07:06,720
Try to keep a little order in this room.

787
01:07:09,580 --> 01:07:13,779
Mr. Christian, just You out
of a operation very serious.

788
01:07:13,780 --> 01:07:16,680
I think that you are mistaken Mr.
Christian, miss!

789
01:07:16,740 --> 01:07:21,120
Let me or I hit him a kick on their parts!

790
01:07:32,740 --> 01:07:36,920
Good! Do you any suggestions, doctor?

791
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:39,859
It seems to be unconscious.

792
01:07:39,860 --> 01:07:41,939
That's a great diagnosis!

793
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:46,579
And now, how do you propose
You look to this situation?

794
01:07:46,580 --> 01:07:48,059
Can you think of something?

795
01:07:48,060 --> 01:07:51,240
<-O->-Is young and apparently
in good health. -Very well.

796
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:53,779
We are practicing physicians.

797
01:07:53,780 --> 01:07:55,259
Exactly.

798
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:57,019
I Examinémosla!

799
01:07:57,020 --> 01:07:59,880
Oh Behave, Dunlop!

800
01:08:00,780 --> 01:08:03,779
Why can't we examine it a little?

801
01:08:03,780 --> 01:08:05,920
It not going to know.

802
01:08:06,180 --> 01:08:08,739
He suggests that you return to your office,

803
01:08:08,740 --> 01:08:13,320
take a tranquilizer and
then take a cold water bath.

804
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:18,699
I have not examined any patient.

805
01:08:18,700 --> 01:08:22,040
Good night, Mr. Manager.

806
01:08:23,220 --> 01:08:26,680
Good night to you, kind Mr. Prevaricador.

807
01:08:26,860 --> 01:08:29,179
I have happy dreams, Mr. Wallet!

808
01:08:29,180 --> 01:08:32,059
And You the same, Mr. Cazamoscas.

809
01:08:32,060 --> 01:08:34,019
Thank You, Mr. Sacadineros.

810
01:08:34,020 --> 01:08:36,819
Nothing, Mr. Bloodsuckers.

811
01:08:36,820 --> 01:08:39,979
There is what, Mr. Gains.

812
01:08:39,980 --> 01:08:43,259
Very well, Mr. Mammon.

813
01:08:43,260 --> 01:08:46,640
I Jódase, Sr. Merdoso!

814
01:08:49,140 --> 01:08:52,360
<-O->-I must have fainted. <-O->-Yes.

815
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:58,200
And I have to find the cause of
your fainting. It stand, please!

816
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:04,480
Fainting is a notice of our
nature that we must control.

817
01:09:04,660 --> 01:09:07,040
I breathe!

818
01:09:09,020 --> 01:09:12,000
Give yourself the back, please!

819
01:09:14,900 --> 01:09:16,499
Yes.

820
01:09:16,500 --> 01:09:21,640
All of this could be the symptom
of a dangerous disease.

821
01:09:22,220 --> 01:09:25,160
<-O->-Let's Take off the clothes!
<-O->-What?

822
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:27,859
Oh the clothes! ¡To remove clothing!

823
01:09:27,860 --> 01:09:30,339
Do not understand what I was saying.
I have to examine you.

824
01:09:30,340 --> 01:09:31,979
But if there is nothing wrong with me.

825
01:09:31,980 --> 01:09:34,720
It is not You who has to say it.

826
01:09:35,180 --> 01:09:38,339
You are just a kid that has
not gone even to College...

827
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:42,019
and your Coefficient of Intelligence,
sure that is not that of a genius.

828
01:09:42,020 --> 01:09:44,379
And, however, dares to
discuss the diagnosis...

829
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:48,819
of a surgeon renowned with many
titles as for wallpapering the walls.

830
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,419
Well...

831
01:09:50,420 --> 01:09:52,320
Is well.

832
01:09:52,340 --> 01:09:55,120
Of course that is fine!

833
01:10:02,540 --> 01:10:05,699
<-O->-When we did the last?
<-O->-a month Ago, in College.

834
01:10:05,700 --> 01:10:07,539
I mean to have a medical examination.

835
01:10:07,540 --> 01:10:09,099
Yes.

836
01:10:09,100 --> 01:10:12,760
<-O->-What You said that You had
a deviation of the spine? -No.

837
01:10:13,300 --> 01:10:15,680
Then, he was only a charlatan.

838
01:10:18,900 --> 01:10:21,099
Without a proper treatment,
when you turn 42 years old

839
01:10:21,100 --> 01:10:24,800
your body will look
like a bag of clothes.

840
01:10:25,380 --> 01:10:29,360
Now, take the back!

841
01:10:34,820 --> 01:10:38,840
Go bowing slowly!

842
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:41,699
Because I'll tell you
when you have to say: Oh!

843
01:10:41,700 --> 01:10:45,019
<-O->-But, doctor. Are you sure
that, You know...? -Slowly.

844
01:10:45,020 --> 01:10:49,059
<-O->-O Slowly! <-O->-But, Dr. Krankheit...

845
01:10:49,060 --> 01:10:50,739
Wow, this has to end already!

846
01:10:50,740 --> 01:10:54,480
Let's go, follow pitch! You should
have a little more humanity.

847
01:10:59,980 --> 01:11:02,019
"This is not the patient!"

848
01:11:02,020 --> 01:11:05,259
Of course not, you idiot!
It is his brother.

849
01:11:05,260 --> 01:11:08,640
If not, I would not have lasted so long.

850
01:11:11,180 --> 01:11:14,160
Who has been to the patient?

851
01:11:22,780 --> 01:11:27,099
Don Bullock, many times I have to
tell you not to interrupt my queries!

852
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,819
If you interest...

853
01:11:28,820 --> 01:11:30,379
This query already are ja finish.

854
01:11:30,380 --> 01:11:32,459
Oh my god, she already has done it again!

855
01:11:32,460 --> 01:11:36,099
Oh dear, put a counter
up and we will be rich!

856
01:11:36,100 --> 01:11:39,979
Well, I don't know about you,
but I have much work to do.

857
01:11:39,980 --> 01:11:42,280
Let me pass, Bullock!

858
01:11:43,860 --> 01:11:45,579
Let me pass!

859
01:11:45,580 --> 01:11:48,899
And warn him to stop once
to follow me and spy on me,

860
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:51,280
whoever you are.

861
01:11:58,060 --> 01:12:00,040
¡Doctor!

862
01:12:00,300 --> 01:12:02,339
¡Espéreme! I have to talk with You.

863
01:12:02,340 --> 01:12:04,979
Don't lie. That's not
going to serve anything,

864
01:12:04,980 --> 01:12:06,099
Why would they lie?

865
01:12:06,100 --> 01:12:10,499
Oh listen to me! We know what you're
looking for and what are your intentions.

866
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:11,759
Because they all think that...

867
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:15,619
The doctor is not available, do you
understand? It is not available!

868
01:12:15,620 --> 01:12:18,219
So try to sell your
charms on the other hand,

869
01:12:18,220 --> 01:12:22,840
because the doctor has already
said what he had to say.

870
01:12:24,260 --> 01:12:26,040
And now,

871
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,459
¡come!

872
01:12:28,460 --> 01:12:31,480
You will not notice anything.

873
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,379
I guess you don't care about anything,

874
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:06,200
but during your medical examination, your sick
father has disappeared in the middle of the night.

875
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,360
Oh dad! Oh dad!

876
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,720
Oh ladies, show your charms!

877
01:13:31,860 --> 01:13:34,099
Hello, my dear!

878
01:13:34,100 --> 01:13:36,400
You will be the next.

879
01:13:37,820 --> 01:13:39,619
I Deténganla!

880
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,099
Oh stop that girl!

881
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:42,539
It Bullock!

882
01:13:42,540 --> 01:13:44,300
Oh stop that girl!

883
01:14:36,980 --> 01:14:39,640
A Coca Cola, please!

884
01:14:49,140 --> 01:14:51,419
I'm afraid that I don't have money.

885
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:52,979
What?

886
01:14:52,980 --> 01:14:54,459
I can't pay.

887
01:14:54,460 --> 01:14:56,160
Stop!

888
01:14:56,300 --> 01:14:59,499
Thank you. Oh my god,
all for just ten cents!

889
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:01,579
If you let me your address, I'll pay.

890
01:15:01,580 --> 01:15:04,139
Forget it! The Big Boss wants to see it.

891
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,579
Who is this Big Boss?

892
01:15:05,580 --> 01:15:09,419
Does The Big Boss? All of you know.
It is...

893
01:15:09,420 --> 01:15:11,760
the Great Chief. Come on in!

894
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:15,040
Well, to me I love to meet new people.

895
01:15:15,780 --> 01:15:17,819
This is the Big Boss.

896
01:15:17,820 --> 01:15:19,920
Delighted to meet you.

897
01:15:20,420 --> 01:15:23,299
<-O->-Hey! Be careful. <-O->-Let
us know what all you have.

898
01:15:23,300 --> 01:15:25,459
What is this doing?

899
01:15:25,460 --> 01:15:30,539
He has paid me a Coca Cola, but that
does not authorize him to take...

900
01:15:30,540 --> 01:15:31,619
these freedoms.

901
01:15:31,620 --> 01:15:34,379
Did you hear what that says? It freedoms!

902
01:15:34,380 --> 01:15:36,939
I'll show you what is taking liberties.

903
01:15:36,940 --> 01:15:41,459
No! Don't, for a moment! Just
because I'm not from here!

904
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:44,160
You should try behaving well.

905
01:15:44,460 --> 01:15:46,659
<-O->-What? -If not, you
can have a small accident.

906
01:15:46,660 --> 01:15:48,819
We're going to hammer a nail in the foot...

907
01:15:48,820 --> 01:15:51,739
and then we're going to
get burned a little hair.

908
01:15:51,740 --> 01:15:55,019
That is what happens here to the
girls who do not behave well.

909
01:15:55,020 --> 01:15:58,339
Oh my god! And they call
this the City of the Fun?

910
01:15:58,340 --> 01:16:00,840
¡Fantastic! That's it.

911
01:16:01,220 --> 01:16:02,980
It is perfect!

912
01:16:03,340 --> 01:16:05,139
Don't have any photos!

913
01:16:05,140 --> 01:16:09,920
Don't we want photos! Let's go down!

914
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:12,920
Great! Great!

915
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,459
I just shoot a door in the wall.

916
01:16:15,460 --> 01:16:18,840
And now, I'm going to look
at the door, on the wall.

917
01:16:19,020 --> 01:16:21,840
My eyes are going to see, one by one.

918
01:16:22,060 --> 01:16:23,699
The left eye...

919
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,939
and now the right.

920
01:16:24,940 --> 01:16:27,499
My mouth, my teeth,

921
01:16:27,500 --> 01:16:30,379
my gums, my lips and everything else.

922
01:16:30,380 --> 01:16:32,600
And my throat.

923
01:16:34,620 --> 01:16:37,299
- Oh, Excuse Me!
- And now, you! Just do it!

924
01:16:37,300 --> 01:16:39,859
<-O->-Do It! -To do what? <-O->-Again!

925
01:16:39,860 --> 01:16:42,040
¡Corten!

926
01:16:43,220 --> 01:16:45,659
What Is G3?
Yes. What does it mean?

927
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:48,099
I am, G3, G of the cube.

928
01:16:48,100 --> 01:16:50,539
G. G. G. Gian Giovanni Gemini.

929
01:16:50,540 --> 01:16:52,059
What is called You so?

930
01:16:52,060 --> 01:16:54,619
<-O->-Does it sounds familiar?
<-O->-I have Just come.

931
01:16:54,620 --> 01:16:56,979
<-O->-Have you Ever seen my movies?
<-O->-Well... Not.

932
01:16:56,980 --> 01:16:59,299
<-O->-Wait! I'm going to
shoot your answer. -No.

933
01:16:59,300 --> 01:17:01,019
<-O->-Again! <-O->-No.

934
01:17:01,020 --> 01:17:02,780
¡Corten!

935
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:06,619
I have filmed 112 people
saying the word "no".

936
01:17:06,620 --> 01:17:07,819
Why?

937
01:17:07,820 --> 01:17:10,179
Because this is all part of life,

938
01:17:10,180 --> 01:17:12,119
and part of being,
living and understanding.

939
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:14,140
Have you seen someone film this?

940
01:17:14,820 --> 01:17:17,120
No. 113.

941
01:17:17,420 --> 01:17:21,120
<-O->-Have you heard of "Campbell"?
<-O->-What? -Campbell.

942
01:17:21,140 --> 01:17:25,299
The I shot last year in both
color and black-and-white.

943
01:17:25,300 --> 01:17:27,739
Two hours of soup,

944
01:17:27,740 --> 01:17:31,339
beans, rice, lentils, and carrots.

945
01:17:31,340 --> 01:17:36,040
The essence and the spirit and
the intimate entity of the soup.

946
01:17:36,540 --> 01:17:38,379
Oh I already got it!

947
01:17:38,380 --> 01:17:40,419
Man going through a door.

948
01:17:40,420 --> 01:17:44,059
And now I'm going to take
care of You Come on in!

949
01:17:44,060 --> 01:17:47,240
<-O->-Where are we going?
<-O->-I have an idea.

950
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:52,179
I don't understand what it
is that you want it to do.

951
01:17:52,180 --> 01:17:54,939
I want you to be you! (TOILET)

952
01:17:54,940 --> 01:17:59,739
Listen! I want you to become part
of the great human experience.

953
01:17:59,740 --> 01:18:03,520
I baths, crowds, trombones, rubbish!

954
01:18:03,540 --> 01:18:05,339
Oh listen to me!

955
01:18:05,340 --> 01:18:08,979
I was looking for. You're
going to be my next film.

956
01:18:08,980 --> 01:18:11,859
Stay with me and you'll
be just as famous as...

957
01:18:11,860 --> 01:18:13,379
How is it called?

958
01:18:13,380 --> 01:18:15,859
<-O->-What About Elizabeth Taylor?
<-O->-Who? Oh, no!

959
01:18:15,860 --> 01:18:19,600
And now, let's start. <-O->-Action!

960
01:18:20,620 --> 01:18:23,339
But it is that I know
nothing of interpretation.

961
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:27,499
And the Grand Canyon either
and, however, all go to see it.

962
01:18:27,500 --> 01:18:29,059
Don't move!

963
01:18:29,060 --> 01:18:30,899
Fantastic!

964
01:18:30,900 --> 01:18:33,539
Girl sitting on the throne.

965
01:18:33,540 --> 01:18:39,120
And now I want to see all
the pores of your skin. So!

966
01:18:39,620 --> 01:18:42,120
That's it. Good!

967
01:18:44,860 --> 01:18:48,800
And now; Now I want to see your pupils.

968
01:18:49,580 --> 01:18:51,680
Where are they?

969
01:18:51,820 --> 01:18:54,579
Where are you, cretin?

970
01:18:54,580 --> 01:18:57,720
Beware! This with a type that has a camera.

971
01:19:00,460 --> 01:19:03,099
Just perfect! Just perfect!

972
01:19:03,100 --> 01:19:05,539
Now shot your arms and your legs!

973
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,760
It is everything that I needed. And now...

974
01:19:12,540 --> 01:19:13,819
How beautiful!

975
01:19:13,820 --> 01:19:15,920
And your sex!

976
01:19:17,060 --> 01:19:19,819
I would say that they are doing
something forbidden. What do we do?

977
01:19:19,820 --> 01:19:24,179
And now your face. Look at the front!

978
01:19:24,180 --> 01:19:28,760
<-O->-Don't move! <-O->-Do
something that is haraam or not?

979
01:19:29,460 --> 01:19:31,059
The door is closed!

980
01:19:31,060 --> 01:19:33,779
Get ready to intervene!

981
01:19:33,780 --> 01:19:36,259
Whatever you are doing, stop!

982
01:19:36,260 --> 01:19:38,819
<-O->-In the name of the law!
<-O->-oh, The thighs!

983
01:19:38,820 --> 01:19:40,139
Oh show me your thighs!

984
01:19:40,140 --> 01:19:46,200
<-O->-Is something forbidden. How
we broke down the door? -Yes.

985
01:19:52,500 --> 01:19:56,179
Perfect, two cops! Control immorality.

986
01:19:56,180 --> 01:19:59,160
I come near! I come near!

987
01:20:00,380 --> 01:20:02,099
"This is going to be your last plane, man!"

988
01:20:02,100 --> 01:20:04,000
What crime we accuse?

989
01:20:04,740 --> 01:20:07,480
Filming without authorization.

990
01:20:08,300 --> 01:20:11,299
Illegal employment in public toilets...

991
01:20:11,300 --> 01:20:13,339
and flooding is not controlled.

992
01:20:13,340 --> 01:20:15,360
Where is gone girl?

993
01:20:17,140 --> 01:20:19,639
Do you know that has happened
with the girl in the blue dress?

994
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:22,260
Who is that movie?

995
01:20:26,660 --> 01:20:29,400
Man fainting.

996
01:21:24,740 --> 01:21:27,499
<-O->-Do you Have money?
<-O->-No, I'm sorry.

997
01:21:27,500 --> 01:21:30,880
I'll play if you give me something.

998
01:21:35,260 --> 01:21:37,819
But it is that I do not
have anything to give her.

999
01:21:37,820 --> 01:21:40,499
<-O->-O give me your ropopompón!
<-O->-What?

1000
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:45,200
See. We will win some money
and then ropopompón.

1001
01:21:49,420 --> 01:21:52,939
<-O->-Don't you want to ropopompón?
<-O->-I Would like to put on a dress dry.

1002
01:21:52,940 --> 01:21:56,400
I will give it and then ropopompón.

1003
01:22:15,860 --> 01:22:16,939
Did not you come?

1004
01:22:16,940 --> 01:22:18,019
I don't know.

1005
01:22:18,020 --> 01:22:21,179
<-O->-What Is this? <-O->-No, not really.

1006
01:22:21,180 --> 01:22:23,920
It is always for this!

1007
01:22:27,700 --> 01:22:31,560
Oh poor man! Should not think that.

1008
01:22:48,020 --> 01:22:50,600
Is it here where you live?

1009
01:23:19,420 --> 01:23:22,419
I'm sure that the music
is one of your hobbies.

1010
01:23:22,420 --> 01:23:25,880
<-O->-Could you play something
for me, while I dry? -Yes.

1011
01:23:45,300 --> 01:23:48,320
Are you sure that you
know what you are doing?

1012
01:23:56,740 --> 01:23:59,440
You have an exquisite taste.

1013
01:24:50,180 --> 01:24:53,280
<-O->-Who is she? <-O->-Where are you?

1014
01:24:54,260 --> 01:24:56,459
<-O->-Where is the Boss?
<-O->-What is going on here?

1015
01:24:56,460 --> 01:24:59,720
<-O->-What kind of guardian are you?
<-O->-What is your mission?

1016
01:25:00,020 --> 01:25:02,579
Hello, chief! We bring it all.

1017
01:25:02,580 --> 01:25:05,320
Have reached their friends.

1018
01:25:39,660 --> 01:25:42,440
I can not understand you.

1019
01:25:42,700 --> 01:25:44,600
What do you want?

1020
01:25:46,420 --> 01:25:48,539
It shouldn't bite people,

1021
01:25:48,540 --> 01:25:50,179
is very ugly!

1022
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:52,640
And now, ropopompón!

1023
01:25:59,620 --> 01:26:01,179
Don't you think...

1024
01:26:01,180 --> 01:26:02,259
Do you not want to?

1025
01:26:02,260 --> 01:26:04,979
I appreciate your hospitality, but...

1026
01:26:04,980 --> 01:26:06,039
What is this?

1027
01:26:06,040 --> 01:26:09,580
<-O->-No, that has nothing to do with it.
<-O->-Yes.

1028
01:26:23,620 --> 01:26:27,379
<-O->-What Is this?
<-O->-oh, No, No, really!

1029
01:26:27,380 --> 01:26:31,720
Why? It is not nothing. It's
like having torticolis.

1030
01:26:32,140 --> 01:26:34,240
It's always so!

1031
01:26:36,020 --> 01:26:39,360
Oh, poor boy, you must not think that!

1032
01:27:37,540 --> 01:27:38,679
What is this?

1033
01:27:38,680 --> 01:27:42,100
I don't know that to do here,
but they seem to some panties.

1034
01:27:42,300 --> 01:27:45,219
Oh my god, is a 507!

1035
01:27:45,220 --> 01:27:48,280
Let us go to make
adjustment to the accounts!

1036
01:27:55,660 --> 01:27:58,000
Let no one move!

1037
01:28:01,220 --> 01:28:02,659
And what does this who it is?

1038
01:28:02,660 --> 01:28:04,259
We have won the lottery!

1039
01:28:04,260 --> 01:28:06,859
Is the visiting card of the little man.

1040
01:28:06,860 --> 01:28:11,600
<-O->-What little man? -The hunchback
most dangerous criminals of today.

1041
01:28:11,900 --> 01:28:16,560
You have three seconds to drop your
weapons and get out of that Steinway!

1042
01:28:43,780 --> 01:28:47,619
That is one of the old
tricks of the crosses-walls.

1043
01:28:47,620 --> 01:28:48,999
<-O->-We'll catch him! <-O->-Yes.

1044
01:28:49,000 --> 01:28:51,659
I had not told you how it was called.

1045
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:56,400
Go! If what I see, I hope
to be able to recognize it.

1046
01:29:00,860 --> 01:29:03,819
Let's see if I calmáis back there
or I'm going to give you a beating!

1047
01:29:03,820 --> 01:29:04,899
What do they do?

1048
01:29:04,900 --> 01:29:07,579
I don't know. But whatever
it is, should be illegal.

1049
01:29:07,580 --> 01:29:08,819
<-O->-Can I look at? <-O->-Not!

1050
01:29:08,820 --> 01:29:11,639
' Shut up and drive!
Are we going to the police Station? No.

1051
01:29:11,640 --> 01:29:13,659
I find me a nice site!

1052
01:29:13,660 --> 01:29:17,139
I want to get rid of these
nasties and get some pleasure!

1053
01:29:17,140 --> 01:29:18,979
But if we have not done anything wrong.

1054
01:29:18,980 --> 01:29:22,299
Listen, I don't know what is your game,

1055
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:25,979
or to engage You and your gang,

1056
01:29:25,980 --> 01:29:29,259
but I'm going to teach them
to re-tuck in my district!

1057
01:29:29,260 --> 01:29:31,779
But, if I had not seen nape
of the neck to that people!

1058
01:29:31,780 --> 01:29:33,619
Everything you say may be used against you.

1059
01:29:33,620 --> 01:29:36,880
<-O->-But if I don't... <-O->-against you.
I understand!

1060
01:29:37,260 --> 01:29:39,819
I would not mind to be against it.

1061
01:29:39,820 --> 01:29:41,960
You, watch where you're going!

1062
01:29:45,100 --> 01:29:46,259
Do you carry hidden weapons?

1063
01:29:46,260 --> 01:29:47,379
Of course not!

1064
01:29:47,380 --> 01:29:49,379
What drug? What pills?

1065
01:29:49,380 --> 01:29:51,899
<-O->-What About Amphetamines?
What marijuana? <-O->-Not!

1066
01:29:51,900 --> 01:29:56,259
Oh, that's not going to
serve you, small slut!

1067
01:29:56,260 --> 01:29:58,459
Put the hands in the back!

1068
01:29:58,460 --> 01:30:00,539
What are you going to make me?

1069
01:30:00,540 --> 01:30:03,139
We're going to register for, miss,

1070
01:30:03,140 --> 01:30:06,360
as you've never been before.

1071
01:30:08,300 --> 01:30:10,800
I record it, sergeant!

1072
01:30:11,300 --> 01:30:13,360
I score it!

1073
01:30:19,700 --> 01:30:25,299
And now we present, for your amusement,

1074
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:28,819
newcomer to any site, Ahmed,

1075
01:30:28,820 --> 01:30:31,040
the magician!

1076
01:31:04,060 --> 01:31:06,040
Let us run over!

1077
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:34,120
¡Gross polis!

1078
01:31:34,180 --> 01:31:35,960
O murderers of children!

1079
01:31:36,860 --> 01:31:38,139
¡Let's get out of here!

1080
01:31:38,140 --> 01:31:41,560
This is a nest of queers!

1081
01:31:42,780 --> 01:31:45,040
¡Fire at will!

1082
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:52,379
¡Monster fascist!

1083
01:31:52,380 --> 01:31:54,760
¿Bromeas? I'm irish.

1084
01:32:02,820 --> 01:32:05,960
Why not fighting like a man?

1085
01:32:06,940 --> 01:32:08,339
Do you want even more?

1086
01:32:08,340 --> 01:32:10,859
Yes, yes, hit me more,

1087
01:32:10,860 --> 01:32:13,320
putón of blue eyes!

1088
01:32:13,420 --> 01:32:15,200
Oh sergeant!

1089
01:32:15,340 --> 01:32:17,320
Oh sergeant!

1090
01:32:44,340 --> 01:32:47,840
I've broken the heel!

1091
01:33:12,180 --> 01:33:14,720
What I can bring?

1092
01:33:49,920 --> 01:33:53,879
Stop! You have to take your shoes off!

1093
01:33:53,880 --> 01:33:55,799
Oh, I'm sorry! I thought that maybe...

1094
01:33:55,800 --> 01:34:00,380
This sanctuary is well above this
material world. It is a sacred place.

1095
01:34:00,400 --> 01:34:05,119
The light, the walls, the water, and
these hands; Everything is sacred.

1096
01:34:05,120 --> 01:34:06,259
I've already seen!

1097
01:34:06,260 --> 01:34:10,279
<-O->-Oh, keep your shoes materials in the sacred water!
- And what do I do?

1098
01:34:10,280 --> 01:34:13,060
I throw them to the material world!

1099
01:34:13,520 --> 01:34:15,299
But if you are the only ones that I have!

1100
01:34:15,300 --> 01:34:17,359
I pull them!

1101
01:34:17,360 --> 01:34:19,740
Wait!

1102
01:34:22,960 --> 01:34:24,660
Wait!

1103
01:34:25,320 --> 01:34:28,519
Give me that material corruption!

1104
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:31,700
Out! Out!

1105
01:34:51,720 --> 01:34:55,559
Don't need them, or anything
else that is material!

1106
01:34:55,560 --> 01:35:01,300
You must strip yourself of everything
that is material. And let's go!

1107
01:35:06,800 --> 01:35:10,020
<-O->-What's your name? <-O->-Candy.

1108
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,279
What Candy? How do you write?

1109
01:35:12,280 --> 01:35:14,780
C-A-N-D-AND

1110
01:35:15,200 --> 01:35:19,199
Be careful! O tell me the truth!
Of Course, so I call. Wait!

1111
01:35:19,200 --> 01:35:22,239
Wait, don't repeat it! It is a sacred name.

1112
01:35:22,240 --> 01:35:24,199
A name that can not say.

1113
01:35:24,200 --> 01:35:25,839
I don't understand.

1114
01:35:25,840 --> 01:35:27,559
Listen!

1115
01:35:27,560 --> 01:35:30,959
C-A-N-D-Y. Five letters.

1116
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:33,159
Five, the magic number.

1117
01:35:33,160 --> 01:35:36,220
Five, the pentagram is sacred.

1118
01:35:36,360 --> 01:35:38,759
The first letter of your name is C.

1119
01:35:38,760 --> 01:35:43,740
C is the sign of the sierra
eagle, the sign of masculinity.

1120
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,999
The last letter of your name is the Y.

1121
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,359
The sign of the Yoni,

1122
01:35:49,360 --> 01:35:52,060
the dispenser of all good.

1123
01:35:52,200 --> 01:35:55,039
And in the middle AND (and).

1124
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:58,700
C and Y.

1125
01:35:59,560 --> 01:36:01,359
Do you understand, now?

1126
01:36:01,360 --> 01:36:02,799
I'm not sure. I...

1127
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:07,740
Wait, don't talk! Don't move!
I have more evidence.

1128
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:19,319
Oh, my God!

1129
01:36:19,320 --> 01:36:22,199
<-O->-I Thought... -what better,
you thought that hung in the air.

1130
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:23,940
So it would seem.

1131
01:36:24,720 --> 01:36:26,820
It is a plastic seat.

1132
01:36:26,880 --> 01:36:30,359
Appearances are always deceptive.

1133
01:36:30,360 --> 01:36:33,519
To float in the air is a trick very easy.

1134
01:36:33,520 --> 01:36:38,079
In my country, all this is only
used as a public entertainment.

1135
01:36:38,080 --> 01:36:42,959
Disappear by the end of a
rope, walk on hot coals,

1136
01:36:42,960 --> 01:36:47,340
play with poisonous snakes.
Are games only for children.

1137
01:36:47,520 --> 01:36:49,199
How can You do all of that?

1138
01:36:49,200 --> 01:36:53,439
My dear and innocent girl,
when I was nine years...

1139
01:36:53,440 --> 01:36:59,460
he could do things that are
incomprehensible to the western mentality.

1140
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:05,140
He lifted huge weights
only with the tongue.

1141
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:08,479
I could see, through seven layers of zinc.

1142
01:37:08,480 --> 01:37:11,599
And, it is not by vanagloriarme,

1143
01:37:11,600 --> 01:37:13,700
but,

1144
01:37:14,520 --> 01:37:18,279
until, until I could
speak with the vegetables.

1145
01:37:18,280 --> 01:37:20,519
Oh, that is wonderful!

1146
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:23,319
No, that is not nothing.

1147
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:28,919
Only a grain of sand, compared with the
mountains created by the gods in the past;

1148
01:37:28,920 --> 01:37:32,599
Compared to what you and I
are going to do together here.

1149
01:37:32,600 --> 01:37:33,719
Do together?

1150
01:37:33,720 --> 01:37:36,020
Yes, of course.

1151
01:37:36,240 --> 01:37:40,380
Together we will find the path of
selfishness; I say not-selfishness;

1152
01:37:41,440 --> 01:37:44,439
Beyond the valley of
the material concerns...

1153
01:37:44,440 --> 01:37:47,639
and the cliffs of the negative feelings,

1154
01:37:47,640 --> 01:37:50,879
clambering and fighting...

1155
01:37:50,880 --> 01:37:55,759
until we reach... the vacuum.
The vacuum!

1156
01:37:55,760 --> 01:37:59,799
Beyond time and space,

1157
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,799
beyond one's self,

1158
01:38:01,800 --> 01:38:03,980
the vacuum,

1159
01:38:04,360 --> 01:38:07,620
pure energy and light.

1160
01:38:07,760 --> 01:38:10,180
God!

1161
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:13,060
What god?

1162
01:38:13,320 --> 01:38:15,719
God has nothing to do Come!

1163
01:38:15,720 --> 01:38:17,919
Where do I start?

1164
01:38:17,920 --> 01:38:21,359
<-O->-First, I'm going to teach you to breathe.
- What?

1165
01:38:21,360 --> 01:38:26,900
As a typical american, you must believe
that you already know breathing.

1166
01:38:27,280 --> 01:38:31,639
But, let me tell you this. Only
know one mode of breathing.

1167
01:38:31,640 --> 01:38:36,199
<-O->-Inspire and breathe.
Do you deny it? -No.

1168
01:38:36,200 --> 01:38:40,279
But the truth is that there are
other thousand ways of breathing.

1169
01:38:40,280 --> 01:38:43,199
Forward and back; Up and down,

1170
01:38:43,200 --> 01:38:46,479
breathing like a camel
or like the grass.

1171
01:38:46,480 --> 01:38:49,300
Do you want to say, as the photosynthesis?

1172
01:38:49,720 --> 01:38:52,119
- What?
- Do you know, when the carbon...?

1173
01:38:52,120 --> 01:38:56,959
No, No. Forget about all that
and take it off of your mind.

1174
01:38:56,960 --> 01:38:59,799
Leaving aside the science,
that it is something corrupt.

1175
01:38:59,800 --> 01:39:03,039
I forget everything they
taught you in School!

1176
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:05,719
I forget the formulae and theorems,

1177
01:39:05,720 --> 01:39:09,559
of prefabricated houses
and of the gum of rubber,

1178
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:13,159
of the lacquer to the hair,
credit cards, Wall Street and...!

1179
01:39:13,160 --> 01:39:14,179
It cast!

1180
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:15,359
What does it say?

1181
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:19,060
It cast! We're going to start breathing.

1182
01:39:34,880 --> 01:39:38,940
<-O->-Oh, that is gorgeous! <-O->-Oh Cast!

1183
01:39:43,360 --> 01:39:44,439
Just wait a moment!

1184
01:39:44,440 --> 01:39:48,319
When I arrived a little while
ago it was day and now...

1185
01:39:48,320 --> 01:39:49,399
It's midnight!

1186
01:39:49,400 --> 01:39:51,119
What I have done?

1187
01:39:51,120 --> 01:39:56,180
To you, nothing. But at the time, a lot.

1188
01:39:58,440 --> 01:40:02,679
Now we have to find the
appropriate site. It cast!

1189
01:40:02,680 --> 01:40:06,279
<-O->-What we call the centre of all breathing.
- Are my lungs?

1190
01:40:06,280 --> 01:40:08,319
No, it is not so simple.

1191
01:40:08,320 --> 01:40:12,639
Is the site in which it is to be immutable.

1192
01:40:12,640 --> 01:40:14,740
We must seek it.

1193
01:40:15,000 --> 01:40:18,420
Let see! Will it be here?

1194
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,580
No, I don't think so.

1195
01:40:21,920 --> 01:40:24,260
Maybe, you should be here!

1196
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:27,180
No, I've gone back to being wrong!

1197
01:40:27,720 --> 01:40:29,980
Here?

1198
01:40:30,360 --> 01:40:32,580
No!

1199
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:39,359
<-O->-Or here? -No, I'm
sure that here is not.

1200
01:40:39,360 --> 01:40:40,999
I think yes.

1201
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,040
What we have found very fast.
It must be a good sign.

1202
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:48,379
<-O->-I Am sorry to take you the opposite, but...
- oh, throw yourself!

1203
01:40:48,380 --> 01:40:50,920
Who is the guru, here, you or me?

1204
01:41:01,400 --> 01:41:04,679
<-O->-Do More breathing? <-O->-No,
this is just the first level.

1205
01:41:04,680 --> 01:41:06,599
You must move forward, now.

1206
01:41:06,600 --> 01:41:08,519
How many levels we have to take?

1207
01:41:08,520 --> 01:41:12,039
Seven. The first is to be able to
feel the rhythm of the cosmos.

1208
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:13,279
I hear you, a moment!

1209
01:41:13,280 --> 01:41:15,199
Don't talk! We can't wait.

1210
01:41:15,200 --> 01:41:16,759
Oh my buttons!

1211
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,559
Your buttons, as you call them,

1212
01:41:18,560 --> 01:41:22,399
are not more than the reflection of
that self that you must leave behind you.

1213
01:41:22,400 --> 01:41:24,439
Don't mean anything and
are somewhat corrupt.

1214
01:41:24,440 --> 01:41:28,959
Without those buttons, you're
going to move on to levels 2, 3,

1215
01:41:28,960 --> 01:41:33,119
4, 5 and 6 and, finally...

1216
01:41:33,120 --> 01:41:37,039
to the last level. Good!

1217
01:41:37,040 --> 01:41:41,780
And now, let's get ready to
address the second level:

1218
01:41:41,920 --> 01:41:45,500
The body has no value.

1219
01:41:46,440 --> 01:41:49,380
It's not worth anything!

1220
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,980
It or this!

1221
01:41:55,400 --> 01:41:57,900
It or this!

1222
01:41:58,680 --> 01:42:00,980
It or this!

1223
01:42:02,760 --> 01:42:06,540
It or this! And now we
will pass to the level...

1224
01:42:08,360 --> 01:42:10,799
<-O->-To... <-O->-Do Two?

1225
01:42:10,800 --> 01:42:12,860
Two!

1226
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,079
Don't think I could breathe
so much more time.

1227
01:42:27,080 --> 01:42:31,679
So keep patience! The road is
hard, but worth the effort.

1228
01:42:31,680 --> 01:42:36,519
The escolopendra, in my country, it has
thousands of legs, but can't dance tap dancing.

1229
01:42:36,520 --> 01:42:38,839
I don't see that has to do that.

1230
01:42:38,840 --> 01:42:42,180
Well, you always lose
something when translated.

1231
01:42:56,320 --> 01:42:59,260
I wonder where we can be.

1232
01:42:59,840 --> 01:43:02,079
That does not matter.

1233
01:43:02,080 --> 01:43:03,679
The space is just an illusion.

1234
01:43:03,680 --> 01:43:06,439
It is curved in on itself
like an artichoke.

1235
01:43:06,440 --> 01:43:10,479
Oh, an artichoke, I would be very good!
I'm dying of hunger.

1236
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:12,799
What is that you can only think about it?

1237
01:43:12,800 --> 01:43:15,199
What in your body and in your poor desires?

1238
01:43:15,200 --> 01:43:18,119
I can not help it. I'm hungry.

1239
01:43:18,120 --> 01:43:21,900
We are traveling beyond
the thirst and hunger.

1240
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:29,780
It's like the legend of
the pig and the flower.

1241
01:43:38,600 --> 01:43:40,839
What is the legend of
the pig and the flower?

1242
01:43:40,840 --> 01:43:46,820
Is a legend that my people sing and dance.

1243
01:43:47,320 --> 01:43:49,660
A pig comes up to some bushes.

1244
01:43:51,000 --> 01:43:54,959
In the scrub sees a large
flower of violet color.

1245
01:43:54,960 --> 01:43:57,460
It is the only one in the surrounding area.

1246
01:43:58,120 --> 01:44:01,780
Then, the pig falls in
love with the flower.

1247
01:44:02,480 --> 01:44:07,359
The pig confesses his love
to the flower and she says:

1248
01:44:07,360 --> 01:44:12,340
"You're a pig and you're very
dirty, even to be a pig".

1249
01:44:13,440 --> 01:44:15,559
Then the pig starts to cry...

1250
01:44:15,560 --> 01:44:18,900
and the flower is pity, the
dirty animal, and he says:

1251
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:22,719
"I'll love you, when you get to be clean."

1252
01:44:22,720 --> 01:44:28,540
The radiant heart of joy, the pig
drops to wash herself at the river.

1253
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:32,460
It gets in the water...

1254
01:44:32,600 --> 01:44:35,380
and is devoured by a crocodile.

1255
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,580
What is the meaning of this story?

1256
01:44:42,920 --> 01:44:45,340
I have No idea.

1257
01:44:56,320 --> 01:44:58,799
What level are we now?

1258
01:44:58,800 --> 01:45:01,159
<-O->-In the third! <-O->-How is it called?

1259
01:45:01,160 --> 01:45:04,540
The level of positive non-being.

1260
01:45:04,560 --> 01:45:09,260
I can not grasp the difference
between one level and another.

1261
01:45:15,800 --> 01:45:18,719
It will be better for us to stop.

1262
01:45:18,720 --> 01:45:21,940
Look, snow!

1263
01:45:22,400 --> 01:45:26,279
If you don't mind, I would like
to now take a little rest.

1264
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:29,239
Look like stars floating in it.

1265
01:45:29,240 --> 01:45:32,519
<-O->-Look! Oh listen to me! <-O->-Is
There anything not going well?

1266
01:45:32,520 --> 01:45:34,900
It is not only that...

1267
01:45:35,480 --> 01:45:37,519
Depart!

1268
01:45:37,520 --> 01:45:39,319
You're going to resfriarte!

1269
01:45:39,320 --> 01:45:41,780
That is impossible.

1270
01:45:41,920 --> 01:45:46,399
The flesh does not mean anything
in the way of the realization.

1271
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:49,599
<-O->-We Live in the vortex.
<-O->-what is The vortex?

1272
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:51,679
It is the fifth level.

1273
01:45:51,680 --> 01:45:54,420
What has happened to the fourth level?

1274
01:45:55,240 --> 01:45:57,799
<-O->-I've jumped. <-O->-Can You do that?

1275
01:45:57,800 --> 01:46:02,820
Do not follow every one of the
levels in the way everlasting?

1276
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:07,020
Yes, but I am a mystic reformed.

1277
01:46:22,880 --> 01:46:24,660
Listen!

1278
01:46:26,080 --> 01:46:28,439
This can be something serious.

1279
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:30,900
Do you not have a thermometer?

1280
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:35,159
It seems that you have not learned
anything. Our bodies do not exist.

1281
01:46:35,160 --> 01:46:38,999
We are on the threshold of the last level.

1282
01:46:39,000 --> 01:46:43,679
The injection of the universal spirit.

1283
01:46:43,680 --> 01:46:45,919
But if that is the level 6!

1284
01:46:45,920 --> 01:46:49,620
What happens in the ♪ 7?
And what about the vacuum?

1285
01:46:51,560 --> 01:46:54,679
I don't I can carry to
the edge of the void.

1286
01:46:54,680 --> 01:46:57,879
A teacher wiser than I...

1287
01:46:57,880 --> 01:47:00,799
will lead to the end of the trip.

1288
01:47:00,800 --> 01:47:02,439
How will I recognize you?

1289
01:47:02,440 --> 01:47:03,799
By the sacred bird.

1290
01:47:03,800 --> 01:47:06,020
What is the holy bird?

1291
01:47:06,800 --> 01:47:11,140
<-O->-No matter what.
<-O->-Hey, the door is open!

1292
01:48:26,920 --> 01:48:29,540
The police!

1293
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,799
Take a look back; I'm going
to talk with the driver.

1294
01:48:37,800 --> 01:48:42,279
<-O->-Do you take fruits, flowers,
plants, weapons, or alcohol? -A guru.

1295
01:48:42,280 --> 01:48:46,380
What?
A guru. Is that a fruit or a plant?

1296
01:48:47,080 --> 01:48:52,540
Hey, George! What is prohibited to
import of gurus frozen in California?

1297
01:50:03,200 --> 01:50:05,820
Oh Charlie, get me out of here!
Do you want to?

1298
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:10,719
<-O->-Oh, Charlie!
- You're well? <-O->-I've lost all my pocket change.

1299
01:50:10,720 --> 01:50:12,700
Let me out of in here!

1300
01:50:34,760 --> 01:50:37,780
The sacred bird!

1301
01:51:52,720 --> 01:51:56,700
Is it You who will lead me to the vacuum?

1302
01:53:52,160 --> 01:53:54,260
Have we arrived already?

1303
01:53:57,000 --> 01:54:00,180
Say that You are able to...

1304
01:54:01,200 --> 01:54:03,060
give me the answer?

1305
01:54:04,200 --> 01:54:06,500
I don't understand...

1306
01:54:08,600 --> 01:54:11,220
which means all of this!

1307
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:39,020
The statue is coming towards us!

1308
01:55:05,480 --> 01:55:06,759
What has happened?

1309
01:55:06,760 --> 01:55:09,540
What are we going to do now?

1310
01:55:17,520 --> 01:55:20,580
Are you not going to tell me your name?

1311
01:55:47,520 --> 01:55:50,060
Oh my god!

1312
01:55:51,600 --> 01:55:54,220
It is dad!

1313
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:57,900
Oh dad!

1314
02:04:01,900 --> 02:04:03,600
Vtg
