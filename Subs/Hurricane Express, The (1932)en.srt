1
00:02:15,814 --> 00:02:18,469
Well, dad, I got
you here on time.

2
00:02:18,513 --> 00:02:20,950
There's your pride and joy
just coming off the turntable.

3
00:02:20,993 --> 00:02:22,734
Yes sirree, the old
Hurricane Express.

4
00:02:28,392 --> 00:02:30,264
Hold on, Steve,
I'll take her down.

5
00:02:39,838 --> 00:02:42,058
Sure jealous of
this old boiler, dad.

6
00:02:42,102 --> 00:02:43,581
Why shouldn't I be?

7
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:45,453
Why, boy, she's part of me.

8
00:02:45,496 --> 00:02:48,978
Or maybe I'm just part
of her, I don't know.

9
00:02:49,021 --> 00:02:52,938
I took her out on her first run.

10
00:02:52,982 --> 00:02:58,770
And I hope I'll be at her
throttle when I make my last.

11
00:02:58,814 --> 00:03:01,730
Too bad the old
heap's out of date.

12
00:03:01,773 --> 00:03:03,340
What do you mean, out of date?

13
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,299
You're talking about
the Hurricane Express,

14
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:06,909
the fastest train
in the country—

15
00:03:06,952 --> 00:03:08,606
the fastest train
in any country.

16
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:09,390
Out of date?

17
00:03:11,218 --> 00:03:12,697
Well, I wouldn't complain.

18
00:03:19,791 --> 00:03:20,618
Them playthings?

19
00:03:22,968 --> 00:03:25,362
The Hurricane Express
gets you there on time.

20
00:03:25,406 --> 00:03:27,451
She's safe and she's sure.

21
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,064
OK, dad.

22
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:34,371
You stick to your engine
and I'll stick to my plane.

23
00:03:34,415 --> 00:03:38,636
And I'll beat you to Springfield
by three hours, as usual.

24
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,724
Oh, yeah?

25
00:03:39,768 --> 00:03:40,986
Yeah.

26
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,553
If you hauled as
many packages as I do,

27
00:03:42,597 --> 00:03:44,425
you wouldn't land them
in a week and a half.

28
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:45,861
You win, dad.

29
00:03:45,904 --> 00:03:48,124
Don't let your wheels get rusty.

30
00:04:11,669 --> 00:04:12,975
Hi, James.

31
00:04:13,018 --> 00:04:14,716
It's all tuned up,
Larry, and raring to go.

32
00:04:14,759 --> 00:04:15,847
Well, so am I.

33
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:23,812
Gloria?

34
00:04:23,855 --> 00:04:25,248
This is a surprise.

35
00:04:25,292 --> 00:04:27,250
What are you doing
in the enemy's line?

36
00:04:28,599 --> 00:04:29,948
I'm going to be a
passenger on your plane.

37
00:04:29,992 --> 00:04:31,254
Gee, that's great.

38
00:04:31,298 --> 00:04:33,300
But what a story for
the scandal sheets.

39
00:04:33,343 --> 00:04:36,433
"Miss Gloria Martin, Secretary
to the Railroad General Manager

40
00:04:36,477 --> 00:04:39,001
Does Her Traveling by Air".

41
00:04:39,044 --> 00:04:40,959
Well, this is a
special occasion.

42
00:04:41,003 --> 00:04:43,048
I'm not going to
make a habit of it.

43
00:04:43,092 --> 00:04:43,919
I wish you would.

44
00:04:51,274 --> 00:04:52,449
Anyway, I'll get a big
thrill out of seeing

45
00:04:52,493 --> 00:04:54,059
our railroad from the air.

46
00:04:54,103 --> 00:04:58,586
Well, well, Gloria, this
is an unexpected pleasure.

47
00:04:58,629 --> 00:04:59,804
How are you, Mr. Grey?

48
00:04:59,848 --> 00:05:01,415
Fine, thank you.

49
00:05:01,458 --> 00:05:03,373
Isn't it time you were
getting ready, Baker?

50
00:05:03,417 --> 00:05:04,809
Why?

51
00:05:04,853 --> 00:05:07,029
Aren't pilots allowed
to talk to passengers?

52
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:08,596
Well, sometimes.

53
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,338
But not when the manager
wants to talk to her himself.

54
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,077
Oh.

55
00:05:15,429 --> 00:05:16,517
I'll see you later, Gloria.

56
00:05:19,433 --> 00:05:23,959
I'm glad to see you're
getting air-minded at last.

57
00:05:24,002 --> 00:05:25,482
When are you going
to quit the railroad

58
00:05:25,526 --> 00:05:27,267
and come to work for me?

59
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:29,399
Why, I hadn't given
it any thought.

60
00:06:20,189 --> 00:06:21,451
Boy, we're sure making it nice.

61
00:06:21,495 --> 00:06:22,974
I hope that West Bound
don't hold us up.

62
00:06:23,018 --> 00:06:24,672
Don't worry about
the West Bound.

63
00:06:24,715 --> 00:06:26,935
Tom Jordan will have her on the
side when we hit Plainville.

64
00:07:02,449 --> 00:07:03,406
Hey Bill?

65
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:04,929
That pump valve is stuck.

66
00:07:04,973 --> 00:07:06,366
Better take a look at it.

67
00:08:35,411 --> 00:08:36,934
Larry, the
West Bound and Hurricane

68
00:08:36,978 --> 00:08:38,066
Express are going to crash.

69
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:46,640
CO-What are you doing?

70
00:08:46,683 --> 00:08:48,903
I'm going to try and
sidetrack one of those trains.

71
00:08:48,946 --> 00:08:50,252
CO-You can't
make a landing here,

72
00:08:50,295 --> 00:08:51,383
you'll stack up the plane.

73
00:08:51,427 --> 00:08:52,646
I've got to take that chance.

74
00:08:52,689 --> 00:08:54,386
We can't let those trains crash.

75
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:59,870
Has Baker gone crazy?

76
00:08:59,914 --> 00:09:02,699
Tell him I said he is
not to attempt a landing.

77
00:09:02,743 --> 00:09:03,657
Orders from Grey.

78
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:05,572
I knew he'd stop you.

79
00:09:05,615 --> 00:09:07,704
He can't stop me,
orders or no orders.

80
00:09:07,748 --> 00:09:09,663
Those people are racing
to certain death.

81
00:09:54,446 --> 00:09:55,839
My god!

82
00:10:12,334 --> 00:10:15,729
Save yourself, Bill— jump.

83
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:34,574
Oh, dad!

84
00:10:41,711 --> 00:10:42,843
Yes, Mr. Grey.

85
00:10:42,886 --> 00:10:44,279
I gave him your orders, but—

86
00:10:44,322 --> 00:10:46,194
Well, you tell
Baker he's fired.

87
00:10:46,237 --> 00:10:47,238
You take the plane on yourself.

88
00:10:53,897 --> 00:10:54,724
He died instantly.

89
00:10:56,421 --> 00:10:58,641
He might have saved
himself if he had jumped.

90
00:10:58,685 --> 00:11:00,774
Jim Baker wasn't that kind.

91
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:04,038
He knew it was his life
or ours, and he gave his.

92
00:11:07,302 --> 00:11:08,564
You did this.

93
00:11:08,608 --> 00:11:10,740
You killed my father.

94
00:11:10,784 --> 00:11:13,438
It wasn't my fault.
Honestly, it wasn't.

95
00:11:13,482 --> 00:11:17,660
But honestly, someone— someone
struck me down from behind.

96
00:11:17,704 --> 00:11:18,487
Struck you down?

97
00:11:18,530 --> 00:11:20,271
Yeah.

98
00:11:20,315 --> 00:11:21,055
Struck you down?

99
00:11:21,098 --> 00:11:21,751
Uh-huh.

100
00:11:25,015 --> 00:11:28,105
Then these wrecks haven't
been accidents after all.

101
00:11:28,149 --> 00:11:30,804
Oh, but who could have held such
a grudge against the railroad?

102
00:11:30,847 --> 00:11:32,588
Why, there's plenty of them.

103
00:11:32,632 --> 00:11:34,068
Old Stratton, for instance.

104
00:11:34,111 --> 00:11:35,460
Didn't he threaten to get
even with the railroad

105
00:11:35,504 --> 00:11:36,984
for sending him to jail?

106
00:11:37,027 --> 00:11:38,942
And didn't he escape on back?

107
00:11:38,986 --> 00:11:43,773
Well, whoever is back of it,
it means my father was murdered.

108
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:46,341
And I'll bring that
murderer to justice if it

109
00:11:46,384 --> 00:11:47,647
takes the rest of my life.

110
00:12:43,093 --> 00:12:48,185
The Hurricane
Express— It gets you there.

111
00:12:48,229 --> 00:12:50,710
Sometimes.

112
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,124
Dad?

113
00:13:14,168 --> 00:13:14,821
Gloria.

114
00:13:18,476 --> 00:13:19,826
What are you doing here?

115
00:13:19,869 --> 00:13:21,088
I had to come.

116
00:13:21,131 --> 00:13:22,698
Dad, you've got to go back.

117
00:13:22,742 --> 00:13:24,134
Back?

118
00:13:24,178 --> 00:13:24,918
To prison?

119
00:13:24,961 --> 00:13:25,788
Yes.

120
00:13:25,832 --> 00:13:27,137
You were safe in prison.

121
00:13:27,181 --> 00:13:28,486
Now they suspect that
you're behind all

122
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,792
these mysterious
accidents on the railroad.

123
00:13:29,836 --> 00:13:31,533
There's been another
terrible wreck.

124
00:13:31,576 --> 00:13:33,622
Oh, never mind the wreck.

125
00:13:33,665 --> 00:13:35,102
I know all about it.

126
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:37,931
Dad, then you did have
something to do with it?

127
00:13:37,974 --> 00:13:41,717
Why, Gloria, are you
turning against me, too?

128
00:13:41,761 --> 00:13:44,938
When I tell you the railroad
company did frame me.

129
00:13:44,981 --> 00:13:46,678
They held out
evidence in my trial

130
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:48,376
that would have cleared me.

131
00:13:48,419 --> 00:13:50,508
I do believe in you, dad, and
I'm trying to find the papers

132
00:13:50,552 --> 00:13:53,773
at once, but I must be careful.

133
00:13:53,816 --> 00:13:56,471
Does anybody suspect that
you're uh, Gloria Stratton?

134
00:13:56,514 --> 00:13:58,038
No.

135
00:13:58,081 --> 00:13:59,169
To them, I'm just Gloria
Martin, the general manager's

136
00:13:59,213 --> 00:13:59,996
secretary.

137
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,389
Good, good.

138
00:14:01,432 --> 00:14:03,043
Everything depends upon you.

139
00:14:03,086 --> 00:14:07,830
Until you secure that evidence,
I'll be a hunted animal—

140
00:14:07,874 --> 00:14:09,049
a fugitive from justice.

141
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:22,062
And when you returned
from fixing the pump,

142
00:14:22,105 --> 00:14:23,803
where was Jordan?

143
00:14:23,846 --> 00:14:26,370
When I climbed into
the cab, Jordan was

144
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:27,850
just reaching for the throttle.

145
00:14:27,894 --> 00:14:31,071
But Mr. Edwards, I tell
you, I was just coming to.

146
00:14:31,114 --> 00:14:32,724
Now, we've heard
your story, Jordan.

147
00:14:35,815 --> 00:14:38,208
Carlson?

148
00:14:38,252 --> 00:14:39,949
Yes, sir?

149
00:14:39,993 --> 00:14:44,519
You reported that the 59
ran through your signal.

150
00:14:44,562 --> 00:14:48,653
Did you see anybody
in the engine cab?

151
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:50,220
Yes, sir, I did.

152
00:14:50,264 --> 00:14:52,135
Who was it?

153
00:14:52,179 --> 00:14:55,008
Uh, it was Jordan,
the engineer.

154
00:14:55,051 --> 00:14:58,838
That's a lie.

155
00:14:58,881 --> 00:15:00,361
You couldn't have seen me.

156
00:15:04,408 --> 00:15:05,409
Oh, I get it.

157
00:15:05,453 --> 00:15:08,586
It's a frame-up.

158
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:10,501
And you're in on it.

159
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:17,769
If, uh, you're through with
me, Mr. Edwards, I— I'd

160
00:15:17,813 --> 00:15:19,293
like to get back to my station.

161
00:15:19,336 --> 00:15:21,861
All right, Carlson, you may go.

162
00:15:21,904 --> 00:15:25,081
That concludes the inquiry.

163
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:27,127
Jordan, you will remain.

164
00:15:33,568 --> 00:15:35,918
The evidence in the
case proves that you are

165
00:15:35,962 --> 00:15:38,399
guilty of criminal negligence.

166
00:15:38,442 --> 00:15:39,487
You are discharged.

167
00:15:43,447 --> 00:15:46,668
Discharged, am I?

168
00:15:46,711 --> 00:15:49,671
After 30 years of
faithful service.

169
00:15:49,714 --> 00:15:51,281
And now the lying
word of a boomer agent

170
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,718
that just slipped in here
about three months ago.

171
00:15:53,762 --> 00:15:56,721
Need you render a
decision now, Mr. Edwards?

172
00:15:56,765 --> 00:15:59,594
As counsel for the road,
I feel that this matter

173
00:15:59,637 --> 00:16:02,031
requires further investigation.

174
00:16:02,075 --> 00:16:04,947
Why, the evidence is clear.

175
00:16:04,991 --> 00:16:07,732
My decision is final.

176
00:16:07,776 --> 00:16:10,170
So you're making me the goat?

177
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:11,998
For the past three months,
things have been going wrong

178
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:16,045
on this road— late trains,
open switches, overlapping

179
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:19,483
orders, mysterious
wrecks, and you can't

180
00:16:19,527 --> 00:16:21,659
find out who's responsible.

181
00:16:21,703 --> 00:16:24,358
Well, you're not going
to frame it onto me.

182
00:16:24,401 --> 00:16:28,057
Nobody's trying to frame
anything on you, Jordan.

183
00:16:28,101 --> 00:16:28,971
You're discharged for cause.

184
00:16:32,018 --> 00:16:36,413
Oh, that's the answer, is it?

185
00:16:36,457 --> 00:16:42,028
So you're blacklisting me—
driving me out of railroading.

186
00:16:42,071 --> 00:16:44,378
All right, Mr. Edwards.

187
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,684
You've made a marked
man out of me.

188
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:48,512
Now you watch my smoke.

189
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:49,861
Is that a threat?

190
00:16:49,905 --> 00:16:51,776
I am done talking.

191
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:53,430
Actions speak louder than words.

192
00:17:11,492 --> 00:17:14,147
I believe Jordan
told the truth.

193
00:17:14,190 --> 00:17:16,540
There must be someone behind
all these wrecks— someone with

194
00:17:16,584 --> 00:17:18,760
a grudge against the railroad.

195
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:21,023
Why Larry, what
makes you say that?

196
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:23,678
Didn't you notice how
Carlson acted in there?

197
00:17:23,721 --> 00:17:25,810
He was afraid of something.

198
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:27,595
He knew more than he told.

199
00:17:27,638 --> 00:17:30,554
And I'm going down to Plainville
tonight and check up on me.

200
00:17:30,598 --> 00:17:32,643
Larry, what good
will that do you?

201
00:17:32,687 --> 00:17:34,645
I intend to find the man
that caused that wreck

202
00:17:34,689 --> 00:17:35,733
and murdered my father.

203
00:17:53,621 --> 00:17:56,015
MR. But don't
you see, Stevens?

204
00:17:56,058 --> 00:17:58,147
Even if Jordan is
innocent, we can't

205
00:17:58,191 --> 00:18:00,410
admit that there've been
any mysterious happenings

206
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,716
on the road.

207
00:18:01,759 --> 00:18:03,848
We've lost too much
business already.

208
00:18:03,892 --> 00:18:06,590
The air transport company
is eating into our passenger

209
00:18:06,634 --> 00:18:08,331
traffic, and—

210
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:11,465
Do you suppose that Walter Gray
could be our mysterious enemy?

211
00:18:11,508 --> 00:18:13,075
I wouldn't be
surprised, but, uh—

212
00:18:13,119 --> 00:18:14,642
You know, he's never forgiven
you for having fired him

213
00:18:14,685 --> 00:18:16,383
as traffic manager of the road.

214
00:18:16,426 --> 00:18:18,037
I know.

215
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:21,779
But there's someone else I
have more reason to suspect.

216
00:18:21,823 --> 00:18:22,693
Who's that?

217
00:18:32,094 --> 00:18:34,009
Stratton?

218
00:18:34,053 --> 00:18:35,619
Now that you mention
it, you know,

219
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:37,273
it is strange that all
these things have happened

220
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:40,233
since he escaped from prison.

221
00:18:40,276 --> 00:18:43,192
You know, I'll never
be safe until Stratton

222
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:44,889
is again behind the bars.

223
00:18:53,811 --> 00:18:56,423
Uh, this man will be in your
engine cab throughout the run.

224
00:19:24,755 --> 00:19:25,582
All aboard!

225
00:20:37,654 --> 00:20:39,700
What's happened?

226
00:20:39,743 --> 00:20:41,223
The Hurricane Express.

227
00:20:41,267 --> 00:20:43,704
Stop her or she'll be wrecked.

228
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:51,059
Quick, The Wrecker— he's
on the Hurricane Express.

229
00:20:51,102 --> 00:20:51,755
Don't move.

230
00:21:00,982 --> 00:21:03,202
OK, Sandy, tie him up, too.

231
00:21:23,309 --> 00:21:25,136
Quick, we've gotta stop him.

232
00:22:34,423 --> 00:22:35,990
Do you see anything suspicious?

233
00:22:36,033 --> 00:22:37,252
No, not a thing.

234
00:22:53,486 --> 00:22:55,314
Open up,
Hemi, it's Matthews.

235
00:23:14,898 --> 00:23:16,378
Everything OK, Bill?

236
00:23:16,422 --> 00:23:17,118
OK.

237
00:23:53,372 --> 00:23:55,069
It won't be long now.

238
00:23:55,112 --> 00:23:57,898
And what a smash it's gonna be.

239
00:23:57,941 --> 00:23:59,552
But what's gonna
happen to The Wrecker?

240
00:23:59,595 --> 00:24:00,901
He's on the train.

241
00:24:00,944 --> 00:24:02,293
Don't worry.

242
00:24:02,337 --> 00:24:03,904
He won't be on there
when she crashes.

243
00:24:13,087 --> 00:24:14,088
It's only Bill.

244
00:24:19,833 --> 00:24:20,660
Hello, Bill.

245
00:24:20,703 --> 00:24:22,009
Seen The Wrecker yet?

246
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,269
Help!

247
00:25:05,313 --> 00:25:05,966
Help!

248
00:25:11,232 --> 00:25:12,755
Bill?

249
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:14,278
What's happened?

250
00:25:14,322 --> 00:25:17,891
Somebody dragged me in
here and knocked me cold.

251
00:25:17,934 --> 00:25:18,587
The Wrecker!

252
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:58,453
Watch it, here she comes.

253
00:26:29,005 --> 00:26:30,572
I couldn't fix the smash.

254
00:26:30,616 --> 00:26:32,922
That guy, Eric Baker butted
in and stopped the wreck.

255
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:34,750
How we gonna get
the gold out now?

256
00:26:34,794 --> 00:26:35,795
Where's The Wrecker?

257
00:26:35,838 --> 00:26:37,318
Why, he got away in the plane.

258
00:26:40,887 --> 00:26:42,236
Here he comes, now.

259
00:26:47,328 --> 00:26:49,635
He's come back to get the gold.

260
00:26:54,727 --> 00:26:56,729
You stay here and
guard the gold.

261
00:26:56,772 --> 00:26:58,687
Take no chances— shoot to kill.

262
00:27:01,647 --> 00:27:02,691
I've got you covered.

263
00:27:02,735 --> 00:27:04,998
Get down out of there.

264
00:27:05,041 --> 00:27:06,826
Larry Baker?

265
00:27:06,869 --> 00:27:08,741
So you're The Wrecker, huh?

266
00:27:08,784 --> 00:27:10,351
I am not.

267
00:27:10,394 --> 00:27:13,397
There's a conductor that
killed the engineer and guard.

268
00:27:13,441 --> 00:27:14,790
A conductor, eh?

269
00:27:17,663 --> 00:27:19,360
We got the man that
slugged you, Bill.

270
00:27:19,403 --> 00:27:20,491
Can you identify him?

271
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:22,537
I tell you, he's The Wrecker.

272
00:27:22,581 --> 00:27:24,713
He was fighting the fireman
when I came up in my car.

273
00:27:24,757 --> 00:27:26,585
In your car, eh?

274
00:27:26,628 --> 00:27:28,238
Yes, I was chasing
this train to get

275
00:27:28,282 --> 00:27:30,719
him— the man who murdered my
father in yesterday's wreck.

276
00:27:30,763 --> 00:27:33,722
How did you know The
Wrecker was on this train?

277
00:27:33,766 --> 00:27:35,811
I found out at the
station in Plainville.

278
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,606
And you're positive that this
was the man you were fighting

279
00:27:47,649 --> 00:27:49,346
with in the engine cab?

280
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,739
I'll swear to it.

281
00:27:50,783 --> 00:27:54,134
That proves your whole
story a pack of lies.

282
00:27:54,177 --> 00:27:56,963
I found him tied up in the
compartment of a Pullman car

283
00:27:57,006 --> 00:27:58,660
just before the crash.

284
00:27:58,704 --> 00:28:00,444
Mister detective?

285
00:28:00,488 --> 00:28:03,447
M-mister detective?

286
00:28:03,491 --> 00:28:05,275
Mister detective?

287
00:28:05,319 --> 00:28:07,626
The conductor's
done been murdered.

288
00:28:07,669 --> 00:28:09,671
Somebody cut his head off.

289
00:28:09,715 --> 00:28:10,890
Ooh!

290
00:28:10,933 --> 00:28:15,155
L-l-lordy—
th-there's his ghost.

291
00:28:15,198 --> 00:28:17,418
Well, looks like
everybody's been seeing me

292
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:19,638
in two places at the same time.

293
00:28:19,681 --> 00:28:21,727
Show us what you're
talking about, Sam.

294
00:28:21,770 --> 00:28:23,163
Get busy with the crew.

295
00:28:23,206 --> 00:28:25,382
Clear the engine, back
it down the main line.

296
00:28:25,426 --> 00:28:27,733
The Hurricane Express
must get through on time.

297
00:28:44,271 --> 00:28:46,273
There it is, right over there.

298
00:28:46,316 --> 00:28:49,102
See it right there?

299
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:51,321
Well, can you beat that?

300
00:28:51,365 --> 00:28:53,454
And it sure looks like me.

301
00:29:26,226 --> 00:29:28,576
No wonder Baker
thought he saw me.

302
00:29:28,619 --> 00:29:31,710
This proves he told the truth.

303
00:29:31,753 --> 00:29:34,930
So that's how
The Wrecker works?

304
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:38,281
Well, he can't be far away.

305
00:29:38,325 --> 00:29:40,544
Ah, let him go.

306
00:29:40,588 --> 00:29:41,937
This clears Baker.

307
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:37,645
Someone's getting
away with the gold.

308
00:30:37,688 --> 00:30:38,994
Say, we can track
them in the plane.

309
00:30:42,824 --> 00:30:44,086
The Wrecker again.

310
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,305
We can head him off
at the next station.

311
00:30:45,348 --> 00:30:46,785
I'll get the emergency pole.

312
00:30:50,353 --> 00:30:51,920
Dad, please.

313
00:30:51,964 --> 00:30:52,616
Don't you realize—

314
00:30:59,754 --> 00:31:02,583
Larry,
wait, you don't understand.

315
00:31:02,626 --> 00:31:03,584
Dad, don't.

316
00:31:03,627 --> 00:31:04,280
Stop.

317
00:31:10,983 --> 00:31:13,594
That's one of Gray's
transport planes.

318
00:31:13,637 --> 00:31:16,292
I knew that he had
a hand in this.

319
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,221
I've got him.

320
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,005
I've got The Wrecker.

321
00:31:37,923 --> 00:31:39,881
Walter Gray.

322
00:31:39,925 --> 00:31:41,622
Yeah, the head of
the air transport

323
00:31:41,665 --> 00:31:43,580
line— the one man
who had good reason

324
00:31:43,624 --> 00:31:45,495
to want to wreck our train.

325
00:31:45,539 --> 00:31:46,801
That's a lie.

326
00:31:46,845 --> 00:31:48,107
Who is this crazy fool?

327
00:31:48,150 --> 00:31:49,151
He's Tom Jordan.

328
00:31:49,195 --> 00:31:50,457
He used to work for the road.

329
00:31:50,500 --> 00:31:51,806
Yeah.

330
00:31:51,850 --> 00:31:53,199
You're the one that
made me lose my job.

331
00:31:53,242 --> 00:31:55,244
You slugged me and
caused the wreck.

332
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:56,593
I know nothing about it.

333
00:31:56,637 --> 00:31:59,379
Just what are you
doing here, Mr. Gray?

334
00:31:59,422 --> 00:32:02,556
Why, uh, I, uh, I
was flying overhead

335
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:05,037
and saw the train crash and came
down to see if I could help.

336
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:05,907
You did not.

337
00:32:05,951 --> 00:32:07,604
You were on the train.

338
00:32:07,648 --> 00:32:09,693
I had my eye on
you from the start,

339
00:32:09,737 --> 00:32:11,521
but you gave me the slip
just before the wreck.

340
00:32:11,565 --> 00:32:14,437
I'm sorry Mr. Gray,
but we'll have to hold

341
00:32:14,481 --> 00:32:16,831
you until we clear this up.

342
00:32:16,875 --> 00:32:18,528
Why, this is ridiculous.

343
00:32:18,572 --> 00:32:21,488
I'd better phone ahead and stop
the engine at Junction Point.

344
00:32:21,531 --> 00:32:22,532
Look, here's the car.

345
00:32:22,576 --> 00:32:23,707
We can chase the engine.

346
00:32:23,751 --> 00:32:25,448
Good.

347
00:32:25,492 --> 00:32:28,277
You see that Mr. Gray here is
turned over to the authorities.

348
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:29,975
And you'd better stick
with him, Jordan.

349
00:32:30,018 --> 00:32:31,585
We'll overtake the
train at the junction.

350
00:32:41,943 --> 00:32:43,553
You talk like a fool.

351
00:32:43,597 --> 00:32:45,816
If I hadn't run off
with the express car,

352
00:32:45,860 --> 00:32:47,209
those robbers would
have got the gold.

353
00:32:47,253 --> 00:32:49,472
But dad, the railroad
company already believes

354
00:32:49,516 --> 00:32:50,430
that you're The Wrecker.

355
00:32:50,473 --> 00:32:51,779
This makes it look worse.

356
00:32:51,822 --> 00:32:53,999
I'm not trying
to steal the gold.

357
00:32:54,042 --> 00:32:56,566
It gives me a whip
hand over the railroad.

358
00:32:56,610 --> 00:32:57,480
A whip hand?

359
00:32:57,524 --> 00:32:59,830
What do you mean, dad?

360
00:32:59,874 --> 00:33:02,094
They sent me to
prison on a frame-up.

361
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:04,966
They held out evidence
that would have cleared me.

362
00:33:05,010 --> 00:33:06,750
And they'll either
produce that evidence,

363
00:33:06,794 --> 00:33:10,319
or they'll never
get this gold again.

364
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:11,103
You—

365
00:33:11,146 --> 00:33:12,669
Wait, Larry.

366
00:33:12,713 --> 00:33:13,932
He's my father.

367
00:33:13,975 --> 00:33:14,845
Your father?

368
00:33:14,889 --> 00:33:16,238
Yes.

369
00:33:16,282 --> 00:33:17,587
He's trying to save the
gold from The Wrecker,

370
00:33:17,631 --> 00:33:19,938
and he thought you
were one of his gang.

371
00:33:19,981 --> 00:33:23,767
Oh, so you're working
for the railroad, eh?

372
00:33:23,811 --> 00:33:27,249
Yeah, I'm working
for the railroad.

373
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:31,123
Why, look.

374
00:33:45,224 --> 00:33:47,661
We'll throw a scare into them.

375
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:02,023
Without the temper, we'll
be to death.

376
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:16,037
Th engine is stopping.

377
00:34:16,081 --> 00:34:17,256
Bring her around, Sandy.

378
00:34:17,299 --> 00:34:17,996
We're landing.

379
00:34:57,122 --> 00:34:58,384
Well, they shan't
get that gold.

380
00:34:58,427 --> 00:34:59,428
- Wait a minute.
- Huh?

381
00:34:59,472 --> 00:35:01,648
We can't face that machine gun.

382
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:02,605
I've got a better plan.

383
00:35:31,199 --> 00:35:33,288
Be ready to shove
off when we come back, Sandy.

384
00:35:33,332 --> 00:35:34,028
OK.

385
00:36:20,857 --> 00:36:23,251
Hide in here until they get
the rest of the gold aboard.

386
00:36:39,049 --> 00:36:40,138
All set to go, Sandy?

387
00:36:40,181 --> 00:36:40,834
OK.

388
00:37:00,897 --> 00:37:04,162
Barney, look out!

389
00:37:04,205 --> 00:37:05,337
Larry Baker's on the plane.

390
00:37:19,829 --> 00:37:23,746
They got us, keep low.

391
00:37:33,234 --> 00:37:35,628
we're safe now.

392
00:37:35,671 --> 00:37:39,109
They're too far away.

393
00:37:44,114 --> 00:37:46,943
Larry, the plane's on fire!

394
00:37:53,472 --> 00:37:54,864
That's got 'em.

395
00:38:07,050 --> 00:38:11,359
Count 10 before you pull the
cord and you'll be all right.

396
00:38:21,630 --> 00:38:23,893
If she hadn't
crashed so far away,

397
00:38:23,937 --> 00:38:25,678
we'd still have a chance
of getting the gold.

398
00:38:28,768 --> 00:38:31,249
I've got it.

399
00:38:31,292 --> 00:38:32,424
The engine.

400
00:38:32,467 --> 00:38:34,208
You're right.

401
00:38:34,252 --> 00:38:36,123
If we can get her running, we
can run down there in no time.

402
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,178
Dad?

403
00:38:48,222 --> 00:38:51,181
Dad, where are you?

404
00:38:51,225 --> 00:38:52,182
Dad?

405
00:38:52,226 --> 00:38:54,184
Dad, are you all right?

406
00:38:54,228 --> 00:38:55,534
All right so far, Gloria.

407
00:38:59,102 --> 00:38:59,799
Dad.

408
00:39:01,322 --> 00:39:02,584
We must get this
gold away from here

409
00:39:02,628 --> 00:39:04,107
at once before The
Wrecker's gang arrives.

410
00:39:04,151 --> 00:39:06,327
But they're miles away
from here now, dad.

411
00:39:06,371 --> 00:39:08,024
But they must have
seen the plane crash,

412
00:39:08,068 --> 00:39:09,548
and they're sure to follow us.

413
00:39:09,591 --> 00:39:11,027
There must be a
farmhouse around here

414
00:39:11,071 --> 00:39:11,985
where we can get a car.

415
00:39:12,028 --> 00:39:14,770
Yes, that's a good idea.

416
00:39:14,814 --> 00:39:16,206
Oh, ooh, ooh.

417
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,991
Dad, what is it?

418
00:39:18,034 --> 00:39:22,430
Oh, I hurt my leg
when I landed, I guess.

419
00:39:22,474 --> 00:39:23,997
Now you two go after
a car and I-I'll

420
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,651
wait here till you get back.

421
00:39:25,694 --> 00:39:28,784
I'd better wait here with
dad, he seems to be badly hurt.

422
00:39:28,828 --> 00:39:30,133
Please go alone.

423
00:39:30,177 --> 00:39:33,093
I'll be back soon.

424
00:39:33,136 --> 00:39:36,749
Now quick, quick,
we've no time to waste.

425
00:39:36,792 --> 00:39:41,406
Well dad, you're
not hurt at all.

426
00:39:41,449 --> 00:39:43,756
Oh well, I had to
do that in order

427
00:39:43,799 --> 00:39:45,932
to get Baker to leave
us here alone so he

428
00:39:45,975 --> 00:39:47,281
wouldn't suspect anything.

429
00:39:47,325 --> 00:39:51,981
Dad, you're not going
to steal the gold.

430
00:39:52,025 --> 00:39:54,070
I'm going to use it as a
weapon to fight the railroad.

431
00:39:54,114 --> 00:39:55,985
But that's not the
way to clear yourself.

432
00:39:56,029 --> 00:39:57,726
I'm justified in
using any means

433
00:39:57,770 --> 00:40:00,555
against the people that sent
me to prison on a false charge.

434
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,252
They held out evidence
that would have cleared me,

435
00:40:02,296 --> 00:40:03,906
and wither they'll
produce that evidence

436
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,343
or they ll never
see that gold again.

437
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:06,953
Don't you see, you're
only making it worse.

438
00:40:06,996 --> 00:40:08,694
Oh, nothing is worse
than rotting in jail

439
00:40:08,737 --> 00:40:09,782
when you know that
you're innocent.

440
00:40:28,496 --> 00:40:29,976
Douse that light.

441
00:40:30,019 --> 00:40:31,369
There's a car coming.

442
00:40:37,418 --> 00:40:39,333
Careful, Matthews.

443
00:40:39,377 --> 00:40:42,423
I think I saw a light flash
in the cab of that engine.

444
00:40:42,467 --> 00:40:43,424
Yeah?

445
00:40:43,468 --> 00:40:44,947
Well, you get your gun ready.

446
00:40:44,991 --> 00:40:46,558
We'll hand those birds
a little surprise.

447
00:40:52,085 --> 00:40:53,478
It's the railroad dicks.

448
00:40:53,521 --> 00:40:55,784
They left their
car in the brush.

449
00:40:55,828 --> 00:40:56,698
Let's grab it.

450
00:41:19,329 --> 00:41:20,461
What's that?

451
00:41:20,505 --> 00:41:21,941
They've got our car.

452
00:41:27,468 --> 00:41:28,774
Hurry, Gloria, this
is the last box.

453
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:40,089
Mind now, if you
damage the car any,

454
00:41:40,133 --> 00:41:42,091
I'll take it out
of your deposit.

455
00:41:42,135 --> 00:41:42,918
Well, I'll be careful.

456
00:42:00,936 --> 00:42:02,460
Gloria?

457
00:42:02,503 --> 00:42:03,199
Gloria?

458
00:42:13,166 --> 00:42:14,602
We can't be far from it now.

459
00:42:19,085 --> 00:42:19,738
There they are.

460
00:42:32,577 --> 00:42:33,403
Stand where you are, Baker.

461
00:42:36,755 --> 00:42:39,192
We're going to save you
the trouble of getting

462
00:42:39,235 --> 00:42:40,802
that gold out of plane.

463
00:42:40,846 --> 00:42:42,064
Here, Sandy.

464
00:42:42,108 --> 00:42:43,501
Watch him while we
get the stuff out.

465
00:42:52,031 --> 00:42:53,859
Say, what you got there, Baker?

466
00:42:53,902 --> 00:42:54,729
It ain't here.

467
00:42:54,773 --> 00:42:55,469
The gold's gone.

468
00:43:03,433 --> 00:43:04,783
Baker's got the gold!

469
00:43:04,826 --> 00:43:07,612
Stop him!

470
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,535
Hurry
up, get in the car.

471
00:43:34,421 --> 00:43:35,335
Don't come any further, dad.

472
00:43:35,378 --> 00:43:36,510
Someone might recognize you.

473
00:43:53,832 --> 00:43:55,050
When is the next train to town?

474
00:43:55,094 --> 00:43:56,791
There's an early
local in a few minutes.

475
00:43:56,835 --> 00:43:57,531
Thank you.

476
00:45:33,975 --> 00:45:35,847
He's making for the trestle.

477
00:46:18,890 --> 00:46:20,065
Anybody hurt?

478
00:46:20,108 --> 00:46:21,414
No, I guess not.

479
00:46:21,457 --> 00:46:23,198
But the thieves we
were chasing got away.

480
00:46:23,242 --> 00:46:24,417
Lucky you weren't killed.

481
00:46:24,460 --> 00:46:26,375
Well, I'll have to report this.

482
00:46:26,419 --> 00:46:28,247
You better come back
to town with me.

483
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:53,315
There's the dame
that was with Baker.

484
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,535
She knows where the gold is.

485
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:58,016
We've got to get a hold of her.

486
00:46:58,059 --> 00:46:59,887
She'll tell.

487
00:46:59,931 --> 00:47:03,108
You step off the train at the
next station and phone Jake

488
00:47:03,151 --> 00:47:06,938
and tell him to meet the train
with a taxi at the terminal.

489
00:47:28,394 --> 00:47:29,047
Hi.

490
00:48:22,927 --> 00:48:25,190
Where's The Wrecker?

491
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:25,886
Here he is now.

492
00:48:30,369 --> 00:48:32,545
Walter Gray.

493
00:48:32,588 --> 00:48:33,807
So you're The Wrecker.

494
00:48:33,851 --> 00:48:35,765
Never mind that.

495
00:48:35,809 --> 00:48:38,856
All we want out of you is
where Baker hid the gold.

496
00:48:42,424 --> 00:48:44,513
You'd better come through.

497
00:48:44,557 --> 00:48:48,474
We know you were with Baker
when he stole the plane.

498
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:49,736
Speak up, or else.

499
00:48:56,221 --> 00:48:59,746
I'm giving you just one
more chance to talk.

500
00:48:59,789 --> 00:49:01,356
Up with your hands,
every one of you.

501
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:02,923
Larry.

502
00:49:02,967 --> 00:49:03,881
Quick, Gloria— get the police
while I keep them covered.

503
00:49:13,978 --> 00:49:19,157
So you're The Wrecker— the
man who murdered my father.

504
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:23,552
I swore I'd get you.

505
00:49:23,596 --> 00:49:28,731
You're not going to shoot
me down in cold blood.

506
00:49:28,775 --> 00:49:30,211
Why shouldn't I?

507
00:49:30,255 --> 00:49:33,475
You didn't give my
father a chance, did you?

508
00:49:33,519 --> 00:49:35,521
Don't shoot him,
he knows where the gold is.

509
00:49:41,614 --> 00:49:44,008
What's the rush, sister?

510
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:45,400
No you don't.

511
00:49:45,444 --> 00:49:47,315
You're staying right
here till The Wrecker

512
00:49:47,359 --> 00:49:49,317
gets through with you.

513
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,127
Hands up.

514
00:50:16,170 --> 00:50:17,737
I've got you covered.

515
00:50:17,780 --> 00:50:18,607
No you haven't.

516
00:50:18,651 --> 00:50:20,044
Drop that gun, Baker.

517
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:32,491
Can't see me, eh?

518
00:50:32,534 --> 00:50:35,059
Well, that's too bad.

519
00:50:35,102 --> 00:50:37,931
What did you do with the gold
bars you took from my men

520
00:50:37,975 --> 00:50:39,019
today?

521
00:50:39,063 --> 00:50:43,632
been expecting you.

522
00:50:43,676 --> 00:50:47,114
Something must have gone wrong.

523
00:50:47,158 --> 00:50:49,812
Well, I am not going
to wait any longer.

524
00:50:49,856 --> 00:50:54,774
The Wrecker is not going to
get away from me this time.

525
00:50:54,817 --> 00:50:56,471
Well, go ahead and shoot.

526
00:50:56,515 --> 00:51:00,171
That's the signal the
detectives are waiting for.

527
00:51:00,214 --> 00:51:04,784
Oh, it kind of worries you, eh?

528
00:51:34,379 --> 00:51:36,468
The Wrecker, I've killed him.

529
00:51:44,824 --> 00:51:47,653
It's Larry Baker— the
man we met in the hall

530
00:51:47,696 --> 00:51:51,439
was The Wrecker wearing a mask.

531
00:51:51,483 --> 00:51:53,224
You search the house,
the rest of you outside.

532
00:51:53,267 --> 00:51:54,660
He can't be far away.

533
00:52:12,156 --> 00:52:13,635
Did you see any sign of him?
- Nuh-uh.

534
00:52:21,252 --> 00:52:21,948
The Wrecker.

535
00:52:27,345 --> 00:52:28,563
But Baker's gone.

536
00:52:48,192 --> 00:52:51,195
Stay where you are.

537
00:52:51,238 --> 00:52:53,893
I've got you at last.

538
00:52:53,936 --> 00:52:56,156
Take off that mask and
let's see who you are.

539
00:53:26,491 --> 00:53:27,840
It's the boss.

540
00:53:36,283 --> 00:53:39,373
Grab hold here
and get him out of the car.

541
00:53:39,417 --> 00:53:40,896
Larry Baker.

542
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:43,508
Say, what did you want to
bring his body here for?

543
00:53:43,551 --> 00:53:45,292
He's
not dead, you fool.

544
00:53:45,336 --> 00:53:47,468
He ain't?

545
00:53:47,512 --> 00:53:48,687
But you told us we were to—

546
00:53:48,730 --> 00:53:50,036
I know what I said.

547
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:51,864
But Baker knows
where the gold is.

548
00:53:51,907 --> 00:53:54,040
We've got to make
him talk first.

549
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:55,911
Pull him out and see if
you can bring him to.

550
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:13,712
He's dead to the world.

551
00:54:13,755 --> 00:54:17,585
You must have hit
him an awful wallop.

552
00:54:17,629 --> 00:54:20,327
Well, I can't wait
till he recovers.

553
00:54:20,371 --> 00:54:21,894
I've got to get
back to the office.

554
00:54:21,937 --> 00:54:25,767
If I'm not there in the morning,
it may arouse suspicion.

555
00:54:25,811 --> 00:54:28,683
As soon as he comes to,
make him talk, and phone me.

556
00:54:54,753 --> 00:54:56,581
Get that rope
and we'll tie him up.

557
00:55:01,629 --> 00:55:02,935
That'll hold until he wakes up.

558
00:55:02,978 --> 00:55:04,023
Come on, let's finish our game.

559
00:55:22,824 --> 00:55:23,782
What's that?

560
00:55:23,825 --> 00:55:25,044
Sit down and play your hand.

561
00:55:25,087 --> 00:55:26,741
If you're going
to jump every time

562
00:55:26,785 --> 00:55:28,613
a rat runs across this roof,
you'll give us all the willies.

563
00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:37,099
You have to make a run for it.

564
00:55:37,143 --> 00:55:39,493
Stall
them as long as you can.

565
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:42,670
I'll get word to
Gloria to send help.

566
00:55:42,714 --> 00:55:44,019
No.

567
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:44,933
That'll take too long.

568
00:55:44,977 --> 00:55:47,022
I have a better idea.

569
00:55:47,066 --> 00:55:50,374
The Wrecker thinks I know where
the gold shipment is hidden.

570
00:55:50,417 --> 00:55:52,767
Now, if I can trick
him out into the open,

571
00:55:52,811 --> 00:55:55,466
we stand a good chance
of capturing him,

572
00:55:55,509 --> 00:55:58,033
and his gang, too.

573
00:55:58,077 --> 00:55:59,383
Yes.

574
00:55:59,426 --> 00:56:00,297
How you gonna work it?

575
00:56:11,569 --> 00:56:12,700
Everything's OK.

576
00:56:12,744 --> 00:56:13,832
You can see for
yourself, there's

577
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:16,225
nothing to get jumpy about.

578
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:16,922
Come on.

579
00:56:22,928 --> 00:56:25,844
Listen—

580
00:56:25,887 --> 00:56:29,326
We hunted around for the rest
of the night, Mr. Edwards,

581
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:31,110
but we couldn't find
a trace of The Wrecker

582
00:56:31,153 --> 00:56:33,155
or how he got Larry Baker away.

583
00:56:33,199 --> 00:56:34,896
You've got to find him.

584
00:56:34,940 --> 00:56:37,377
His mysterious attacks
on the Hurricane Express

585
00:56:37,421 --> 00:56:38,770
are ruining this railroad.

586
00:56:38,813 --> 00:56:40,598
Yes, and making plenty
of business for Walter

587
00:56:40,641 --> 00:56:42,513
Gray's air transport company.

588
00:56:42,556 --> 00:56:44,166
How about Gray?

589
00:56:44,210 --> 00:56:45,907
Are you having him watched?

590
00:56:45,951 --> 00:56:46,778
No, sir

591
00:56:46,821 --> 00:56:48,432
Well, do so at once.

592
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:52,174
We've got to find Larry
Baker and unmask The Wrecker.

593
00:56:52,218 --> 00:56:55,047
Hemingway, get over
to the airport at once.

594
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:56,875
Don't let Walter Gray
get out of your sight.

595
00:56:56,918 --> 00:56:57,571
OK, chief.

596
00:57:23,336 --> 00:57:25,599
Come in.

597
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,427
Gloria, this is a pleasure.

598
00:57:31,692 --> 00:57:33,172
What brings you here?

599
00:57:33,215 --> 00:57:36,523
Nothing, Mr. Gray, except
that I've lost my job.

600
00:57:36,567 --> 00:57:39,004
Oh.

601
00:57:39,047 --> 00:57:41,920
My previous offer
still holds good.

602
00:57:41,963 --> 00:57:45,663
Why not come to
work for me, Gloria?

603
00:57:45,706 --> 00:57:46,707
Thank you.

604
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:47,534
When do you want me to start?

605
00:57:47,578 --> 00:57:49,318
Right now.

606
00:57:49,362 --> 00:57:50,189
I'll show you your office.

607
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:59,459
I've uh, held this in
reserve for you a long time.

608
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,821
Hello, Mr. Jordan.

609
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:14,518
Morning.

610
00:58:20,393 --> 00:58:21,960
Could I have a word
with you, Mr. Gray?

611
00:58:22,003 --> 00:58:22,830
Sure.

612
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:23,614
Go right into my office.

613
00:58:28,227 --> 00:58:29,446
I'll be with you
in a minute, Gloria.

614
00:58:37,541 --> 00:58:38,672
You're taking an
awful chance having

615
00:58:38,716 --> 00:58:39,543
that girl in this office.

616
00:58:39,586 --> 00:58:40,631
Ah, nonsense.

617
00:58:40,674 --> 00:58:42,154
She can't do any harm.

618
00:58:42,197 --> 00:58:43,938
But I tell you,
we're under suspicion now.

619
00:58:43,982 --> 00:58:45,592
We gotta be careful.

620
00:58:53,600 --> 00:58:55,515
Hello?

621
00:58:55,559 --> 00:58:57,299
Dad?

622
00:58:57,343 --> 00:59:00,477
I've had a hard time trying
to locate you, Gloria.

623
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:04,437
Larry is leading The Wrecker's
gang to Logan's Flatts.

624
00:59:04,481 --> 00:59:05,873
The Wrecker's going
to meet them there.

625
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,527
Larry is gambling with death.

626
00:59:07,571 --> 00:59:09,137
The Wrecker will kill him
the moment that he finds out

627
00:59:09,181 --> 00:59:10,356
that he can't produce the gold.

628
00:59:10,399 --> 00:59:11,357
Get help fast.

629
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:12,097
All right, dad, I'll hurry.

630
00:59:22,281 --> 00:59:22,934
Mr. Edwards, please.

631
00:59:26,503 --> 00:59:27,852
Hello, Mr. Edwards?

632
00:59:27,895 --> 00:59:29,723
This is Gloria Martin.

633
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:32,073
Larry Baker is planning
to trap The Wrecker.

634
00:59:32,117 --> 00:59:33,727
If you send the detective
out to Logan Flatts,

635
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:35,294
you can capture
him and his gang.

636
00:59:35,337 --> 00:59:38,863
How do I know this isn't
some trick of yours?

637
00:59:38,906 --> 00:59:41,256
But Larry is taking
to capture The Wrecker.

638
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:42,475
You've got to believe me.

639
00:59:45,173 --> 00:59:47,698
I'll go out there
with your men myself.

640
00:59:47,741 --> 00:59:49,221
All right.

641
00:59:49,264 --> 00:59:50,744
I'll have Matthews
round up his men

642
00:59:50,788 --> 00:59:51,963
and meet you in front
of the building.

643
01:00:04,802 --> 01:00:08,196
Quick, Mr. Hemingway,
Mr. Edwards wants you.

644
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:10,155
They're going to
capture The Wrecker.

645
01:00:10,198 --> 01:00:11,330
I've got to stay here and—

646
01:00:11,373 --> 01:00:12,679
You've got to go.

647
01:00:12,723 --> 01:00:14,333
There isn't a moment to lose.

648
01:00:14,376 --> 01:00:15,247
Why, Larry's life is at stake.

649
01:00:22,820 --> 01:00:24,691
Hey, what'd I tell you?

650
01:00:27,781 --> 01:00:30,741
They must have overheard us.

651
01:00:30,784 --> 01:00:32,264
What if they did?

652
01:00:32,307 --> 01:00:33,961
We'll beat them out
there in my plane.

653
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:48,976
You get out there
as fast as you can.

654
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:49,890
I'll follow in my car.

655
01:01:32,367 --> 01:01:34,195
This is the place
you said, Baker.

656
01:01:34,239 --> 01:01:36,807
Now show us where
you've hidden the gold.

657
01:01:36,850 --> 01:01:39,636
Well, I've got to
get my bearings first.

658
01:01:39,679 --> 01:01:40,854
There was a landmark
near this spot.

659
01:02:13,234 --> 01:02:15,193
If there is any
landmark around here,

660
01:02:15,236 --> 01:02:16,934
you could have seen it by now.

661
01:02:16,977 --> 01:02:18,718
No stalling, Baker, or I'll—

662
01:02:30,338 --> 01:02:33,211
It's The Wrecker,
and he's just in time.

663
01:02:46,790 --> 01:02:48,705
Well, did you get it?

664
01:02:48,748 --> 01:02:51,708
It looks like Baker's
pulling a stall on us.

665
01:02:51,751 --> 01:02:53,579
Quit stalling, Baker.

666
01:02:53,622 --> 01:02:55,276
Show us where the gold is.

667
01:02:55,320 --> 01:02:57,148
And be quick about it, or—

668
01:02:57,191 --> 01:02:58,889
Or you'll shoot me, is that it?

669
01:02:58,932 --> 01:03:01,195
That's exactly
what will happen.

670
01:03:01,239 --> 01:03:04,068
Well, a fine chance you'll
have of finding the gold with me

671
01:03:04,111 --> 01:03:05,547
dead.

672
01:03:05,591 --> 01:03:08,159
I'll give you till the
count of three to decide.

673
01:03:08,202 --> 01:03:09,073
Get ready, Barney.

674
01:03:24,653 --> 01:03:25,654
1...

675
01:03:29,615 --> 01:03:30,616
2...

676
01:03:35,447 --> 01:03:36,056
3

677
01:03:37,710 --> 01:03:38,363
The cops!

678
01:04:37,335 --> 01:04:38,989
So you're The Wrecker!

679
01:04:39,032 --> 01:04:39,816
You—

680
01:04:50,304 --> 01:04:51,915
But I know that Gray
is not The Wrecker.

681
01:04:51,958 --> 01:04:54,395
But dad, how can you
be so sure of that?

682
01:04:54,439 --> 01:04:58,138
I can't tell you now,
Gloria, but I— I know it.

683
01:04:58,182 --> 01:04:59,879
Well one thing is certain,
dad— you've got to give

684
01:04:59,923 --> 01:05:00,880
the gold back to the railroad.

685
01:05:00,924 --> 01:05:02,751
What?

686
01:05:02,795 --> 01:05:04,362
And give up the only
chance that I have

687
01:05:04,405 --> 01:05:05,667
of forcing them to clear me?

688
01:05:05,711 --> 01:05:07,844
Well, it's the best
thing for you to do.

689
01:05:07,887 --> 01:05:10,759
Mr. Edwards' death has changed
the situation entirely.

690
01:05:10,803 --> 01:05:13,197
Now we know that he wasn't
holding back the information

691
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:13,937
that would clear you.

692
01:05:13,980 --> 01:05:15,677
Larry is right, dad.

693
01:05:15,721 --> 01:05:18,332
The theft of the gold is the
one— give it back to them.

694
01:05:18,376 --> 01:05:22,119
The Wrecker's the
one we must get.

695
01:05:22,162 --> 01:05:22,989
All right.

696
01:05:23,033 --> 01:05:23,816
I'll do it.

697
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:26,166
Oh, dad.

698
01:05:26,210 --> 01:05:27,776
Well, I never did
believe that you

699
01:05:27,820 --> 01:05:31,128
were responsible for wrecking
the Hurricane Express.

700
01:05:31,171 --> 01:05:32,564
Report for duty.

701
01:05:32,607 --> 01:05:34,653
I'll see that you
get your.

702
01:05:34,696 --> 01:05:36,133
Thank you, sir.

703
01:05:36,176 --> 01:05:36,916
Go.

704
01:05:36,960 --> 01:05:39,832
Thank you.

705
01:05:43,183 --> 01:05:43,923
Hello?

706
01:05:43,967 --> 01:05:45,882
Yes?

707
01:05:45,925 --> 01:05:48,449
Stevens talking.

708
01:05:48,493 --> 01:05:50,887
Who?

709
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,889
Stratton?

710
01:05:52,932 --> 01:05:54,281
You have the gold
shipment that was stolen

711
01:05:54,325 --> 01:05:56,153
from the Hurricane Express?

712
01:05:56,196 --> 01:05:58,982
You'll find it in
the old Forsythe Mine.

713
01:05:59,025 --> 01:06:01,723
35 paces from the entrance
to the north tunnel.

714
01:06:01,767 --> 01:06:05,249
Is that right?

715
01:06:07,425 --> 01:06:09,253
You gotta hand it
to The Wrecker—

716
01:06:09,296 --> 01:06:11,603
I'll bet the detectives
are howling yet

717
01:06:11,646 --> 01:06:14,475
about the way we rescued Gray.

718
01:06:17,000 --> 01:06:19,698
Fine chance you got of proving
you ain't The Wrecker now.

719
01:06:19,741 --> 01:06:21,395
So that's The
Wrecker's game, huh,

720
01:06:21,439 --> 01:06:23,441
to fasten his guilt onto me?

721
01:06:23,484 --> 01:06:24,703
Sure.

722
01:06:24,746 --> 01:06:27,010
That's why he let you live.

723
01:06:27,053 --> 01:06:28,837
While the police
are hunting you,

724
01:06:28,881 --> 01:06:32,232
The Wrecker will be
sitting free and easy

725
01:06:32,276 --> 01:06:35,192
with nobody suspecting him.

726
01:06:35,235 --> 01:06:37,411
He's smart, all right.

727
01:06:40,240 --> 01:06:42,460
Hello?

728
01:06:42,503 --> 01:06:43,765
Yeah.

729
01:06:43,809 --> 01:06:44,636
It's the boss.

730
01:06:49,032 --> 01:06:50,294
Yeah, sure, chief.

731
01:06:50,337 --> 01:06:51,991
Right away.

732
01:06:52,035 --> 01:06:53,340
The Wrecker says
the gold is hidden

733
01:06:53,384 --> 01:06:54,994
in the abandoned mine shaft.

734
01:06:55,038 --> 01:06:57,170
The railroad detectives
are on their way there now.

735
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:58,345
We've got to beat them to it.

736
01:07:09,574 --> 01:07:11,750
The Wrecker has learned
of your message to Stevens

737
01:07:11,793 --> 01:07:13,708
and he's beating the railroad
detectives to the gold.

738
01:07:17,277 --> 01:07:19,192
It won't be long
now, Mr. Stratton.

739
01:07:19,236 --> 01:07:21,934
We'll wait till The Wrecker's
about to enter the mine,

740
01:07:21,978 --> 01:07:23,588
and then we'll pull
our little surprise.

741
01:07:31,639 --> 01:07:33,554
The Wrecker's not with them.

742
01:07:33,598 --> 01:07:35,034
He's outwitted us after all.

743
01:07:39,082 --> 01:07:40,431
You're not Stratton.

744
01:07:48,439 --> 01:07:49,918
Come on, boys.

745
01:07:49,962 --> 01:07:53,357
This interfering fool
won't trouble us again.

746
01:07:53,400 --> 01:07:59,319
All our enemies are out of
the way, and the gold is ours.

747
01:07:59,363 --> 01:08:00,277
It's Stratton.

748
01:08:00,320 --> 01:08:01,321
Don't shoot.

749
01:08:01,365 --> 01:08:03,976
It's The Wrecker wearing a mask.

750
01:08:04,020 --> 01:08:05,021
See?

751
01:08:05,064 --> 01:08:06,152
He's giving us the signal now.

752
01:08:11,331 --> 01:08:13,986
I thought you said you were
going to wear a grey mask.

753
01:08:14,030 --> 01:08:15,988
We nearly shot you by mistake.

754
01:08:16,032 --> 01:08:18,512
I had to change my plans
at the last minute in order

755
01:08:18,556 --> 01:08:19,992
to fool Baker.

756
01:08:20,036 --> 01:08:22,995
Get busy, boys— the
gold is over here.

757
01:08:26,955 --> 01:08:28,870
Clear that stuff away.

758
01:08:28,914 --> 01:08:29,871
Hustle, now.

759
01:08:29,915 --> 01:08:33,788
The gold is under it.

760
01:08:33,832 --> 01:08:35,660
The gold at last.

761
01:08:35,703 --> 01:08:38,402
They won't get it
away from us this time.

762
01:08:38,445 --> 01:08:39,403
Sure looks good to me.

763
01:08:39,446 --> 01:08:40,273
Don't move.

764
01:08:40,317 --> 01:08:41,666
I've got you covered.

765
01:08:47,019 --> 01:08:49,239
OK, Larry, we've got 'em.

766
01:08:49,282 --> 01:08:50,153
It's Stratton himself.

767
01:08:50,196 --> 01:08:51,545
He tricked us.

768
01:08:51,589 --> 01:08:53,286
Well, thanks to
Stratton, I've got you.

769
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:55,332
And I'll get The Wrecker, too.

770
01:08:55,375 --> 01:08:58,857
All right, Gus,
let 'em have it.

771
01:08:58,900 --> 01:08:59,858
Look out, Stratton.

772
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:00,859
Run for your life.

773
01:09:25,927 --> 01:09:27,320
shooting.

774
01:09:27,364 --> 01:09:28,887
You sneak up on Stratton.

775
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:30,018
I'll take care of Baker.

776
01:09:37,200 --> 01:09:38,636
It's Larry Baker.

777
01:09:38,679 --> 01:09:40,116
The Wrecker's gang
has him cornered.

778
01:09:42,379 --> 01:09:43,510
We gotta stop that
machine gun first.

779
01:10:09,928 --> 01:10:12,278
Now we'll get the
rest of the gang.

780
01:10:18,937 --> 01:10:20,504
The railroad
detectives got Gus.

781
01:10:20,547 --> 01:10:21,853
We have to beat it.

782
01:10:27,206 --> 01:10:29,165
Quick, Matthews, stop 'em.

783
01:10:29,208 --> 01:10:31,036
They're headed to the plane.

784
01:10:40,524 --> 01:10:42,134
Aw, they've give
us the slip again.

785
01:10:48,314 --> 01:10:51,317
Yes, but they
didn't get the gold.

786
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:53,101
Come on, I'll tell
you where it is.

787
01:10:58,019 --> 01:10:59,717
Well, there it is, Matthews.

788
01:10:59,760 --> 01:11:01,675
You showed up just
in time to save it.

789
01:11:13,687 --> 01:11:15,733
Well, the sooner we get this
stuff out of here, the better.

790
01:11:15,776 --> 01:11:16,908
I'll help you put
it in your car.

791
01:11:38,234 --> 01:11:39,104
Hello?

792
01:11:39,147 --> 01:11:39,887
Hello?

793
01:11:39,931 --> 01:11:42,368
Operator?

794
01:11:42,412 --> 01:11:44,109
This is an emergency call.

795
01:11:44,152 --> 01:11:46,677
Get me Crestview 4211.

796
01:11:54,293 --> 01:11:55,947
Hello?

797
01:11:55,990 --> 01:11:57,601
The Wrecker's gang are holding
me a prisoner in a warehouse

798
01:11:57,644 --> 01:11:58,819
near the freight yards.

799
01:11:58,863 --> 01:11:59,994
Yes, Mr. Gray, I
know where it is.

800
01:12:00,038 --> 01:12:00,734
I'll be right over.

801
01:12:20,667 --> 01:12:22,190
Gloria.

802
01:12:22,234 --> 01:12:24,541
Oh.

803
01:12:24,584 --> 01:12:27,283
Why didn't you want me
to phone the police?

804
01:12:27,326 --> 01:12:31,025
Well, the fact is Gloria,
I'm afraid The Wrecker

805
01:12:31,069 --> 01:12:32,853
is your father.

806
01:12:46,650 --> 01:12:47,390
Quick!

807
01:12:47,433 --> 01:12:48,129
Hide, Gloria.

808
01:12:58,139 --> 01:12:59,793
We'd have gotten the loot
easy if those detectives

809
01:12:59,837 --> 01:13:01,273
hadn't showed up when they did.

810
01:13:01,317 --> 01:13:03,406
What are we going to
tell The Wrecker now?

811
01:13:03,449 --> 01:13:06,365
So, you failed?

812
01:13:06,409 --> 01:13:08,889
Never mind the excuses now.

813
01:13:08,933 --> 01:13:11,805
We have one more chance to
get our hands on the gold.

814
01:13:14,678 --> 01:13:17,811
Stevens has ordered it shipped
on the Hurricane Express

815
01:13:17,855 --> 01:13:19,073
tonight.

816
01:13:19,117 --> 01:13:21,859
I'll be on the engine
myself and stop

817
01:13:21,902 --> 01:13:24,470
it at the sighting near Ashbox.

818
01:13:24,514 --> 01:13:26,298
The two of you will
be there with a car

819
01:13:26,342 --> 01:13:28,344
to take the gold away.

820
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:30,128
Get going now and
see that there's

821
01:13:30,171 --> 01:13:31,434
no slipping up this time.

822
01:13:40,834 --> 01:13:42,358
Come on, he won't get away.

823
01:13:42,401 --> 01:13:43,402
I tied the knots myself.

824
01:13:49,452 --> 01:13:52,019
Now you believe my
father's not The Wrecker.

825
01:13:52,063 --> 01:13:53,891
I never dreamed it was Jordan.

826
01:13:53,934 --> 01:13:54,848
Hurry, Gloria.

827
01:13:54,892 --> 01:13:56,502
We must warn the railroad.

828
01:13:56,546 --> 01:13:57,938
No.

829
01:13:57,982 --> 01:13:59,418
If we do that, they'll
never get The Wrecker.

830
01:13:59,462 --> 01:14:01,420
Larry Baker is the
one we must warn.

831
01:14:09,820 --> 01:14:11,909
They should be here
by this time, Larry.

832
01:14:11,952 --> 01:14:14,433
The Hurricane Express will
be along at any minute.

833
01:14:14,477 --> 01:14:16,827
Yeah.

834
01:14:16,870 --> 01:14:17,828
Here they come now.

835
01:14:17,871 --> 01:14:18,524
What?

836
01:14:35,628 --> 01:14:36,499
Look out, Sandy.

837
01:17:04,734 --> 01:17:06,344
What's the meaning
of this, Jordan?

838
01:17:06,387 --> 01:17:08,694
Why, The Wrecker struck me
down, and I think I got him.

839
01:17:08,738 --> 01:17:11,218
Then The Wrecker
is Gray, after all.

840
01:17:11,262 --> 01:17:12,219
No, he isn't.

841
01:17:12,263 --> 01:17:13,699
Walter Gray.

842
01:17:13,743 --> 01:17:15,571
Then The Wrecker's
wearing a mask.

843
01:17:19,226 --> 01:17:20,576
He's in bad shape.

844
01:17:20,619 --> 01:17:22,099
See if there's a doctor
on the train, Bill.

845
01:17:32,196 --> 01:17:33,589
Help me get this mask of him.

846
01:17:46,166 --> 01:17:50,127
Mr. Stevens— the Wrecker!

847
01:17:50,170 --> 01:17:52,129
You knew?

848
01:17:52,172 --> 01:17:54,087
Your father and I
discovered the truth today,

849
01:17:54,131 --> 01:17:55,741
but we had no proof.

850
01:17:55,785 --> 01:17:58,091
That's why your father returned
the gold to the railroad—

851
01:17:58,135 --> 01:17:59,266
to set a trap for Stevens.

852
01:18:14,499 --> 01:18:17,067
So you've got me, Matthews.

853
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:21,985
But you wouldn't have done it if
Baker hadn't— leave me alone.

854
01:18:22,028 --> 01:18:24,988
You can't do anything for me.

855
01:18:25,031 --> 01:18:28,513
I can't last very long.

856
01:18:34,127 --> 01:18:34,780
Dad.

857
01:18:38,828 --> 01:18:39,785
Stratton.

858
01:18:39,829 --> 01:18:41,395
Wait.

859
01:18:41,439 --> 01:18:44,007
Stratton's innocent.

860
01:18:44,050 --> 01:18:44,747
I framed him.

861
01:18:50,230 --> 01:18:53,277
I wanted to be
General Manager, so I

862
01:18:53,320 --> 01:18:56,193
plotted to get rid of Stratton.

863
01:18:56,236 --> 01:18:58,369
But the directors
gave Edwards the job,

864
01:18:58,412 --> 01:19:01,720
so I had to use other means.

865
01:19:01,764 --> 01:19:05,115
I've caused all
the wrecks in order

866
01:19:05,158 --> 01:19:09,162
to ruin the railroad so that I
could buy it at my own price.

867
01:19:09,206 --> 01:19:12,992
I wanted to use the gold
to finance my scheme.

868
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:20,521
I'm sorry, Stratton.

869
01:19:20,565 --> 01:19:21,435
And I hope—

870
01:19:34,231 --> 01:19:36,146
I congratulate you, Stratton.

871
01:19:36,189 --> 01:19:39,236
When you're back as General
Manager of the railroad,

872
01:19:39,279 --> 01:19:41,151
I hope we can get together
and merge our lines

873
01:19:41,194 --> 01:19:43,327
into a real transport
company, combining

874
01:19:43,370 --> 01:19:47,418
the best features of railroad
and air for our public service.

875
01:19:47,461 --> 01:19:51,422
And Larry, if you can forget
the rotten way I've treated you,

876
01:19:51,465 --> 01:19:54,294
I'd like to have your
back as chief pilot.

877
01:19:54,338 --> 01:19:57,297
Thank you, Mr. Gray.

878
01:19:57,341 --> 01:19:58,777
Get back to your job, Jordan.

879
01:19:58,821 --> 01:20:02,738
The Hurricane Express
must go through on time.
