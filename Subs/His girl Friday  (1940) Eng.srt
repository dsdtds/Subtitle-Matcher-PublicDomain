1
00:01:17,757 --> 00:01:18,757
Copy boy!

2
00:01:20,727 --> 00:01:23,662
- Make it snappy.
- Where's the rest of this story?

3
00:01:23,862 --> 00:01:25,091
<i>Morning Post.</i>

4
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:27,960
City desk? Just a moment
and I'll connect you.

5
00:01:28,268 --> 00:01:30,998
If anybody asks for me,
I'm down at the courthouse.

6
00:01:31,370 --> 00:01:33,305
- Elevator!
- Going down.

7
00:01:38,210 --> 00:01:40,610
- Hello, Hildy.
- Hi, Skinny.

8
00:01:40,813 --> 00:01:42,713
Hello, Ruth, Maisie.

9
00:01:43,515 --> 00:01:47,008
- Is the lord of the universe in?
- Yes, in a bad humor.

10
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,743
Somebody must've stolen
the crown jewel.

11
00:01:48,954 --> 00:01:51,423
- Shall we announce you?
- I'll blow my own horn.

12
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:54,783
Bruce, wait here.
I'll be back in ten minutes.

13
00:01:54,995 --> 00:01:58,328
Even ten minutes is a long time
to be away from you.

14
00:01:59,164 --> 00:02:00,597
What did you say?

15
00:02:03,135 --> 00:02:04,364
Go on.

16
00:02:05,537 --> 00:02:06,537
Well, go ahead.

17
00:02:06,706 --> 00:02:10,141
I just said, "Even ten minutes is
a long time to be away from you".

18
00:02:10,342 --> 00:02:14,278
I heard you. I like it.
That's why I asked you to say it again.

19
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,675
I like being spoiled.

20
00:02:15,882 --> 00:02:18,349
The man I'm going in to see
did little spoiling.

21
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:21,075
I'd like to spoil him.
Want me to go with you?

22
00:02:21,288 --> 00:02:23,687
- I can handle it.
- Lf it gets rough, I'm here.

23
00:02:23,889 --> 00:02:25,824
I'll come running, partner.

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,324
- Hello, Jim.
- Hello, Hildy!

25
00:02:28,627 --> 00:02:30,788
- How are you?
- Welcome back.

26
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,158
Hello, Hildy, how have you been?

27
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:37,198
Beatrice, how's
"Advice to the Lovelorn"?

28
00:02:37,403 --> 00:02:40,201
- Fine. My cat had kittens again.
- Your own fault.

29
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:42,737
Glad to see you. Hi, Jim.

30
00:02:42,942 --> 00:02:44,807
Mildred, you still around?

31
00:02:47,212 --> 00:02:49,204
A little more around the chin, boss.

32
00:02:49,848 --> 00:02:50,848
What do you want?

33
00:02:50,984 --> 00:02:52,918
Your ex-wife is here.

34
00:02:55,288 --> 00:02:56,721
Hello, Hildy.

35
00:02:56,923 --> 00:02:58,413
Hello, Walter.

36
00:02:59,359 --> 00:03:01,793
Hello, Louie.
How's the big slot machine king?

37
00:03:01,995 --> 00:03:05,361
I ain't doing that no more.
I'm retired. You know what I mean?

38
00:03:05,564 --> 00:03:07,259
- Walter.
- I'm busy!

39
00:03:08,501 --> 00:03:10,991
The governor didn't sign
that reprieve.

40
00:03:11,204 --> 00:03:14,264
Tomorrow, Earl Williams dies
and makes a sucker out of us.

41
00:03:15,508 --> 00:03:17,099
What are you going to do?

42
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,469
- Phone the governor.
- I can't.

43
00:03:18,677 --> 00:03:20,703
- Why not?
- He's out fishing.

44
00:03:20,913 --> 00:03:24,349
- How many places are there?
- At least two, Atlantic and Pacific.

45
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,143
That simplifies it, doesn't it?

46
00:03:26,353 --> 00:03:27,842
- Get him on the phone.
- And say what?

47
00:03:28,054 --> 00:03:30,112
Quiet, Duffy. He's thinking.

48
00:03:31,123 --> 00:03:34,320
Tell him if he reprieves Earl Williams,
we'll support him for senator.

49
00:03:34,526 --> 00:03:36,620
<i>Tell him the Morning Post
will be behind him.</i>

50
00:03:36,829 --> 00:03:37,921
- You can't do that.
- Why not?

51
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:40,531
We've been a Democratic paper
for over 20 years.

52
00:03:40,734 --> 00:03:43,725
After we get the reprieve,
we'll be Democratic again.

53
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:45,295
Go on, Duffy, get going.

54
00:03:45,504 --> 00:03:48,473
<i>The Morning Post expects
every editor to do his duty.</i>

55
00:03:48,675 --> 00:03:51,199
You too, Louie.
Get out of here.

56
00:03:55,981 --> 00:03:58,415
Well, Walter,
I see you're still at it.

57
00:03:58,617 --> 00:04:01,711
First time I double-crossed a governor.
What can I do for you?

58
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,616
Would you mind if I sat down?

59
00:04:03,823 --> 00:04:06,723
There's a lamp burning in the
window for you. Here.

60
00:04:06,925 --> 00:04:09,918
I jumped out of that window
a long time ago, Walter.

61
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:15,128
May I have one of those?

62
00:04:16,403 --> 00:04:17,461
Thank you.

63
00:04:20,072 --> 00:04:21,836
And a match?

64
00:04:22,475 --> 00:04:24,033
Thank you.

65
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,105
- How long is it?
- How long is what?

66
00:04:31,350 --> 00:04:32,408
You know what.

67
00:04:32,619 --> 00:04:34,985
How long is it since
we've seen each other?

68
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,947
Well, let's see.

69
00:04:38,158 --> 00:04:42,218
I spent six weeks in Reno,
then Bermuda. About four months.

70
00:04:42,428 --> 00:04:43,827
Seems like yesterday to me.

71
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:48,622
Maybe it was yesterday, Hildy.
Been seeing me in your dreams?

72
00:04:48,867 --> 00:04:51,927
Mama doesn't dream about you.
You wouldn't know her now.

73
00:04:52,137 --> 00:04:54,298
Yes, I would.
I'd know you anytime.

74
00:04:54,507 --> 00:04:56,600
Any place, anywhere.

75
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:59,778
You're repeating yourself.
You said that the night you proposed.

76
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:01,240
You still remember it.

77
00:05:01,447 --> 00:05:04,314
If I didn't remember it,
I wouldn't have divorced you.

78
00:05:04,516 --> 00:05:05,882
I sort of wish you hadn't.

79
00:05:06,084 --> 00:05:08,076
- What?
- Divorced me.

80
00:05:08,288 --> 00:05:11,154
It makes a fellow lose faith
in himself. It gives him...

81
00:05:11,356 --> 00:05:12,880
...a feeling he wasn't wanted.

82
00:05:13,091 --> 00:05:15,286
Junior, that's what divorces are for.

83
00:05:15,495 --> 00:05:18,759
Nonsense, you've got an old-fashioned
idea divorces last forever.

84
00:05:18,964 --> 00:05:22,423
"Till death do us part".
Divorce doesn't mean anything nowadays.

85
00:05:22,634 --> 00:05:25,194
Just a few words mumbled
over you by a judge.

86
00:05:25,404 --> 00:05:28,033
We've got something between us
nothing can change.

87
00:05:29,209 --> 00:05:32,007
- I suppose you're right in a way.
- Sure, I'm right.

88
00:05:32,211 --> 00:05:35,079
- I am fond of you, you know.
- Thattagirl!

89
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:37,771
I often wish you weren't
such a stinker.

90
00:05:39,084 --> 00:05:41,644
You must meet my mother.
She'd like that phrase.

91
00:05:41,855 --> 00:05:46,553
Then why'd you promise not to fight
the divorce and then gum up the works?

92
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:48,886
I meant to let you go,
but you know...

93
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,324
...you never miss the water
till the well runs dry.

94
00:05:51,531 --> 00:05:54,398
A big lummox like you,
hiring an airplane to write:

95
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,627
"Hildy, don't be hasty.
Remember my dimple. Walter".

96
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:01,329
It delayed our divorce
while the judge watched it.

97
00:06:01,540 --> 00:06:05,601
Not to brag, but I've still got
the dimple, and in the same place.

98
00:06:05,812 --> 00:06:08,975
I acted like any husband who didn't
want to see his home broken up.

99
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:11,911
- What home?
- Remember the home I promised you?

100
00:06:12,117 --> 00:06:16,019
Sure I do. The one we were to
have right after the honeymoon.

101
00:06:16,221 --> 00:06:17,483
That honeymoon!

102
00:06:17,689 --> 00:06:21,182
Was it my fault? Did I know that
coal mine would have a cave-in?

103
00:06:21,394 --> 00:06:24,158
I intended to be with you
on our honeymoon.

104
00:06:24,363 --> 00:06:27,629
Instead of two weeks in Atlantic City
with my bridegroom...

105
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:30,927
...I spent two weeks in a coal mine
with John Kruptzky.

106
00:06:31,137 --> 00:06:32,137
You don't deny it?

107
00:06:32,237 --> 00:06:35,139
No. We beat the whole country
on that story!

108
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:38,310
Suppose we did!
That isn't what I got married for!

109
00:06:38,511 --> 00:06:40,774
What is the good?
Look, Walter.

110
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:45,211
I came to tell you to stop
phoning me a dozen times a day...

111
00:06:45,418 --> 00:06:46,418
...sending me 20 telegrams...

112
00:06:46,619 --> 00:06:48,711
I write a beautiful telegram, don't I?

113
00:06:48,922 --> 00:06:50,389
Are you going to listen?

114
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:53,218
What's the use of fighting?
I'll tell you what you do.

115
00:06:53,425 --> 00:06:56,759
Come back to work on the paper,
and if we can't get along...

116
00:06:56,963 --> 00:06:58,759
...we'll get married again.

117
00:06:58,965 --> 00:07:01,728
- What?
- Sure, I haven't any hard feelings.

118
00:07:01,935 --> 00:07:05,132
Walter, you're wonderful
in a loathsome sort of way.

119
00:07:05,338 --> 00:07:08,603
- Be quiet so I can say what I have to.
- Tell me over lunch.

120
00:07:08,774 --> 00:07:10,298
I have a lunch date.

121
00:07:10,509 --> 00:07:11,636
- Break it.
- I can't.

122
00:07:11,843 --> 00:07:13,869
Hands off!
Are you playing osteopath?

123
00:07:14,079 --> 00:07:15,307
Temper, temper.

124
00:07:15,514 --> 00:07:19,814
You are no longer my husband
and no longer my boss.

125
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:21,350
And you won't be my boss.

126
00:07:21,553 --> 00:07:23,954
- What does that mean?
- Just what I say.

127
00:07:24,156 --> 00:07:25,749
You're not coming back to work?

128
00:07:25,959 --> 00:07:28,427
You're right for
the first time today.

129
00:07:29,362 --> 00:07:31,125
- Got a better offer?
- You bet!

130
00:07:31,331 --> 00:07:34,391
Work for somebody else!
That's the gratitude I get.

131
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,625
Stop hamming.

132
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:39,930
Five years ago, you were a college girl.
I took a doll-faced hick!

133
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,697
You wouldn't have
if I wasn't doll-faced.

134
00:07:41,908 --> 00:07:45,308
It was a novelty to have a face
to look at without shuddering.

135
00:07:45,511 --> 00:07:49,072
I made you a great reporter.
You won't be as good on any other paper.

136
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:52,115
We're a team.
The paper needs both of us!

137
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:53,784
Sold American!

138
00:07:53,987 --> 00:07:56,649
- All right, go ahead.
- Listen, Walter, please.

139
00:07:56,855 --> 00:08:00,291
The paper's going to have to get along
without me. So will you.

140
00:08:00,492 --> 00:08:01,653
It didn't work out.

141
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:05,819
It would have worked if you'd been
satisfied as editor and reporter.

142
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:08,091
You had to marry me
and spoil everything.

143
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:11,463
I wasn't satisfied?
I suppose I proposed to you!

144
00:08:11,704 --> 00:08:14,434
Practically!
Making eyes at me until I broke down.

145
00:08:14,641 --> 00:08:18,076
"Oh, Walter!"
I was tight when I proposed to you.

146
00:08:18,276 --> 00:08:21,040
If you'd been a gentleman,
you'd have forgotten about it.

147
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,646
You used to pitch better than that.

148
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,817
Hello. What?

149
00:08:26,019 --> 00:08:28,009
Sweeney? What can I do for you?

150
00:08:28,221 --> 00:08:30,985
What? Wait a minute.
I'm not Sweeney. I'm Duffy.

151
00:08:31,223 --> 00:08:34,158
Sweeney, you can't do that to me.
Not today, of all days!

152
00:08:34,527 --> 00:08:36,721
What's the matter with you?
Are you a loony?

153
00:08:37,764 --> 00:08:40,892
Now, listen, Sweeney.
This is no time...

154
00:08:42,368 --> 00:08:47,067
All right, I suppose so.
If you have to, you have to.

155
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:49,639
- He had to.
- Everything happens to me.

156
00:08:49,841 --> 00:08:52,970
365 days in a year,
and this has to be the day.

157
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:54,178
What's wrong?

158
00:08:54,246 --> 00:08:55,475
- Sweeney.
- Dead?

159
00:08:55,682 --> 00:08:59,345
He might as well be.
He picks today to have a baby!

160
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:00,813
Not on purpose?

161
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:04,182
He's supposed to cover the
Earl Williams case, and where is he?

162
00:09:04,389 --> 00:09:07,518
Walking up and down in a hospital.
Is there no honor?

163
00:09:07,726 --> 00:09:09,318
Haven't you got anybody else?

164
00:09:10,296 --> 00:09:12,456
Nobody else on the paper can write.

165
00:09:12,664 --> 00:09:13,825
This'll break me.

166
00:09:14,033 --> 00:09:15,033
Unless...

167
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,357
Hildy!

168
00:09:17,003 --> 00:09:19,528
- You've got to help me.
- Not a chance, Walter.

169
00:09:19,739 --> 00:09:21,297
Get out of here, Duffy!

170
00:09:21,506 --> 00:09:22,506
Save your breath.

171
00:09:22,542 --> 00:09:24,338
This'll bring us back together again.

172
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,341
That's what I'm afraid of.

173
00:09:26,546 --> 00:09:28,673
This is bigger than anything else.

174
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,880
Do it for the paper.

175
00:09:30,082 --> 00:09:31,174
Scram, Svengali.

176
00:09:31,384 --> 00:09:33,544
If you won't do it for love,
how about money?

177
00:09:33,753 --> 00:09:35,220
I'll raise you $25 a week.

178
00:09:35,421 --> 00:09:36,786
Listen to me, you baboon...

179
00:09:36,989 --> 00:09:38,751
I'll make it $35
and not a cent more.

180
00:09:38,957 --> 00:09:40,118
Listen!

181
00:09:40,326 --> 00:09:41,816
How much will the other paper pay?

182
00:09:42,028 --> 00:09:43,086
There's no other paper.

183
00:09:43,296 --> 00:09:46,322
Then the raise is off.
You go back to your old salary.

184
00:09:46,532 --> 00:09:48,260
Trying to blackjack me.

185
00:09:48,467 --> 00:09:50,059
- I'm busy.
- Take a good look at it.

186
00:09:50,269 --> 00:09:53,033
Do you know what it is?
It's an engagement ring.

187
00:09:55,975 --> 00:09:57,601
Engagement ring?

188
00:10:00,613 --> 00:10:02,604
I tried to tell you right away...

189
00:10:02,815 --> 00:10:04,908
...but you would start reminiscing.

190
00:10:05,384 --> 00:10:08,011
I'm getting married,
and I'm getting as far away...

191
00:10:08,221 --> 00:10:10,849
...from the newspaper business
as I can get.

192
00:10:12,390 --> 00:10:13,585
I'm through.

193
00:10:13,793 --> 00:10:17,091
- You can get married, but not quit.
- No? Why not?

194
00:10:17,296 --> 00:10:18,923
I know what quitting would mean.

195
00:10:19,131 --> 00:10:21,032
- What?
- It would kill you.

196
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:24,533
- You can't sell me that.
- You're a newspaperman.

197
00:10:24,736 --> 00:10:27,432
I want to go someplace
where I can be a woman.

198
00:10:27,639 --> 00:10:29,870
- You mean, be a traitor.
- A traitor to what?

199
00:10:30,076 --> 00:10:31,941
To journalism.
You're a journalist!

200
00:10:32,144 --> 00:10:34,510
A journalist?
What does that mean?

201
00:10:34,713 --> 00:10:37,477
Peeking through keyholes,
chasing fire engines...

202
00:10:37,682 --> 00:10:40,277
...waking people up
in the night to ask questions...

203
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:43,977
...stealing pictures off old ladies?
I know all about reporters.

204
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,851
Buttinskies running around
with no money, and for what?

205
00:10:47,058 --> 00:10:51,654
So a million people will know
what's going on. Why, I...

206
00:10:51,864 --> 00:10:53,729
What's the use?

207
00:10:53,932 --> 00:10:56,197
Walter, you wouldn't know
what it means...

208
00:10:56,402 --> 00:11:00,337
...to want to be respectable and
live a halfway normal life.

209
00:11:01,274 --> 00:11:04,243
The point is, I'm through.

210
00:11:05,845 --> 00:11:07,710
Where did you meet this man?

211
00:11:07,913 --> 00:11:08,913
Bermuda.

212
00:11:09,014 --> 00:11:10,106
Rich?

213
00:11:10,316 --> 00:11:13,774
He's not what you'd call rich.
He makes about $5000 a year.

214
00:11:13,985 --> 00:11:16,648
- What's his line?
- He's in the insurance business.

215
00:11:16,855 --> 00:11:18,447
Insurance business?

216
00:11:18,658 --> 00:11:20,057
That's a good honest business.

217
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:23,193
Sure, it's honest.
It's also adventurous, romantic.

218
00:11:23,395 --> 00:11:26,888
I can't picture you
being surrounded by policies...

219
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:29,897
I can, and I like it, what's more.

220
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:32,536
Besides, he forgets the office
when he's with me.

221
00:11:32,738 --> 00:11:34,706
He doesn't treat me
like an errand boy.

222
00:11:34,907 --> 00:11:36,067
He treats me like a woman.

223
00:11:36,274 --> 00:11:39,210
He does? How did I treat you?
Like a water buffalo?

224
00:11:39,412 --> 00:11:42,278
I don't know from buffaloes,
but I do know about him.

225
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,711
He's kind, he's sweet,
and he's considerate.

226
00:11:44,917 --> 00:11:46,942
He wants a home and children.

227
00:11:47,153 --> 00:11:49,849
Sounds like a guy I ought to marry.
What's his name?

228
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,054
Baldwin. Bruce Baldwin.

229
00:11:52,258 --> 00:11:54,317
I knew a Baldwin once,
a horse thief.

230
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:56,427
Couldn't be the same fellow,
could it?

231
00:11:56,629 --> 00:12:00,086
You are not talking about the man
I'm marrying tomorrow.

232
00:12:01,234 --> 00:12:03,566
Tomorrow? As soon as that?

233
00:12:08,374 --> 00:12:12,037
At last, I got out what
I came up here to tell you.

234
00:12:13,379 --> 00:12:15,846
Guess there isn't any more
to the story.

235
00:12:16,782 --> 00:12:18,043
So long, Walter.

236
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,548
So long, Hildy.

237
00:12:19,751 --> 00:12:21,379
Better luck to you next time.

238
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:23,178
Thanks.

239
00:12:27,894 --> 00:12:31,260
Well, you kind of took
the wind out of my sail.

240
00:12:31,463 --> 00:12:35,126
I just want to wish you
everything I couldn't give you.

241
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:41,765
This other fellow. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to see him.

242
00:12:41,974 --> 00:12:45,171
I'm particular about
whom my wife marries.

243
00:12:45,443 --> 00:12:46,672
Where is he?

244
00:12:46,879 --> 00:12:50,042
He's right on the job,
waiting for me out there.

245
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:52,114
Do you mind if I meet him?

246
00:12:52,317 --> 00:12:55,378
- It wouldn't do any good.
- You're not afraid, are you?

247
00:12:55,587 --> 00:12:56,587
Of course not.

248
00:12:56,755 --> 00:13:00,452
Let's see this paragon.
Is he as good as you say?

249
00:13:00,659 --> 00:13:01,659
He's better.

250
00:13:01,793 --> 00:13:03,955
- Then what does he want with you?
- You got me.

251
00:13:04,562 --> 00:13:06,154
Back in an hour, Mildred.

252
00:13:06,365 --> 00:13:09,596
I am sorry, Hildy.
I suppose Bruce... What's his name?

253
00:13:09,802 --> 00:13:11,269
I suppose he opens doors for you?

254
00:13:11,470 --> 00:13:13,734
And with a lady,
he takes his hat off.

255
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,304
I am sorry.

256
00:13:15,573 --> 00:13:17,633
When he walks with a lady,
he waits for her.

257
00:13:17,842 --> 00:13:20,038
In that case...

258
00:13:21,746 --> 00:13:23,111
Allow me.

259
00:13:25,985 --> 00:13:29,351
I can see my wife picked out
the right husband for herself.

260
00:13:30,389 --> 00:13:33,085
There must be some mistake.
I'm already married.

261
00:13:33,292 --> 00:13:34,850
Already married?

262
00:13:36,528 --> 00:13:37,722
You should have told me.

263
00:13:37,929 --> 00:13:39,794
Congratulations again, Mr. Baldwin.

264
00:13:39,999 --> 00:13:41,125
- No, my name...
- Mr. Burns.

265
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:44,235
I'm terribly busy.
What did you say, Mr. Baldwin?

266
00:13:44,437 --> 00:13:46,200
- Mr. Burns.
- My name is...

267
00:13:46,404 --> 00:13:49,567
I'm busy with Mr. Baldwin.
I didn't hear what you said, sir.

268
00:13:49,774 --> 00:13:51,436
- My name is...
- Mr. Burns...

269
00:13:51,644 --> 00:13:53,634
- What is it with you?
- I'm Bruce Baldwin.

270
00:13:53,846 --> 00:13:56,144
Can't you see that I'm...
You're Bruce Baldwin!

271
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:57,782
Well, who is he?
Who are you?

272
00:13:57,984 --> 00:13:59,610
My name's Pete Davis.

273
00:13:59,818 --> 00:14:02,253
Mr. Davis, is this
any concern of yours?

274
00:14:02,455 --> 00:14:04,946
From now on, keep your nose
out of my affairs.

275
00:14:05,157 --> 00:14:06,919
Don't let it happen again.

276
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:11,255
I'm terribly sorry about this mistake.
This is indeed a pleasure.

277
00:14:11,464 --> 00:14:15,594
That's wrong, isn't it? Bruce...
do you mind if I call you Bruce?

278
00:14:15,835 --> 00:14:18,530
- We're almost related.
- No, not at all.

279
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:21,206
You see, my wife...
That is, your wife.

280
00:14:21,407 --> 00:14:24,740
Hildy, you led me to expect you
were marrying a much older man.

281
00:14:24,943 --> 00:14:26,808
What did I say?

282
00:14:27,013 --> 00:14:31,005
Don't worry about it. I realize
you didn't mean old in years.

283
00:14:31,984 --> 00:14:35,350
- Do you always carry an umbrella?
- It looked cloudy this morning.

284
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,384
That's right.
Rubbers too, I hope.

285
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:40,780
Thattaboy!
A man ought to be prepared.

286
00:14:40,993 --> 00:14:42,460
We'd better run along.

287
00:14:42,661 --> 00:14:44,423
- We'd better go.
- Where are we going?

288
00:14:44,629 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm taking you two to lunch.
Didn't you tell him?

289
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:48,094
No, she didn't.

290
00:14:48,299 --> 00:14:51,667
I guess she just wanted
to surprise you, Bruce.

291
00:14:51,870 --> 00:14:52,870
After you, Hildy.

292
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:54,836
You're wasting your time.

293
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:57,600
No, I'm glad to do it.

294
00:15:01,514 --> 00:15:03,004
Hello, Gus.

295
00:15:03,215 --> 00:15:04,375
It's Hildy!

296
00:15:04,582 --> 00:15:06,278
It's none other.
How are things?

297
00:15:06,485 --> 00:15:07,509
I can't complain.

298
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,745
I can. I'm hungry.
A roast beef sandwich...

299
00:15:09,955 --> 00:15:11,479
- Sorry.
- ...on white bread.

300
00:15:11,690 --> 00:15:13,020
Over there, Bruce.

301
00:15:13,225 --> 00:15:15,455
- And you, Hildy?
- I'll have the same.

302
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:18,221
- And you, sir?
- Yes, that's all right for me.

303
00:15:18,431 --> 00:15:20,956
Bring some mustard too, Gus.

304
00:15:23,501 --> 00:15:25,868
So you two are going to get married?

305
00:15:26,072 --> 00:15:28,870
- How does it feel, Bruce?
- It feels awful good.

306
00:15:29,075 --> 00:15:30,599
You're getting a great girl.

307
00:15:30,809 --> 00:15:32,243
I realize that.

308
00:15:32,445 --> 00:15:34,639
Things have been different
since I met Hildy.

309
00:15:34,846 --> 00:15:37,076
I've never met anyone quite like her.

310
00:15:37,283 --> 00:15:39,080
Everybody else I've ever known...

311
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:43,153
...you could always tell ahead of time
what they would say or do.

312
00:15:43,355 --> 00:15:47,086
But Hildy's not like that.
You can't tell that about her.

313
00:15:47,293 --> 00:15:48,418
That's nice.

314
00:15:48,626 --> 00:15:51,288
You're getting something else too:
A great newspaperman.

315
00:15:51,496 --> 00:15:52,793
No orchids, Walter.

316
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:56,729
One of the best I ever knew.
Sorry to see her go. Darn sorry.

317
00:15:56,936 --> 00:15:58,528
I'd like to believe you.

318
00:15:58,736 --> 00:16:01,205
I mean it.
If you ever want to come back...

319
00:16:01,407 --> 00:16:03,033
Which I won't.

320
00:16:03,241 --> 00:16:06,609
In spite of everything,
there's only one man I'd work for.

321
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:08,972
I'd kill you if you
worked for anybody else.

322
00:16:09,181 --> 00:16:10,841
Hear that? That's my diploma.

323
00:16:11,049 --> 00:16:13,677
It must be quite a business if it's...

324
00:16:13,885 --> 00:16:15,682
Are you sure you want to quit?

325
00:16:15,921 --> 00:16:17,182
What do you mean?

326
00:16:17,389 --> 00:16:19,049
If there is any doubt about it...

327
00:16:19,258 --> 00:16:20,657
...or if there's anything...

328
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,054
No, this is your chance
to have a home...

329
00:16:23,261 --> 00:16:25,594
...and to be, like you said,
a human being.

330
00:16:25,798 --> 00:16:27,230
I'll make you take that chance.

331
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:30,027
Certainly.
Why, I wouldn't let her stay.

332
00:16:30,235 --> 00:16:34,570
She deserves all this happiness.
All the things I couldn't give her.

333
00:16:34,773 --> 00:16:36,433
All she ever wanted was a home.

334
00:16:36,642 --> 00:16:38,438
I'll certainly try.

335
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:39,837
I know you will, Bruce.

336
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:41,307
- Where will you live?
- Albany.

337
00:16:41,514 --> 00:16:44,482
- Got a family up there?
- Just my mother.

338
00:16:44,682 --> 00:16:47,207
Just your mother.
You're going to live with her?

339
00:16:47,418 --> 00:16:49,511
Just for the first year.

340
00:16:49,721 --> 00:16:50,950
That will be nice.

341
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:54,923
Yes, a home with mother,
in Albany too.

342
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:58,755
Mighty nice little town.
It's the state capital.

343
00:16:58,963 --> 00:17:01,797
I know. We were there once.

344
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:08,869
Will you ever forget the night
you brought the governor to the hotel?

345
00:17:09,074 --> 00:17:11,269
You see, I was in taking a bath.

346
00:17:11,477 --> 00:17:14,001
Well, I came walking out without...

347
00:17:15,881 --> 00:17:17,780
She didn't know I was in town.

348
00:17:17,982 --> 00:17:21,009
Bruce, how is business up there?
Any better?

349
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:23,313
Albany's a mighty
good insurance town.

350
00:17:23,521 --> 00:17:25,887
Most people take it out
pretty early in life.

351
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:27,955
I can see why they would.

352
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,718
Statistics show that most of...

353
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:33,365
I've got a feeling I ought to
have taken out a little insurance.

354
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:36,592
That really doesn't matter
now that Hildy and I have...

355
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:39,302
...well, you know, we've...
Does it?

356
00:17:39,505 --> 00:17:40,869
What do you think?

357
00:17:41,073 --> 00:17:44,201
It might have been a good idea
if I had taken out insurance.

358
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:46,037
I honestly feel that way.

359
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:48,906
I'm in one business
that really helps people.

360
00:17:49,114 --> 00:17:52,378
Of course, we don't help you much
while you're alive, but afterward.

361
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:55,144
- That's what counts.
- Sure.

362
00:17:55,988 --> 00:17:57,318
I don't get it.

363
00:17:58,523 --> 00:17:59,523
Nice going.

364
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,888
So sorry, Gus.
My foot must have slipped.

365
00:18:02,094 --> 00:18:04,392
That's all right.
What would you like to drink?

366
00:18:04,596 --> 00:18:05,596
Coffee.

367
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,861
- Shall I put some rum in the coffee?
- Sure.

368
00:18:08,067 --> 00:18:09,500
Me too, Gus, please.

369
00:18:09,835 --> 00:18:11,426
- Not for me.
- Go on, Bruce.

370
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:15,232
I have a lot to do. I have to
buy the tickets, check the baggage...

371
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,602
Do it tomorrow.

372
00:18:16,809 --> 00:18:20,836
We're leaving today at four o'clock,
taking the sleeper for Albany.

373
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:25,682
You're leaving today
at four o'clock?

374
00:18:25,884 --> 00:18:28,285
- That's only two hours.
- That's not much time.

375
00:18:28,488 --> 00:18:30,182
I've got a lot to do.
I want to...

376
00:18:30,390 --> 00:18:33,222
Isn't that silly?
All down over my front.

377
00:18:33,425 --> 00:18:36,486
- That's nothing new. Here.
- Never mind, I'll get Gus.

378
00:18:36,695 --> 00:18:38,960
Gus, do something
about this, will you?

379
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:41,962
Call me to the telephone when
I get back to the table.

380
00:18:42,167 --> 00:18:44,761
Thanks, Gus, that's fine.

381
00:18:44,971 --> 00:18:47,905
I'm terribly sorry about that.
That was silly, wasn't it?

382
00:18:48,107 --> 00:18:51,305
Let me get that straight.
I must have misunderstood you.

383
00:18:51,510 --> 00:18:54,809
You're taking the sleeper today,
then getting married tomorrow?

384
00:18:55,015 --> 00:18:57,107
Well, it's not like that.

385
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,317
What is it like?

386
00:18:58,518 --> 00:19:00,509
Poor Walter.
He'll toss and turn all night.

387
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,211
Perhaps we'd better tell him.
Mother's coming too.

388
00:19:03,423 --> 00:19:05,253
Your mother kicked the bucket...

389
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,617
No, my mother.

390
00:19:06,826 --> 00:19:09,420
Your mother?
Well, that relieves my mind.

391
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,493
It was cruel to let you suffer so.

392
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:14,132
Isn't Walter sweet?
Always wanting to protect me.

393
00:19:14,334 --> 00:19:17,791
I admit I wasn't much of a husband,
but you can always count on me.

394
00:19:18,003 --> 00:19:21,872
I don't think she'll need you much.
I aim to do the protecting myself.

395
00:19:22,075 --> 00:19:23,872
Mr. Burns, telephone.

396
00:19:24,076 --> 00:19:25,305
For me?

397
00:19:25,511 --> 00:19:26,808
That's strange.

398
00:19:27,314 --> 00:19:28,576
Pardon me.

399
00:19:31,084 --> 00:19:32,813
He's not such a bad fellow.

400
00:19:33,086 --> 00:19:35,987
No, he should make
some girl real happy.

401
00:19:36,189 --> 00:19:37,247
Slaphappy.

402
00:19:38,191 --> 00:19:40,385
He's not the man for you.
I can see that.

403
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:42,753
But I sort of like him.
He's got charm.

404
00:19:42,961 --> 00:19:45,896
He comes by it naturally.
His grandfather was a snake.

405
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,560
Hello? Duffy, listen.

406
00:19:50,769 --> 00:19:53,704
Any way we can stop the 4:00 train
to Albany from leaving?

407
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:56,432
<i>- We might dynamite it.
- Could we?</i>

408
00:19:56,643 --> 00:19:58,508
Maybe we couldn't.

409
00:19:58,711 --> 00:19:59,769
All right, get this.

410
00:19:59,979 --> 00:20:03,642
Send Sweeney out of town on
two weeks' vacation right away.

411
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:06,785
Keep your shirt on.
Hildy's coming back.

412
00:20:06,986 --> 00:20:09,317
She doesn't know it yet,
but she's staying.

413
00:20:09,521 --> 00:20:13,288
Tell Louie to stick around the office.
I may need him. Goodbye.

414
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,288
Thanks, Gus.

415
00:20:16,496 --> 00:20:18,395
- This is bad business.
- What's the matter?

416
00:20:18,597 --> 00:20:19,929
The Earl Williams case.

417
00:20:20,133 --> 00:20:21,566
I've been reading about that.

418
00:20:21,768 --> 00:20:22,768
It's pretty bad.

419
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,929
- What is the lowdown on it?
- Simple, honey.

420
00:20:25,137 --> 00:20:27,935
Poor little dope lost his job,
went berserk and shot a cop...

421
00:20:28,141 --> 00:20:30,701
...who was coming to quiet him down.
They'll hang him tomorrow.

422
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:31,933
What a shame.

423
00:20:32,144 --> 00:20:34,375
Your paper has been taking his side.

424
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,981
If he was out of his mind, why doesn't
the state just put him away?

425
00:20:38,183 --> 00:20:41,346
Because it was a colored policeman.
You know what that means.

426
00:20:41,554 --> 00:20:43,145
The colored vote's important.

427
00:20:43,355 --> 00:20:45,414
Especially with an election
in three or four days.

428
00:20:45,625 --> 00:20:48,287
That mayor would hang his
grandmother to be reelected.

429
00:20:48,494 --> 00:20:50,690
You could show the man
wasn't responsible.

430
00:20:50,896 --> 00:20:52,296
That's not so easy.

431
00:20:52,766 --> 00:20:54,858
Maybe it isn't so hard either.

432
00:20:55,067 --> 00:20:56,535
What do you mean, Hildy?

433
00:20:56,736 --> 00:20:59,397
Doesn't an expert have to
examine him before they hang him?

434
00:20:59,605 --> 00:21:02,665
A bird named Egelhoffer is doing it.
He'll say the same as the rest.

435
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:04,036
Suppose he does.

436
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:05,268
What's your scheme?

437
00:21:05,478 --> 00:21:08,071
Walter, you get the interview
with Earl Williams.

438
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,713
Print Egelhoffer's statement.

439
00:21:09,915 --> 00:21:13,477
And right alongside it, double column,
run your interview.

440
00:21:13,685 --> 00:21:16,119
Alienist says he's sane.
Interview shows he's goofy.

441
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:18,789
You could save that poor devil's life.

442
00:21:18,991 --> 00:21:20,152
You could...

443
00:21:21,260 --> 00:21:24,320
- You're going away. I forgot.
- How long would the interview take?

444
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:26,931
An hour for the interview.
An hour to write it.

445
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:30,465
We could take the 6 o'clock train
if it'd save a man's life.

446
00:21:30,670 --> 00:21:33,695
No, Bruce. If you want to save
Earl Williams' life...

447
00:21:33,906 --> 00:21:36,171
...write it yourself.
You're a good reporter.

448
00:21:36,375 --> 00:21:39,641
I can't write that kind of thing.
It takes a woman's touch.

449
00:21:39,846 --> 00:21:41,746
Don't get poetic.
Get Sweeney.

450
00:21:41,948 --> 00:21:44,439
He's the best man for that
sob-sister stuff.

451
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:48,246
Poor Sweeney. Duffy just told me
his wife finally had twins.

452
00:21:48,454 --> 00:21:49,454
Isn't that terrible?

453
00:21:49,655 --> 00:21:52,021
Sweeney went out to celebrate
and now we can't find him.

454
00:21:52,224 --> 00:21:54,750
So Sweeney has twins
and Williams gets hanged.

455
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:56,121
Now, Walter, look.

456
00:21:56,328 --> 00:22:00,059
Argue with her, or you'll be on
a honeymoon with blood on your hands.

457
00:22:00,266 --> 00:22:02,028
How can you be happy after that?

458
00:22:02,234 --> 00:22:04,964
You'll remember that
a man went to the gallows...

459
00:22:05,171 --> 00:22:07,365
...because she was too selfish
to wait two hours.

460
00:22:07,574 --> 00:22:10,372
Earl Williams' face will come
between you tonight...

461
00:22:10,576 --> 00:22:12,306
...and the rest of your life.

462
00:22:12,511 --> 00:22:14,945
Stop it, Walter.
The whole place will hear you.

463
00:22:15,147 --> 00:22:16,740
What an act.

464
00:22:16,950 --> 00:22:20,750
I just remembered Sweeney was only
married four months ago.

465
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:26,721
Hildy, you win. I'm licked.

466
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,792
Then Mrs. Sweeney didn't have twins?

467
00:22:29,996 --> 00:22:32,759
No, indeed. The twins were
Walter's, all his.

468
00:22:32,965 --> 00:22:34,626
It was nothing.

469
00:22:34,834 --> 00:22:36,357
Well, come on, let's forget it.

470
00:22:36,568 --> 00:22:37,830
We'll start over again.

471
00:22:38,037 --> 00:22:39,971
- I'll offer a business proposition.
- Not interested.

472
00:22:40,173 --> 00:22:41,503
You'll be interested.

473
00:22:41,708 --> 00:22:43,699
Don't listen to him.
I know him from way back.

474
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,811
Excuse me, will you? I'm talking
to him. Now, look, Bruce...

475
00:22:48,013 --> 00:22:51,506
...persuade her and you can
write an insurance policy for me.

476
00:22:51,718 --> 00:22:54,914
No, Mr. Burns. I wouldn't use
my wife for business purposes.

477
00:22:55,121 --> 00:22:56,348
Wait a minute, Bruce.

478
00:22:57,089 --> 00:22:58,647
- How big a policy?
- 25,000.

479
00:22:58,857 --> 00:22:59,857
Fifty thousand.

480
00:23:00,026 --> 00:23:01,653
What's the commission on
a $100,000 policy?

481
00:23:01,861 --> 00:23:04,454
- Around $1000, but Hildy...
- And what's wrong with $1000?

482
00:23:04,663 --> 00:23:06,290
- I couldn't...
- We could use that money.

483
00:23:06,499 --> 00:23:08,057
How long would it take
to get him examined?

484
00:23:08,268 --> 00:23:10,236
I could get a company doctor
here in 20 minutes.

485
00:23:10,435 --> 00:23:12,563
- Get him. Get him.
- You keep out of this.

486
00:23:12,771 --> 00:23:15,900
Suppose you have Mr. Burns examined
over in his office...

487
00:23:16,108 --> 00:23:18,838
...and see what they'll allow
on that old carcass of his.

488
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:22,502
- I'm better than I ever was.
- That's nothing to brag about.

489
00:23:22,714 --> 00:23:26,616
I'll go back and change and after
you get the check, phone me.

490
00:23:26,818 --> 00:23:29,252
I'll be in the press room
at the criminal courts building.

491
00:23:29,454 --> 00:23:33,016
Oh, Walter? I think you better
make that a certified check.

492
00:23:33,226 --> 00:23:34,317
Think I'm a crook?

493
00:23:34,527 --> 00:23:36,757
Yes. No certified check,
no story. Get me?

494
00:23:36,962 --> 00:23:38,362
It'll be certified.
Want my fingerprints?

495
00:23:38,565 --> 00:23:40,123
No, thanks. I've still got those.

496
00:23:40,333 --> 00:23:42,267
Gus, how much do I owe you?

497
00:23:43,336 --> 00:23:44,769
Thank you, dear.

498
00:23:45,939 --> 00:23:48,270
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- How much money have you got?

499
00:23:48,473 --> 00:23:50,305
You know, everything we have, $500.

500
00:23:50,509 --> 00:23:52,340
- Give me it.
- I have to buy the tickets.

501
00:23:52,545 --> 00:23:55,980
I'll buy the tickets. Believe me,
he'll get you in a crap game.

502
00:23:56,182 --> 00:23:57,410
Hildy, I don't gamble.

503
00:23:57,616 --> 00:24:01,211
I know people that never did anything
till they met Walter Burns.

504
00:24:01,421 --> 00:24:03,945
But remember, it's everything we have.

505
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:05,156
I know.

506
00:24:05,758 --> 00:24:08,692
- You got change of ten?
- See what I mean, don't you, Bruce?

507
00:24:08,894 --> 00:24:11,420
I just gave everything to Hildy.
All I've got left...

508
00:24:11,631 --> 00:24:13,461
- Come on, Hildy.
- Not me. Sign it.

509
00:24:13,665 --> 00:24:15,258
All right.

510
00:24:17,103 --> 00:24:18,626
For the waiter.

511
00:24:19,204 --> 00:24:21,195
Come on, Bruce. Really.

512
00:24:24,743 --> 00:24:25,768
I'll open for a dime.

513
00:24:25,979 --> 00:24:26,979
I'm in.

514
00:24:27,145 --> 00:24:28,306
I'll stay.

515
00:24:28,513 --> 00:24:30,003
Wilcox 3400.

516
00:24:30,215 --> 00:24:31,648
- How many?
- Two.

517
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,111
Take that, one of you birds.
You ain't doing anything, Ernie.

518
00:24:36,623 --> 00:24:39,285
What's the matter with you guys?
Crippled or something?

519
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:40,856
I'll just bet 20 cents.

520
00:24:41,059 --> 00:24:43,118
Press room. Wait a minute.

521
00:24:43,328 --> 00:24:46,457
Hello, Sarge, McCue talking.
Hold the line, will you? What?

522
00:24:46,665 --> 00:24:49,794
I told you this is the press room
of the criminal courts building.

523
00:24:50,002 --> 00:24:51,527
Jake, new lead on the hanging.

524
00:24:51,738 --> 00:24:55,173
This alienist from New York,
Dr. Max J. Egelhoffer.

525
00:24:55,375 --> 00:24:59,105
He's interviewing Williams in about
half an hour in the sheriff's office.

526
00:24:59,311 --> 00:25:01,609
Must be the tenth alienist
they've put on Williams.

527
00:25:01,814 --> 00:25:03,679
If he wasn't crazy,
he would be by the time...

528
00:25:03,883 --> 00:25:06,715
...ten of those babies got through
psychoanalyzing him.

529
00:25:06,919 --> 00:25:09,451
- Is this guy Egelhoffer any good?
- You figure it out.

530
00:25:09,655 --> 00:25:12,989
He's the guy they sent to Washington
to interview the Brain Trust.

531
00:25:13,192 --> 00:25:14,659
He said they were sane.

532
00:25:14,861 --> 00:25:16,521
Here's the situation
on the eve of the hanging.

533
00:25:16,729 --> 00:25:20,797
I'll pick up a little fudge. This is Murphy.
More slop on the hanging.

534
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,730
A double guard has been thrown around
the jail, municipal buildings...

535
00:25:23,935 --> 00:25:25,528
...railroad terminals,
and elevated stations...

536
00:25:25,738 --> 00:25:27,830
...to prepare for the expected
general uprising...

537
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:29,837
...of radicals at the hour of execution.

538
00:25:30,042 --> 00:25:32,636
The sheriff has put 200 more
relatives on the payroll...

539
00:25:32,845 --> 00:25:34,675
...to protect the city
from the Red Army...

540
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:37,144
...which is leaving Moscow
in a couple of minutes.

541
00:25:37,349 --> 00:25:39,250
Trouble is, when the real Red Menace
shows up...

542
00:25:39,451 --> 00:25:42,215
...the sheriff will still be
crying wolf. What do you got?

543
00:25:42,422 --> 00:25:44,515
- Is that good?
- Sure looks good from here.

544
00:25:44,723 --> 00:25:46,919
Hildy, when did you get back?

545
00:25:47,125 --> 00:25:48,490
- How are you, Eddie?
- Glad to see you.

546
00:25:48,694 --> 00:25:50,458
- Glad to see you.
- Where'd you get the hat?

547
00:25:50,663 --> 00:25:53,222
- I paid 12 bucks for that hat.
- Coming back to work?

548
00:25:53,432 --> 00:25:56,163
It's a farewell appearance.
I'm going into business for myself.

549
00:25:56,368 --> 00:25:59,269
- What doing?
- I'm getting married tomorrow.

550
00:25:59,471 --> 00:26:02,099
Again? Are we invited to the wedding?

551
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:05,038
I might use you for a bridesmaid, Roy.

552
00:26:05,243 --> 00:26:08,041
- How are you, Murphy?
- What are you getting married for?

553
00:26:08,247 --> 00:26:10,339
- None of your business.
- Ain't fooling us, are you?

554
00:26:10,549 --> 00:26:12,882
Fooling? Look what I've got in here.

555
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:15,519
Three tickets to Albany
on the 6:00 train tonight.

556
00:26:15,721 --> 00:26:16,721
Three?

557
00:26:16,923 --> 00:26:20,825
For me and my beau and,
hats off boys, his sweet darling ma.

558
00:26:21,027 --> 00:26:22,926
- That's nice.
- What kind of marriage is that?

559
00:26:23,128 --> 00:26:26,326
I'm settling down.
I'm through with the newspaper business.

560
00:26:26,531 --> 00:26:30,058
Can you picture Hildy singing
lullabies and hanging out didies?

561
00:26:30,269 --> 00:26:32,395
- Swapping lies over the back fence?
- Sour grapes.

562
00:26:32,605 --> 00:26:34,266
She'll get tired beating rugs.

563
00:26:34,473 --> 00:26:36,532
I'm not going to beat any rugs.

564
00:26:37,375 --> 00:26:40,072
That's 3rd and Jefferson.
Where the Central School is.

565
00:26:40,278 --> 00:26:42,179
- No school this time of day.
- What do you care for? You quit.

566
00:26:42,381 --> 00:26:43,677
You said you were through.

567
00:26:43,883 --> 00:26:47,215
I just thought it might be
a good fire, that's all.

568
00:26:47,420 --> 00:26:50,583
- What's that?
- Practicing for the Williams party.

569
00:26:50,789 --> 00:26:52,916
- You'll miss a nice hanging.
- Not interested.

570
00:26:53,125 --> 00:26:55,116
Tell them to pipe down.

571
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:03,992
Keep quiet down there! How do you
expect us to get any work done?

572
00:27:04,202 --> 00:27:06,193
Shut up!

573
00:27:06,806 --> 00:27:09,069
Very little respect
for the press around here.

574
00:27:09,976 --> 00:27:11,307
Say, did anybody phone me?

575
00:27:11,510 --> 00:27:12,535
Not that I know of.

576
00:27:12,744 --> 00:27:15,179
Say, Hildy, does Walter know
you're getting married?

577
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:17,315
- Just had lunch with him.
- Does he know you're quitting?

578
00:27:17,517 --> 00:27:20,384
- I told him. Any more questions?
- Shall I deal you in?

579
00:27:20,586 --> 00:27:23,384
I haven't got time.
I have to do a yarn on Williams.

580
00:27:23,588 --> 00:27:25,557
Did he know what he was doing
when he fired that gun?

581
00:27:25,758 --> 00:27:29,285
If you ask us, no. If you ask the
state alienist, the answer is yes.

582
00:27:29,494 --> 00:27:31,258
- Who is he? What's he do?
- He was a bookkeeper.

583
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:33,454
He starts at $20 a week.
After 14 years...

584
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:36,191
...he works himself up to $17.50.
- Got more gum?

585
00:27:36,402 --> 00:27:39,633
McClosky Company goes out of business.
Williams loses his job.

586
00:27:39,838 --> 00:27:40,999
Can't get another.

587
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,840
I'm in.

588
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:46,871
So he hangs around the park listening
to soapbox spellbinders...

589
00:27:47,078 --> 00:27:48,979
...making speeches,
and begins believing them.

590
00:27:49,182 --> 00:27:50,342
And makes some of his own.

591
00:27:50,549 --> 00:27:52,211
- Up a dime.
- I'm in.

592
00:27:54,319 --> 00:27:57,016
- Anything else, Doc?
- No, that'll be all, Mr. Burns.

593
00:27:57,222 --> 00:27:58,416
Everything okay?

594
00:27:58,624 --> 00:28:00,114
Nothing to worry about.

595
00:28:00,326 --> 00:28:01,554
Good, good.

596
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:02,818
How are you doing, Bruce?

597
00:28:03,028 --> 00:28:04,496
Just one more thing.

598
00:28:04,696 --> 00:28:08,097
- Good day, Mr. Burns. Mr. Baldwin.
- Goodbye, Doc. Thanks very much.

599
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,394
Who's the beneficiary?

600
00:28:10,603 --> 00:28:13,595
- Excuse me?
- That is, in case of your death.

601
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:16,798
- Who do we pay the money to?
- Why, Hildy, of course.

602
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:20,035
I don't know. That would make me
feel pretty funny.

603
00:28:20,246 --> 00:28:23,510
Now, why shouldn't I make
Hildy my whatever-it-was?

604
00:28:23,715 --> 00:28:25,444
I feel I should take care of her.

605
00:28:25,651 --> 00:28:28,142
But you will take care of her, Bruce.

606
00:28:28,354 --> 00:28:31,186
Say, if that doctor is right,
I'm good for a long time yet.

607
00:28:31,390 --> 00:28:34,586
Look, Bruce, this is
a debt of honor with me.

608
00:28:34,794 --> 00:28:37,354
I was a bad husband to Hildy.

609
00:28:37,563 --> 00:28:39,462
She could have claimed
a lot of alimony.

610
00:28:39,664 --> 00:28:40,961
But she wouldn't take any.

611
00:28:41,166 --> 00:28:43,226
She had it coming to her,
but she was too independent.

612
00:28:43,435 --> 00:28:46,461
- I'm independent too, you know.
- I know you are.

613
00:28:46,672 --> 00:28:48,902
But look, you just figure it this way.

614
00:28:49,107 --> 00:28:52,805
I'm good for, we'll say
at least 25 years yet.

615
00:28:53,011 --> 00:28:56,948
By then, you'll have made enough so
that money won't mean anything to you.

616
00:28:57,148 --> 00:28:59,013
But suppose you haven't made good.

617
00:28:59,218 --> 00:29:02,016
What about Hildy's old age?
Think of Hildy.

618
00:29:02,755 --> 00:29:04,221
I can see her now.

619
00:29:04,423 --> 00:29:07,688
White-haired, lavender and old lace.

620
00:29:07,894 --> 00:29:10,419
- Can't you see her, Bruce?
- Yes, yes, I can.

621
00:29:10,630 --> 00:29:12,790
She's old, isn't she?

622
00:29:13,633 --> 00:29:17,693
Don't you think that Hildy's entitled
to spend her remaining years...

623
00:29:17,903 --> 00:29:21,101
...without worries of money?
Of course you do, Bruce.

624
00:29:21,307 --> 00:29:23,069
Of course, if you put it that way.

625
00:29:23,843 --> 00:29:26,835
And remember, I love her too.

626
00:29:27,613 --> 00:29:30,104
Yes, I'm beginning to realize that.

627
00:29:30,316 --> 00:29:32,250
And the beauty of it is...

628
00:29:32,451 --> 00:29:35,578
...she'll never have to know
until I've passed on.

629
00:29:35,788 --> 00:29:38,779
Maybe she'll think kindly of me...

630
00:29:39,125 --> 00:29:40,922
...after I'm gone.

631
00:29:52,203 --> 00:29:54,569
You make me feel like a heel,
coming between you.

632
00:29:54,773 --> 00:29:57,402
No, no, Bruce.
You didn't come between us.

633
00:29:57,609 --> 00:30:00,238
It was all over for her before you came
on the scene. For me...

634
00:30:01,913 --> 00:30:03,403
...it'll never be. What do you want?

635
00:30:03,615 --> 00:30:05,981
Can I see you a minute, please?

636
00:30:07,219 --> 00:30:08,742
Excuse me, Bruce.

637
00:30:10,155 --> 00:30:11,555
Did you get it, you get it?

638
00:30:11,757 --> 00:30:13,087
Where is it? Come on.

639
00:30:13,291 --> 00:30:16,954
- Certified?
- Sure. But Walter, that's for $2,500.

640
00:30:19,265 --> 00:30:20,993
Here we are certified
and everything.

641
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,134
Certified.

642
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:28,499
I'm afraid Hildy'll feel ashamed
to think she hasn't trusted you.

643
00:30:28,708 --> 00:30:29,799
But she'll know some day.

644
00:30:30,009 --> 00:30:33,604
You promised to phone her
as soon as you got the check.

645
00:30:33,813 --> 00:30:35,302
Oh, yes, yes, of course.

646
00:30:35,513 --> 00:30:38,607
Get me Hildy Johnson, press room,
criminal courts building.

647
00:30:38,817 --> 00:30:41,945
Sit down, Bruce.
The operator will get her for you.

648
00:30:43,288 --> 00:30:45,051
Excuse me, will you?

649
00:30:46,459 --> 00:30:48,153
Yes, I'll wait, thank you.

650
00:30:50,663 --> 00:30:53,188
Start hollering. Hildegarde.

651
00:30:53,398 --> 00:30:54,923
Thank you.

652
00:30:55,134 --> 00:30:56,657
Hildy Johnson speaking.

653
00:31:00,071 --> 00:31:01,868
Take it easy, will you?

654
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:06,201
Did you get the check?
Is it certified?

655
00:31:06,412 --> 00:31:09,381
Certified and everything.
I have it right in my pocket.

656
00:31:09,949 --> 00:31:11,540
In your pocket. That's fine.

657
00:31:11,750 --> 00:31:14,151
Wait. Maybe it isn't so fine.
Where are you?

658
00:31:14,386 --> 00:31:15,479
Mr. Burns' office.

659
00:31:15,688 --> 00:31:16,814
Is he there?

660
00:31:17,522 --> 00:31:21,653
Look, Bruce. I don't want you to
carry that check in your pocket.

661
00:31:21,861 --> 00:31:23,226
Well, because...

662
00:31:23,429 --> 00:31:25,521
Yes, yes, I know all that.
But...

663
00:31:27,199 --> 00:31:29,064
There's an old
newspaper superstition...

664
00:31:29,268 --> 00:31:32,327
...that the first big check you get,
you put in the lining of your hat.

665
00:31:33,204 --> 00:31:36,002
In your hat. It brings good luck.

666
00:31:36,208 --> 00:31:38,142
I've been a reporter for 20 years.
I never heard that.

667
00:31:38,344 --> 00:31:41,744
Neither did I. I know it
sounds silly, dear, but do it for me.

668
00:31:41,947 --> 00:31:43,174
Yes, yes, right now.

669
00:31:43,382 --> 00:31:45,474
All right. Just a minute.

670
00:31:54,692 --> 00:31:56,023
There, I've done it.

671
00:31:56,228 --> 00:31:57,626
Anything else?

672
00:31:58,396 --> 00:31:59,796
Oh, yes.

673
00:31:59,999 --> 00:32:01,057
All right.

674
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:05,760
Yes, I'll tell him. Goodbye.

675
00:32:06,404 --> 00:32:07,429
Everything all right?

676
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,505
Hildy said she'll get right to work.

677
00:32:09,708 --> 00:32:11,231
- Fine.
- I must be going now.

678
00:32:11,443 --> 00:32:14,277
You don't want to forget this.
It might rain, you know.

679
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:15,480
Thanks.

680
00:32:15,513 --> 00:32:18,607
You mind if I don't show you out?
I'm so busy in here.

681
00:32:18,817 --> 00:32:19,910
Thanks for everything.

682
00:32:20,118 --> 00:32:22,144
- What did you say?
- Thanks for everything.

683
00:32:22,354 --> 00:32:25,221
Nonsense. Don't thank me.
I should thank you.

684
00:32:25,423 --> 00:32:26,913
- So long.
- So long.

685
00:32:40,338 --> 00:32:41,532
Hello, Cooley.

686
00:32:42,273 --> 00:32:43,763
What are you doing here?

687
00:32:43,976 --> 00:32:45,840
I want an interview with Earl Williams.

688
00:32:46,045 --> 00:32:47,171
- No more interviews.
- Why not?

689
00:32:47,378 --> 00:32:50,871
Sheriff's orders. Besides, a doctor's
coming over. Can't do it.

690
00:32:51,083 --> 00:32:52,481
Say, is this your money?

691
00:32:52,684 --> 00:32:54,049
- I don't think it is.
- Twenty bucks?

692
00:32:54,252 --> 00:32:55,810
- I guess it is.
- That's what I thought.

693
00:32:56,020 --> 00:32:57,352
Come on, I'm in a hurry.

694
00:32:57,556 --> 00:32:58,886
Open up here.

695
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,251
- Now, Hildy, don't be...
- I won't be long.

696
00:33:06,432 --> 00:33:08,262
- Hello, Earl.
- Hello.

697
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:11,095
My name's Johnson. Mind if I talk to
you for a few minutes?

698
00:33:11,303 --> 00:33:13,532
No, I haven't anything else to do.

699
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:15,365
I guess that's right.

700
00:33:19,178 --> 00:33:22,739
So I couldn't plead insanity.
I'm just as sane as anybody else.

701
00:33:22,948 --> 00:33:24,346
You didn't mean to kill that policeman?

702
00:33:24,549 --> 00:33:27,451
Of course not. It's against
everything I stand for.

703
00:33:27,653 --> 00:33:30,416
They know it was an accident.
I'm not guilty.

704
00:33:30,623 --> 00:33:32,488
It's just the world.

705
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:35,555
I see what you mean.

706
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,491
Sorry about the lipstick, Earl.
Now, look, after you lost your job...

707
00:33:39,698 --> 00:33:42,460
- ...what did you do?
- I tried to find another job.

708
00:33:42,667 --> 00:33:44,396
I mean, how did you spend your time?

709
00:33:44,603 --> 00:33:48,505
I used to sit around in the park,
anyplace. I don't smoke.

710
00:33:48,707 --> 00:33:51,642
When you were in the park,
did you hear any speeches?

711
00:33:51,844 --> 00:33:54,311
You mean those fellows
that talk too much?

712
00:33:55,146 --> 00:33:56,579
I didn't pay any attention...

713
00:33:56,781 --> 00:33:58,772
Did you hear anything they said?

714
00:33:58,983 --> 00:33:59,983
Yes.

715
00:34:00,251 --> 00:34:02,685
Is there anything in particular
you remember?

716
00:34:02,887 --> 00:34:05,015
- There was one fellow.
- What did he talk about?

717
00:34:05,223 --> 00:34:07,419
He talked about production for use.

718
00:34:07,625 --> 00:34:08,751
Production for use?

719
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:12,021
Yes, he said everything
should be made use of.

720
00:34:12,231 --> 00:34:13,527
Makes sense, doesn't it?

721
00:34:13,731 --> 00:34:16,393
Yes, I liked him.
He was a good speaker.

722
00:34:17,001 --> 00:34:19,027
When you found yourself
with that gun in your hand...

723
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:22,297
...and that policeman coming at you,
what did you think about?

724
00:34:22,507 --> 00:34:24,099
I don't know exactly.

725
00:34:24,309 --> 00:34:26,800
Could it have been
"production for use"?

726
00:34:27,012 --> 00:34:30,539
- I don't know. L...
- What's a gun for, Earl?

727
00:34:30,748 --> 00:34:31,875
A gun?

728
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:33,914
Why, to shoot, of course.

729
00:34:34,954 --> 00:34:36,818
And maybe that's why you used it.

730
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:38,545
- Maybe.
- It seems reasonable.

731
00:34:38,757 --> 00:34:40,748
Yes, yes, it is.

732
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:43,360
I've never had a gun in my hand before.

733
00:34:43,561 --> 00:34:45,586
And that's what a gun's for, isn't it?

734
00:34:45,797 --> 00:34:47,458
- Maybe that's why...
- Sure, it is.

735
00:34:47,666 --> 00:34:52,193
That's what I thought of. "Production
for use". It's simple, isn't it?

736
00:34:52,403 --> 00:34:54,894
- Very simple.
- There's nothing crazy about that.

737
00:34:55,106 --> 00:34:57,733
- Nothing at all.
- Write about that in your paper.

738
00:34:57,943 --> 00:35:00,309
You bet I will.
Who sent you the roses?

739
00:35:00,512 --> 00:35:02,206
Miss Mollie Malloy.
She's wonderful...

740
00:35:02,414 --> 00:35:03,505
Is that her picture?

741
00:35:03,715 --> 00:35:06,650
- Yes. She's beautiful, isn't she?
- Time's up, Hildy.

742
00:35:06,851 --> 00:35:07,909
All right.

743
00:35:09,454 --> 00:35:10,454
Guess that's all.

744
00:35:10,489 --> 00:35:13,856
I liked talking to you.
Goodbye, Miss Johnson.

745
00:35:15,260 --> 00:35:16,523
Goodbye, Earl.

746
00:35:17,295 --> 00:35:18,523
Good luck.

747
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,960
- Three landladies, boys.
- Got well, didn't you?

748
00:35:24,168 --> 00:35:25,965
<i>I wonder what the Post
will do without Hildy?</i>

749
00:35:26,170 --> 00:35:28,434
You suppose Walter Burns
will ever let her go?

750
00:35:28,641 --> 00:35:30,938
Remember when Fenton
wanted to go to Hollywood?

751
00:35:31,143 --> 00:35:33,235
- Had him thrown in jail for arson.
- Forgery.

752
00:35:33,445 --> 00:35:35,777
- Was that it?
- Yeah, give me some change.

753
00:35:35,981 --> 00:35:36,981
Hey, Mac.

754
00:35:37,416 --> 00:35:38,815
Hey, Stairway Sam.

755
00:35:39,617 --> 00:35:41,552
Would you mind turning on some lights?

756
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:43,550
It's so dark, you can't see anything.

757
00:35:43,755 --> 00:35:45,280
Who's this guy Hildy's marrying?

758
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,981
I don't know. Bruce something.

759
00:35:47,192 --> 00:35:49,456
- I give the marriage six months.
- Why?

760
00:35:49,661 --> 00:35:51,856
She won't be able to be away
from the paper any longer.

761
00:35:52,063 --> 00:35:54,123
Did you see her
when that bell went off?

762
00:35:54,333 --> 00:35:58,201
It must be pretty nice to be able
to walk out of a place and quit.

763
00:35:58,403 --> 00:36:01,771
I had a publicity job offered to
me last year. I should have taken it.

764
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:03,907
That's what I'd like,
a job on the side.

765
00:36:04,108 --> 00:36:07,875
A desk and a stenographer.
I wouldn't mind a nice, big blonde.

766
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,172
With big brown eyes.

767
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:12,248
I'll bet you ten to one it don't last
six months.

768
00:36:12,451 --> 00:36:15,853
She's just like us, or we wouldn't be
waiting for that guy to dance.

769
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:19,320
- Miss Mollie Malloy.
- Hello, Mollie. How's tricks?

770
00:36:19,525 --> 00:36:23,757
- I've been looking for you tramps.
- Come to pay a call on Williams?

771
00:36:23,963 --> 00:36:27,626
Nice roses you sent Earl. What do you
want done with them tomorrow?

772
00:36:27,833 --> 00:36:29,233
A lot of wise guys, ain't you?

773
00:36:29,436 --> 00:36:31,427
You're breaking up the game.
What do you want?

774
00:36:31,637 --> 00:36:32,900
I came to...

775
00:36:34,340 --> 00:36:36,309
I came to tell you what I
think of you. All of you.

776
00:36:36,509 --> 00:36:37,907
Keep your shirt on.

777
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,875
If you was worth breaking my nails on,
I'd tear your face open.

778
00:36:41,081 --> 00:36:44,346
What are you sore about?
Wasn't that a swell story we gave you?

779
00:36:45,652 --> 00:36:48,382
You crumbs have been making
a fool out of me long enough.

780
00:36:48,588 --> 00:36:52,023
I never said I loved Earl, and was
willing to marry him on the gallows.

781
00:36:52,224 --> 00:36:53,224
You made that up.

782
00:36:53,326 --> 00:36:56,489
And about my being his soul mate and
having a love nest with him.

783
00:36:56,695 --> 00:36:59,597
You've been around that cuckoo
since they threw him in the death house.

784
00:36:59,798 --> 00:37:02,699
- That's a lie.
- Everybody knows you're his girlfriend.

785
00:37:02,902 --> 00:37:05,699
I met Mr. Williams
just once in my life.

786
00:37:05,905 --> 00:37:08,429
When he was wandering in the
rain without his hat and coat on...

787
00:37:08,641 --> 00:37:10,733
...like a sick dog,
the day before the shooting.

788
00:37:10,943 --> 00:37:11,943
Give me one.

789
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:14,103
I went up to him like any
human being would...

790
00:37:14,313 --> 00:37:16,179
...and asked him what was the matter.

791
00:37:16,382 --> 00:37:19,875
He told me about being fired after
being on the job for 14 years.

792
00:37:20,085 --> 00:37:21,746
- Who bets?
- Bet 20 cents.

793
00:37:21,954 --> 00:37:24,286
I brought him up to my room
because it was warm.

794
00:37:24,490 --> 00:37:26,219
Put it on a phonograph.

795
00:37:26,425 --> 00:37:28,326
Listen to me, please.

796
00:37:29,161 --> 00:37:32,757
I tell you he just sat there
talking to me all night.

797
00:37:32,965 --> 00:37:35,195
He never once laid a hand on me.

798
00:37:35,402 --> 00:37:37,460
And in the morning he went away...

799
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:40,264
...and I never saw him again
till that day of the trial.

800
00:37:40,974 --> 00:37:43,237
- Sure, I was his witness.
- And what a witness.

801
00:37:43,443 --> 00:37:45,103
That's why you're persecuting me.

802
00:37:45,311 --> 00:37:48,405
Because Earl treated me decent,
and not like an animal.

803
00:37:48,614 --> 00:37:51,106
- We're busy.
- Go see your boyfriend.

804
00:37:51,317 --> 00:37:53,012
- He's got a nice room.
- Not for long.

805
00:37:53,219 --> 00:37:55,210
He left a call for 7 a.m.

806
00:37:55,487 --> 00:37:59,822
It's a wonder lightning don't
come down and strike you all dead.

807
00:38:10,335 --> 00:38:11,461
What's that?

808
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:14,902
They're fixing up a pain in the neck
for your boyfriend.

809
00:38:15,375 --> 00:38:16,637
Shame on you.

810
00:38:16,842 --> 00:38:18,275
Shame on you!

811
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:22,547
A poor little fellow that never
meant nobody no harm.

812
00:38:22,748 --> 00:38:25,740
Sitting with the angel of death,
and you cracking jokes.

813
00:38:25,952 --> 00:38:27,646
You're going to get out of here.

814
00:38:27,853 --> 00:38:30,210
- Take your hands off me!
- Let's get out of here.

815
00:38:30,422 --> 00:38:31,548
They ain't human.

816
00:38:31,757 --> 00:38:34,385
- I know. They're newspapermen.
- All they've been doing is lying.

817
00:38:34,594 --> 00:38:36,585
All they're doing is writing lies.

818
00:38:36,795 --> 00:38:38,559
Why won't they listen to me?

819
00:38:39,398 --> 00:38:41,230
Why won't they listen to me?

820
00:38:59,952 --> 00:39:00,976
Who?

821
00:39:01,186 --> 00:39:02,186
Hildy Johnson?

822
00:39:02,856 --> 00:39:04,914
Hang on. She'll be back in a minute.

823
00:39:08,862 --> 00:39:10,989
You guys want to play any more cards?

824
00:39:11,197 --> 00:39:13,927
What's the use? I can't win anyway.

825
00:39:30,717 --> 00:39:32,378
Gentlemen of the press.

826
00:39:34,887 --> 00:39:35,980
Hildy.

827
00:39:36,322 --> 00:39:37,619
Phone for you.

828
00:39:43,829 --> 00:39:44,829
What?

829
00:39:45,331 --> 00:39:46,490
Where are you?

830
00:39:46,965 --> 00:39:48,297
You're where?

831
00:39:48,867 --> 00:39:50,597
Well, how did that happen?

832
00:39:50,969 --> 00:39:53,130
Never mind, never mind.
I'll be right down.

833
00:39:55,541 --> 00:39:57,168
I'm sorry, Pete. Sorry.

834
00:39:58,443 --> 00:39:59,876
Hi, Sheriff. How you doing?

835
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:03,809
My shin and my back.
What's going on around here?

836
00:40:04,016 --> 00:40:06,746
- Bruce was in trouble.
- Lioness rushes to defend cub.

837
00:40:06,952 --> 00:40:09,182
Man forgets hankie.
Mama goes to wipe nose.

838
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:11,414
I still give that marriage
six months.

839
00:40:11,623 --> 00:40:13,682
I don't know what you fellows
are talking about.

840
00:40:13,893 --> 00:40:15,519
What do you want, Pete?

841
00:40:15,728 --> 00:40:18,822
Oh, I got the tickets for
the hanging here, boys.

842
00:40:19,032 --> 00:40:20,260
- Pete?
- What?

843
00:40:20,465 --> 00:40:24,197
Why can't you hang this guy at
five o'clock instead of seven?

844
00:40:24,403 --> 00:40:27,271
It won't hurt you, and
we can make the city edition.

845
00:40:27,472 --> 00:40:28,769
That's kind of raw, Roy...

846
00:40:28,974 --> 00:40:31,500
...hanging a man in his sleep
to please a newspaper.

847
00:40:31,710 --> 00:40:35,112
But you can reprieve him twice
so he hangs three days before election.

848
00:40:35,315 --> 00:40:37,442
And you can run on a
law-and-order ticket.

849
00:40:37,650 --> 00:40:40,414
I had absolutely nothing
to do with those reprieves.

850
00:40:40,619 --> 00:40:42,644
How do we know there won't
be another tonight?

851
00:40:42,855 --> 00:40:44,880
What if Egelhoffer
finds Williams insane?

852
00:40:45,090 --> 00:40:48,686
He won't find him insane, because
he isn't. He's just as sane as I am.

853
00:40:48,894 --> 00:40:50,293
Saner!

854
00:40:50,496 --> 00:40:53,090
Be serious, boys.
After all, this is a hanging.

855
00:40:53,298 --> 00:40:55,199
And it's going to go
according to schedule.

856
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:57,835
Seven o'clock in the morning
and not a minute earlier.

857
00:40:58,036 --> 00:41:00,335
There's such a thing as
being humane, you know.

858
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:02,474
All right, Pinky.
Wait until you want a favor.

859
00:41:02,675 --> 00:41:04,802
- And please don't call me Pinky.
- Why not?

860
00:41:05,010 --> 00:41:07,911
Because I got a name, see,
and it's Peter B. Hartwell.

861
00:41:08,114 --> 00:41:09,581
- What's the "B" for?
- Bull.

862
00:41:10,449 --> 00:41:13,817
But I'm innocent. I didn't do it.
I never stole a watch in my life!

863
00:41:14,019 --> 00:41:16,351
I know you didn't, Bruce.
Mike, let him out.

864
00:41:16,556 --> 00:41:19,650
I can't. He's accused of stealing
a watch they found on him.

865
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:21,621
- But I never stole...
- Please, Bruce.

866
00:41:21,827 --> 00:41:23,590
Who accused him?
Diamond Louie, a crook.

867
00:41:23,795 --> 00:41:26,663
- I know. It's no good.
- You going to let him out or not?

868
00:41:26,865 --> 00:41:28,231
- I never stole...
- Please.

869
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:31,061
<i>All right, you're not.
Read the Post in the morning.</i>

870
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:33,737
I can't imagine who'd do a thing
like that to me.

871
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:36,875
- I can't think of any enemies.
- I'm sure you haven't any...

872
00:41:37,076 --> 00:41:40,045
- Have you got the check?
- Oh, yes, I have it right here.

873
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,246
That's a funny superstition
you newspaper people have.

874
00:41:43,449 --> 00:41:45,110
Yes, isn't it?

875
00:41:45,318 --> 00:41:46,909
About being arrested, I thought...

876
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:50,146
...maybe Walter Burns might have
something to do with it.

877
00:41:50,356 --> 00:41:52,550
But then, of course,
I realized he couldn't have.

878
00:41:52,759 --> 00:41:55,090
- Why?
- He's a very nice fellow.

879
00:41:55,293 --> 00:41:57,193
Oh, yes, I found that out.

880
00:41:57,396 --> 00:42:00,126
- What's the matter?
- I've lost my wallet.

881
00:42:00,333 --> 00:42:03,028
Yes? Well, Bruce, never mind.
I have the money.

882
00:42:03,235 --> 00:42:04,760
Better give me the check too.

883
00:42:04,971 --> 00:42:06,666
And that picture of us in Bermuda.

884
00:42:06,873 --> 00:42:10,036
Don't bother, Bruce.
You'll find lots of things missing.

885
00:42:12,679 --> 00:42:15,306
Wait here.
I'm not taking any more chances.

886
00:42:15,514 --> 00:42:17,914
I'll be down in three minutes.
We'll take the next train.

887
00:42:18,117 --> 00:42:19,117
Sorry.

888
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:22,650
"And so into this
little tortured mind...

889
00:42:22,855 --> 00:42:25,949
...came the idea that that gun
had been produced for use.

890
00:42:26,159 --> 00:42:27,648
And use it he did.

891
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:32,193
But the state has a production
for use plan too. It has a gallows.

892
00:42:32,398 --> 00:42:35,594
And at 7 a.m., unless a miracle occurs,
that gallows will be used...

893
00:42:35,802 --> 00:42:38,737
...to separate the soul
of Earl Williams from his body.

894
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:40,666
And out of Mollie Malloy's life...

895
00:42:40,873 --> 00:42:43,898
...will go the one kindly
soul she ever knew".

896
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:46,974
That's as far as she got.

897
00:42:47,179 --> 00:42:49,010
But can that girl write an interview?

898
00:42:49,215 --> 00:42:50,739
She'll do till somebody
else comes along.

899
00:42:50,949 --> 00:42:53,315
It's not ethical,
reading other people's stuff.

900
00:42:53,518 --> 00:42:55,009
Where you get that ethics stuff?

901
00:42:55,221 --> 00:42:57,155
You're the only one
who'll swipe any of it.

902
00:42:57,356 --> 00:43:01,190
I say anybody that can write like that
won't give it up to sew socks...

903
00:43:01,393 --> 00:43:03,362
...for a guy in the
insurance business.

904
00:43:03,563 --> 00:43:05,963
Now I give that marriage 3 months
and I'm laying 3-1.

905
00:43:06,164 --> 00:43:08,132
- Any takers?
- I'll take that bet.

906
00:43:08,333 --> 00:43:11,769
A girl can't leave the room without
being discussed by old ladies.

907
00:43:11,971 --> 00:43:14,735
<i>Hello, Post? Get me Walter Burns,
will you, please?</i>

908
00:43:15,041 --> 00:43:16,769
Don't get sore.
We were only saying...

909
00:43:16,976 --> 00:43:19,206
...a reporter like you
wouldn't quit so easy.

910
00:43:19,411 --> 00:43:23,143
This is Hildy Johnson. I can quit
all right, without a single quiver.

911
00:43:23,349 --> 00:43:25,943
I'll live like a human being,
not like you chumps.

912
00:43:26,152 --> 00:43:28,552
Is that you?
I've got some news for you.

913
00:43:28,755 --> 00:43:31,882
I got the interview, but I've got
some more important news.

914
00:43:32,090 --> 00:43:34,150
Better get a pencil
and take it down.

915
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:35,793
All ready?

916
00:43:35,994 --> 00:43:38,463
Now, get this,
you double-crossing chimpanzee.

917
00:43:38,664 --> 00:43:40,893
There won't be an interview
or a story.

918
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:43,034
Your check leaves with me
in 20 minutes.

919
00:43:43,235 --> 00:43:45,704
I wouldn't cover
the burning of Rome for you.

920
00:43:45,905 --> 00:43:47,929
And if I ever lay my eyes
on you again...

921
00:43:48,141 --> 00:43:51,440
...I'll hammer on your monkey skull
so it rings like a Chinese gong!

922
00:43:51,643 --> 00:43:55,170
You don't know why I'm angry?
Get Louie to tell you about his watch.

923
00:43:55,380 --> 00:43:57,576
And there's just one other
little thing.

924
00:44:00,987 --> 00:44:03,512
Hear that?
That's the story I just wrote.

925
00:44:03,722 --> 00:44:06,123
I know we had a bargain.
I said I'd write it.

926
00:44:06,324 --> 00:44:09,556
I didn't say I wouldn't tear it up.
It's all in little pieces now.

927
00:44:09,762 --> 00:44:11,889
And I hope to do the same
for you someday.

928
00:44:12,097 --> 00:44:14,259
That's my farewell
to the newspaper game.

929
00:44:14,467 --> 00:44:16,297
I'll be a woman.
Not a news machine.

930
00:44:16,501 --> 00:44:20,302
I'll have babies, give them cod-liver
oil and watch their teeth grow.

931
00:44:20,505 --> 00:44:23,498
And if I ever see one of them
look at a paper, I'll brain him.

932
00:44:23,708 --> 00:44:24,902
Where's my hat?

933
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:29,447
- Mr. Burns? Yes, she's still here.
- Give me that.

934
00:44:31,550 --> 00:44:32,847
And another thing I want...

935
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:37,019
Where is my...
There it is.

936
00:44:37,356 --> 00:44:39,916
- Hello, Doctor. Sorry to be late.
- Quite all right.

937
00:44:40,126 --> 00:44:42,389
These boys from the newspapers
take up my time.

938
00:44:42,594 --> 00:44:44,755
They wanted me to hang Williams
at their convenience.

939
00:44:44,963 --> 00:44:47,063
- Oh, hello, Earl.
- These newspapers.

940
00:44:47,266 --> 00:44:49,233
- What they did to me in Chicago!
- I believe it.

941
00:44:49,434 --> 00:44:51,130
- Always after me for interviews.
- Me too.

942
00:44:51,336 --> 00:44:53,567
I did promise to make
some sort of statement...

943
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:55,672
...when I finished here.
You don't mind, do you?

944
00:44:55,875 --> 00:44:58,742
It is hardly ethical. All statements
are supposed to come from me.

945
00:44:58,945 --> 00:45:02,641
I see. What do you say to giving
them some sort of joint interview?

946
00:45:02,849 --> 00:45:05,715
I can discuss some of the psychological
aspects of the case and you...

947
00:45:05,918 --> 00:45:07,612
We'd have our pictures
taken together?

948
00:45:07,820 --> 00:45:09,411
- Shaking hands.
- Splendid idea!

949
00:45:09,621 --> 00:45:10,782
I don't take a good picture.

950
00:45:10,989 --> 00:45:13,322
That doesn't matter.
Publicity's the thing.

951
00:45:13,525 --> 00:45:16,016
Doctor, I'm getting awful tired.

952
00:45:16,228 --> 00:45:18,094
Can't I go back to jail again?

953
00:45:18,297 --> 00:45:19,923
I'm sorry.
I forgot you were there.

954
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:21,860
No, we've further questions for you.

955
00:45:22,068 --> 00:45:24,092
Sheriff, would you extinguish
the lights?

956
00:45:24,302 --> 00:45:28,432
That will help with what we're
doing here. Now, let me see.

957
00:45:30,009 --> 00:45:33,467
Mr. Williams, you know, of course,
that you are going to be executed.

958
00:45:33,679 --> 00:45:36,340
Who do you feel
is responsible for that?

959
00:45:36,548 --> 00:45:39,278
I am innocent. It wasn't my fault.

960
00:45:39,485 --> 00:45:41,179
- Well, Murph.
- Send a post card, kid.

961
00:45:41,387 --> 00:45:42,978
- Goodbye.
- Au revoir, Hildegarde.

962
00:45:43,188 --> 00:45:44,246
When will we see you again?

963
00:45:44,456 --> 00:45:46,583
Next time you see me,
I'll be in a Rolls Royce...

964
00:45:46,791 --> 00:45:48,588
...giving interviews on success.

965
00:45:48,793 --> 00:45:50,226
So long, you wage slaves.

966
00:45:50,963 --> 00:45:53,625
When you're climbing fire escapes,
getting kicked out front doors...

967
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,630
...and eating in one-armed joints...

968
00:45:55,835 --> 00:45:58,030
...don't forget your pal,
Hildy Johnson.

969
00:45:58,237 --> 00:46:01,501
And when the road beyond unfolds,
and the work...

970
00:46:08,313 --> 00:46:09,610
Look out! It's a jailbreak!

971
00:46:13,119 --> 00:46:15,552
What's the matter? What happened?

972
00:46:16,588 --> 00:46:18,556
Watch where you're aiming,
will you?

973
00:46:18,757 --> 00:46:20,487
Watch the gate! He'll try the gate!

974
00:46:20,693 --> 00:46:21,818
Who got away? Who was it?

975
00:46:22,027 --> 00:46:23,460
- Earl Williams!
- Who did he say?

976
00:46:23,663 --> 00:46:25,027
Earl Williams!

977
00:46:26,465 --> 00:46:28,695
Hello, hello! Hurry up,
this is important.

978
00:46:29,302 --> 00:46:31,293
- Flash! Earl Williams just escaped.
- Jailbreak!

979
00:46:31,836 --> 00:46:33,065
Williams went over the wall!

980
00:46:33,271 --> 00:46:34,568
I don't know anything yet.

981
00:46:40,646 --> 00:46:43,581
<i>Hello, Post? Give me Walter Burns,
quick. Hildy Johnson.</i>

982
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:46,248
Walter? Walter? Hildy.

983
00:46:46,452 --> 00:46:48,851
Earl Williams just escaped
from the county jail.

984
00:46:49,655 --> 00:46:51,554
Don't worry, I'm on the job.

985
00:47:06,438 --> 00:47:08,134
Hey, Cooley!

986
00:47:08,340 --> 00:47:09,340
Wait!

987
00:47:13,411 --> 00:47:15,141
Hey, wait a minute!

988
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,266
Cooley, I want to talk to you!

989
00:47:45,978 --> 00:47:47,842
This is Endicott. Give me rewrite.

990
00:47:48,748 --> 00:47:49,873
He ain't here.

991
00:47:50,081 --> 00:47:52,141
Hello, Gil?
Here's the situation now.

992
00:47:52,351 --> 00:47:54,784
Ready? Williams was taken to
the sheriff's...

993
00:47:54,987 --> 00:47:58,753
...to be examined by Egelhoffer.
In a few minutes, he shot his way out.

994
00:47:58,958 --> 00:48:02,951
Nobody knows where he got the gun.
He got out through the skylight.

995
00:48:03,161 --> 00:48:04,856
He must have slid down the rainpipe.

996
00:48:05,063 --> 00:48:07,293
Nobody knows where he got it.
Or they won't talk.

997
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:08,500
Give me the desk.

998
00:48:08,634 --> 00:48:11,068
The crime commission offers
a $10,000 reward.

999
00:48:11,269 --> 00:48:13,670
No clue yet as to
Williams' whereabouts.

1000
00:48:13,873 --> 00:48:16,432
Here's a little feature.
An accident about a tear bomb.

1001
00:48:16,641 --> 00:48:19,041
Yeah, tear bomb, tear bomb.
Criminals cry for it.

1002
00:48:19,244 --> 00:48:20,268
I don't know.

1003
00:48:20,478 --> 00:48:24,108
The tear bomb went off unexpectedly
in the hands of the bombing squad.

1004
00:48:24,315 --> 00:48:25,943
The following deputies
were rushed to the hospital.

1005
00:48:26,152 --> 00:48:28,143
- A fine friend you are.
- Their names are...

1006
00:48:28,353 --> 00:48:30,253
...Mervin D. Wilkerson,
the mayor's brother-in-law.

1007
00:48:30,456 --> 00:48:31,684
After all I've done for you.

1008
00:48:31,891 --> 00:48:34,155
Howard Schuster, the sheriff's uncle.

1009
00:48:34,360 --> 00:48:36,590
Highlights on Sheriff
Hartwell's manhunt.

1010
00:48:36,795 --> 00:48:39,458
William Mansfield, his landlord,
and Lester Winthrop...

1011
00:48:39,664 --> 00:48:40,927
...who married the sheriff's niece.

1012
00:48:41,132 --> 00:48:43,260
You remember, the very homely dame?
Call you back.

1013
00:48:43,469 --> 00:48:46,597
Mrs. William Rice, scrub lady,
while scrubbing the eigth floor...

1014
00:48:46,806 --> 00:48:48,773
...was shot by one of
the sheriff's deputies.

1015
00:48:48,974 --> 00:48:49,974
Look, I'm not...

1016
00:48:50,775 --> 00:48:52,242
There goes another scrub lady!

1017
00:48:52,445 --> 00:48:54,777
It was only a flesh wound.
They took her to the hospital.

1018
00:48:54,980 --> 00:48:57,949
- McCue speaking. Give me the desk.
- Any dope on how he escaped?

1019
00:48:58,150 --> 00:49:00,141
Maybe the sheriff let him out
so he could vote for him.

1020
00:49:00,351 --> 00:49:03,844
A man answering the description
of Earl Williams boarded a southbound...

1021
00:49:04,056 --> 00:49:05,682
Call you back.

1022
00:49:05,891 --> 00:49:08,552
- I thought you'd gone.
- I thought so too.

1023
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:10,728
Get me Walter Burns, quick!

1024
00:49:14,467 --> 00:49:15,525
Walter, listen.

1025
00:49:15,733 --> 00:49:19,170
I've got the story on how Williams
escaped, and I've got it exclusive.

1026
00:49:19,371 --> 00:49:21,702
That's right, and it's a pip.

1027
00:49:21,907 --> 00:49:24,398
It cost me $450
to tear it out of Cooley.

1028
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:25,838
What's the story?

1029
00:49:26,045 --> 00:49:29,172
I'll give it to you. But first I have
to tell you I gave him money.

1030
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:30,813
And it wasn't exactly mine.

1031
00:49:31,016 --> 00:49:32,949
It's Bruce's money
and I want it back.

1032
00:49:33,918 --> 00:49:35,215
Bruce's money?

1033
00:49:35,420 --> 00:49:37,855
Sure, you'll get it.
Now, what's the story?

1034
00:49:38,056 --> 00:49:40,923
I'll send the money.
I swear it on my mother's grave.

1035
00:49:41,126 --> 00:49:44,119
All right. Here's the...
Wait a minute, your mother's alive!

1036
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:46,820
My grandmother's grave.
What's the story?

1037
00:49:47,032 --> 00:49:48,896
You get that money down here.

1038
00:49:49,101 --> 00:49:52,400
All right, here's your story.
The jailbreak of your dreams.

1039
00:49:52,605 --> 00:49:55,369
This expert, Dr. Egelhoffer,
the thinker from New York...

1040
00:49:55,574 --> 00:49:58,168
...was giving Williams a sanity
test in the sheriff's office.

1041
00:49:58,376 --> 00:50:01,608
Sticking a lot of pins in him
so he could get his reflexes.

1042
00:50:01,813 --> 00:50:04,748
He decided to reenact the crime
as it had taken place...

1043
00:50:04,949 --> 00:50:07,543
...in order to study
Williams' coordination.

1044
00:50:07,753 --> 00:50:11,052
I'm coming to it. He had to have a gun
to reenact the crime with.

1045
00:50:11,257 --> 00:50:15,353
Who do you suppose supplied it?
Peter B. Hartwell. "B" for brains.

1046
00:50:17,329 --> 00:50:19,126
No kidding!

1047
00:50:19,764 --> 00:50:22,289
I'm not kidding. I'm not
good enough to make this up.

1048
00:50:22,501 --> 00:50:24,059
The sheriff gave his gun
to the professor...

1049
00:50:24,269 --> 00:50:27,262
...who gave it to Earl, who shot
the professor in the classified ads.

1050
00:50:27,472 --> 00:50:28,996
No, ads.

1051
00:50:29,208 --> 00:50:30,869
Ain't it perfect?

1052
00:50:31,076 --> 00:50:33,601
If he'd unrolled a red carpet
and loaned Williams an umbrella...

1053
00:50:33,811 --> 00:50:35,108
...it couldn't have been more ideal.

1054
00:50:35,313 --> 00:50:37,782
Who? Oh, no.
Egelhoffer wasn't badly hurt.

1055
00:50:37,983 --> 00:50:40,679
They took him to the hospital,
where they're afraid he'll recover.

1056
00:50:40,885 --> 00:50:42,717
That's great work, Hildy.

1057
00:50:42,922 --> 00:50:45,652
Stop worrying about that money.
You'll get it in 15 minutes.

1058
00:50:45,858 --> 00:50:49,851
I had better. Bruce is waiting
in a taxi for me and we're in a hurry.

1059
00:50:50,061 --> 00:50:51,119
Hold on a minute.

1060
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:52,762
Vangie, come here.

1061
00:50:52,965 --> 00:50:55,297
There's a guy in a taxi
in front of criminal courts.

1062
00:50:55,501 --> 00:50:56,501
Name's Bruce Baldwin.

1063
00:50:56,668 --> 00:51:00,264
- What does he look like?
- He looks like Ralph Bellamy.

1064
00:51:00,472 --> 00:51:01,961
- Oh, him?
- Can you handle it?

1065
00:51:02,173 --> 00:51:04,108
I've never flopped
on you yet, have I?

1066
00:51:04,309 --> 00:51:07,210
Come on, get going. You only got
about two minutes. Hurry.

1067
00:51:07,413 --> 00:51:09,880
Sorry to keep you waiting.
How much was it again?

1068
00:51:10,081 --> 00:51:12,846
$450. Well, just a second.

1069
00:51:13,052 --> 00:51:16,510
Louie, come here. I need $450
worth of counterfeit money.

1070
00:51:16,722 --> 00:51:20,021
- Can't carry that much, boss.
- No, just the $450 counterfeit.

1071
00:51:20,226 --> 00:51:21,226
I got that on me.

1072
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:23,452
Quite a coincidence.
Take it over to Hildy.

1073
00:51:23,661 --> 00:51:25,630
It's coming.
I'm sending it with Louie.

1074
00:51:25,831 --> 00:51:28,425
Thanks for your story.
And good luck on your honeymoon.

1075
00:51:28,634 --> 00:51:31,967
No, no, never mind the thanks.
Just see that money gets here.

1076
00:51:34,940 --> 00:51:37,773
- Hildy, you still here?
- No, I'm in Niagara Falls.

1077
00:51:37,976 --> 00:51:39,239
McCue speaking.

1078
00:51:39,445 --> 00:51:41,811
Emil, I got a good feature
on the manhunt.

1079
00:51:42,014 --> 00:51:46,110
Ready? Mrs. Phoebe DeWolfe, colored,
gave birth to a pickaninny...

1080
00:51:46,318 --> 00:51:50,048
...in a patrol wagon with Hartwell's
rifle squad acting as nurses.

1081
00:51:50,255 --> 00:51:52,121
Phoebe was walking along
the street when...

1082
00:51:52,324 --> 00:51:53,757
That's right.

1083
00:51:53,958 --> 00:51:56,860
So they coaxed her
into the patrol wagon.

1084
00:51:57,061 --> 00:51:59,326
When the pickanninny was born,
they checked...

1085
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,625
...to see if it was Earl Williams.
They knew he was hiding somewhere.

1086
00:52:03,268 --> 00:52:06,704
Here's the payoff. They named the kid
Peter Hartwell DeWolfe.

1087
00:52:06,905 --> 00:52:08,769
Press room.

1088
00:52:08,974 --> 00:52:11,498
Bruce? I thought you were
downstairs in a...

1089
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:12,972
What?

1090
00:52:13,177 --> 00:52:15,407
Arrested again. What for this time?

1091
00:52:15,614 --> 00:52:19,880
Well, they called it "mashing".

1092
00:52:20,552 --> 00:52:22,884
No, I didn't, Hildy!

1093
00:52:23,355 --> 00:52:25,481
I was sitting in the taxi
where you left me...

1094
00:52:25,690 --> 00:52:30,492
...and the young lady seemed to have a
dizzy spell and I just...

1095
00:52:33,164 --> 00:52:35,224
She's kind of...

1096
00:52:37,902 --> 00:52:39,666
Yes, she's a blonde.

1097
00:52:39,871 --> 00:52:41,237
Yes, very blonde.

1098
00:52:41,440 --> 00:52:43,737
Never mind. I know how it happened.
Just a minute.

1099
00:52:44,443 --> 00:52:46,934
Get me Walter Burns. Hildy Johnson.

1100
00:52:47,378 --> 00:52:50,780
Bruce, where are you? Twenty-seventh
Precinct? Hold on a minute.

1101
00:52:50,983 --> 00:52:52,746
Walter, you...

1102
00:52:52,951 --> 00:52:54,612
He was there a minute ago.

1103
00:52:54,820 --> 00:52:56,150
But I want...

1104
00:52:56,355 --> 00:52:59,289
"I'm sorry, I can't locate him".
Why, that double-crossing...

1105
00:52:59,490 --> 00:53:02,858
Hello, not you.
Bruce, I can't get there right away.

1106
00:53:03,061 --> 00:53:04,255
How about 20 minutes?

1107
00:53:04,463 --> 00:53:06,293
I have to wait here for the...

1108
00:53:06,498 --> 00:53:08,260
I'll tell you when I see you.

1109
00:53:08,467 --> 00:53:10,230
If I ever get my hands
on Walter...

1110
00:53:10,436 --> 00:53:12,996
- Anything I can do to help?
- How much money you got?

1111
00:53:13,204 --> 00:53:14,536
- $1.80.
- 64 cents.

1112
00:53:14,739 --> 00:53:17,503
- Welcome to it.
- Thanks, you better buy an annuity.

1113
00:53:17,742 --> 00:53:21,143
What's that, Emil? No, I can't
give you an official statement.

1114
00:53:21,347 --> 00:53:24,612
No, wait a minute. Here's the mayor.
How about a statement, Mayor?

1115
00:53:24,817 --> 00:53:28,047
- Don't pester me now, please.
- His Honor won't say anything.

1116
00:53:28,253 --> 00:53:30,117
- Have you seen Hartwell?
- Hard to tell.

1117
00:53:30,322 --> 00:53:32,152
There's so many
cockroaches around...

1118
00:53:32,358 --> 00:53:34,222
Wait a minute.
How about a statement?

1119
00:53:34,425 --> 00:53:38,123
- We go to press in 20 minutes.
- I've nothing to say. Not now.

1120
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:40,559
Just a moment. What do you know
about the escape?

1121
00:53:40,766 --> 00:53:42,893
- Where'd he get the gun?
- Not so fast.

1122
00:53:43,101 --> 00:53:45,570
- About the election...
- What effect will this have?

1123
00:53:45,771 --> 00:53:47,170
None whatsoever.

1124
00:53:47,373 --> 00:53:49,773
How can an unavoidable
misfortune like this...

1125
00:53:49,974 --> 00:53:53,536
...have any influence on the upright
citizens of our fair city?

1126
00:53:53,746 --> 00:53:56,681
Mr. Mayor, please, is there
a Red Menace or ain't there?

1127
00:53:56,882 --> 00:53:58,543
How did Williams get out?

1128
00:53:58,751 --> 00:54:01,219
Have you picked out somebody
to be responsible?

1129
00:54:01,420 --> 00:54:03,980
Any truth in the report
you're on Stalin's payroll?

1130
00:54:04,188 --> 00:54:06,679
The senator claims you
sleep in red underwear.

1131
00:54:06,891 --> 00:54:09,588
Never mind the jokes.
Don't forget I'm the mayor and...

1132
00:54:09,795 --> 00:54:11,353
Hartwell, I want to see you!

1133
00:54:11,563 --> 00:54:12,586
How'd he get away?

1134
00:54:12,797 --> 00:54:14,163
Where'd he get the gun?

1135
00:54:14,365 --> 00:54:16,800
Any statement on the
Red Uprising tomorrow?

1136
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:19,266
- Red Uprising?
- There will be no Red Uprising.

1137
00:54:19,472 --> 00:54:22,338
The governor says the situation
calls for the militia.

1138
00:54:22,541 --> 00:54:26,034
I say anything the governor says
is a tissue of lies.

1139
00:54:26,246 --> 00:54:28,942
Here's a red-hot
statement from the governor.

1140
00:54:29,148 --> 00:54:31,583
He claims the mayor and
sheriff have shown themselves...

1141
00:54:31,784 --> 00:54:34,777
...to be a couple of eight-year-olds
playing with fire.

1142
00:54:35,954 --> 00:54:37,820
You can quote him as follows:

1143
00:54:38,023 --> 00:54:40,958
"It's lucky for the city that
next Tuesday is Election Day...

1144
00:54:41,161 --> 00:54:43,891
...as the citizens will thus be saved
the expense of impeaching...

1145
00:54:44,097 --> 00:54:46,929
...the mayor and the sheriff".
That's all. Call you back.

1146
00:54:47,132 --> 00:54:48,862
Nice to have seen you, Mayor.

1147
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:52,469
- Excuse me, I've got so much to do.
- Wait. Who engineered this getaway?

1148
00:54:52,672 --> 00:54:54,139
- Was it the Reds?
- Was it you?

1149
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:56,900
Me? Just a minute.
I'll tell you. I've got him located.

1150
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:58,110
- Williams?
- Where?

1151
00:54:58,177 --> 00:55:00,112
Out on Center Street.
I just got a tip.

1152
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:02,543
- Why didn't you say so?
- The rifle squad is going out.

1153
00:55:02,748 --> 00:55:04,512
You'll catch him if you hurry.

1154
00:55:04,717 --> 00:55:06,445
- Look, please...
- Pete, I want to talk to you.

1155
00:55:06,652 --> 00:55:07,820
I've got so much to do.

1156
00:55:08,420 --> 00:55:10,251
- See here, Fred...
- Pete, you're through.

1157
00:55:10,456 --> 00:55:11,753
Through? You mean I'm through?

1158
00:55:11,958 --> 00:55:14,016
I'm scratching your name
off the ticket...

1159
00:55:14,226 --> 00:55:15,922
...and running
Sherman in your place.

1160
00:55:16,128 --> 00:55:19,427
"Reform the Red with a rope"!
Williams isn't a Red and you know it!

1161
00:55:19,632 --> 00:55:22,065
But there's Communistic
sympathizers and I thought...

1162
00:55:22,268 --> 00:55:24,327
...if I got a slogan
like that I could...

1163
00:55:24,536 --> 00:55:26,766
That's got nothing to
do with this case.

1164
00:55:26,972 --> 00:55:30,739
There are 200,000 votes at stake.
If he don't hang, we'll lose them.

1165
00:55:30,943 --> 00:55:33,574
We're going to hang him.
He can't get away.

1166
00:55:33,780 --> 00:55:36,179
What do you mean?
He did get away, didn't he?

1167
00:55:36,382 --> 00:55:38,110
What do you want?

1168
00:55:38,318 --> 00:55:40,342
- What do you want?
- Are you Sheriff Hartwell?

1169
00:55:40,552 --> 00:55:42,179
I'm him. What is it?

1170
00:55:42,387 --> 00:55:46,016
You're a hard man to find.
I have a message from the governor.

1171
00:55:46,226 --> 00:55:48,489
- What?
- It was a reprieve for Earl Williams.

1172
00:55:48,695 --> 00:55:50,184
- For who?
- Earl Williams.

1173
00:55:50,396 --> 00:55:52,762
You said there wasn't going
to be a reprieve.

1174
00:55:52,965 --> 00:55:56,423
It frightens me to think of what
I'd like to do to you. Who was there?

1175
00:55:56,635 --> 00:55:58,797
- Nobody. He was fishing.
- Get the governor on the phone.

1176
00:55:59,005 --> 00:56:00,802
He's not there.
He's duck shooting.

1177
00:56:01,007 --> 00:56:03,668
Blasted nimrod!
Fishing, duck shooting...

1178
00:56:03,876 --> 00:56:06,471
A guy who's done nothing
for the last 40 years...

1179
00:56:06,679 --> 00:56:08,704
...gets elected governor
and he's a Tarzan.

1180
00:56:08,914 --> 00:56:12,315
Read that. "Insane". He knows
very well Williams isn't insane.

1181
00:56:12,518 --> 00:56:14,179
I never met the man.

1182
00:56:14,387 --> 00:56:16,684
- Pure politics.
- It's an attempt to ruin us.

1183
00:56:16,889 --> 00:56:18,356
What do we tell the reporters?

1184
00:56:18,557 --> 00:56:21,288
Tell them the party is through
on account of you.

1185
00:56:21,494 --> 00:56:24,394
As an afterthought, tell them
I want your resignation now.

1186
00:56:24,597 --> 00:56:26,724
Hello. Yes, yes, this is Hartwell.

1187
00:56:26,932 --> 00:56:28,264
What? Where?

1188
00:56:29,369 --> 00:56:30,927
Holy Moses! Hold the wire!

1189
00:56:31,137 --> 00:56:32,364
They've got Williams!

1190
00:56:32,572 --> 00:56:34,436
The rifle squad has him
at his house.

1191
00:56:34,641 --> 00:56:37,007
- Tell them to hold the phone.
- Hold the wire.

1192
00:56:37,210 --> 00:56:40,202
- Cover up that transmitter.
- No. Now, listen.

1193
00:56:40,413 --> 00:56:41,744
You never arrived with this.

1194
00:56:41,947 --> 00:56:43,813
Yes, I did. I came through
that door...

1195
00:56:44,016 --> 00:56:46,451
- How much do you make?
- I thought he was sheriff...

1196
00:56:46,652 --> 00:56:48,382
- What's your salary?
- $40 a week.

1197
00:56:48,588 --> 00:56:51,751
How'd you like to make $350 a month?
That's almost $100 a week.

1198
00:56:51,958 --> 00:56:53,822
I couldn't afford that. Who? Me?

1199
00:56:54,027 --> 00:56:56,996
They need a fellow like you
in the city sealer's office.

1200
00:56:57,195 --> 00:56:58,356
- The what?
- City sealer's.

1201
00:56:58,565 --> 00:57:00,465
You mean I should work
in the sealer's...

1202
00:57:00,666 --> 00:57:05,070
My wife wouldn't like that. She lives
in the country with my family.

1203
00:57:05,271 --> 00:57:09,105
That's all right. Bring her in.
We'll pay all the expenses.

1204
00:57:09,309 --> 00:57:11,242
- I don't think so.
- Why not?

1205
00:57:11,443 --> 00:57:14,844
I got two kids in school. If they
change towns, they'll lose a grade...

1206
00:57:15,047 --> 00:57:16,538
No. They'll skip a grade.

1207
00:57:16,748 --> 00:57:19,012
And I guarantee you
that they'll graduate...

1208
00:57:19,217 --> 00:57:21,117
Hold your horses, Olsen.
Hurry up, Fred.

1209
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,447
Now, what do you say?

1210
00:57:22,655 --> 00:57:24,384
That puts me in a peculiar hole.

1211
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:26,751
No, it doesn't.
You never delivered this.

1212
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,155
You got caught in traffic
or something.

1213
00:57:29,362 --> 00:57:30,989
- No, I came...
- Pretend you didn't.

1214
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:33,664
Now get out and don't let
anybody see you.

1215
00:57:33,865 --> 00:57:36,266
- But how do I know...
- Come to my office tomorrow.

1216
00:57:36,469 --> 00:57:37,958
- What's your name?
- Pettibone.

1217
00:57:38,170 --> 00:57:39,467
- Pettibone?
- Not really.

1218
00:57:39,672 --> 00:57:41,572
Lay low and keep your mouth shut.

1219
00:57:41,773 --> 00:57:43,764
- I'm tired anyhow.
- Go to this address.

1220
00:57:43,976 --> 00:57:45,137
Nice homey place.

1221
00:57:45,344 --> 00:57:47,643
They'll take care of you.
Tell them Fred sent you.

1222
00:57:47,847 --> 00:57:50,907
- Here's $50 on account.
- Wait, I'll tell you in one minute.

1223
00:57:51,117 --> 00:57:53,585
You forgot to tell me
what a city sealer does.

1224
00:57:53,786 --> 00:57:55,447
- Is it hard?
- Easy. Very easy.

1225
00:57:55,655 --> 00:57:57,679
Good, because my health isn't
what my wife...

1226
00:57:57,889 --> 00:57:59,447
- We'll fix that too.
- My wife?

1227
00:57:59,659 --> 00:58:01,717
Yes, fix anything. Go ahead.

1228
00:58:01,927 --> 00:58:03,327
They're still on the phone.

1229
00:58:03,528 --> 00:58:07,295
- Tell them to shoot to kill.
- But the reprieve!

1230
00:58:07,500 --> 00:58:09,865
- Go ahead and do as I tell you.
- Hello, Olsen.

1231
00:58:10,068 --> 00:58:12,594
Shoot to kill. That's the orders.
Pass the word along.

1232
00:58:12,804 --> 00:58:15,295
- $500 reward.
- $500 for the man who does it.

1233
00:58:15,507 --> 00:58:16,838
I'll be right over.

1234
00:58:19,411 --> 00:58:20,503
Hi, Hildy.

1235
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:22,737
You double-crossing hyena.

1236
00:58:22,949 --> 00:58:25,076
What'd you pull on
Mr. Baldwin this time?

1237
00:58:25,284 --> 00:58:27,184
- Who, me?
- You and that albino of yours.

1238
00:58:27,387 --> 00:58:30,014
- Evangeline's no albino.
- She'll do, till one comes along.

1239
00:58:30,222 --> 00:58:31,849
She was born in this country.

1240
00:58:32,057 --> 00:58:35,789
If she tries anything else,
she'll have to stay in this country.

1241
00:58:35,994 --> 00:58:39,431
- Did you bring that money?
- Oh, yeah, $400.

1242
00:58:39,632 --> 00:58:41,030
$450.

1243
00:58:41,467 --> 00:58:44,527
All right, you can't blame
a guy for trying.

1244
00:58:44,737 --> 00:58:46,364
- Give me a receipt.
- I'll give you a scar.

1245
00:58:46,572 --> 00:58:47,800
You got plenty of them.

1246
00:58:48,007 --> 00:58:49,702
I'll take Mr. Baldwin's wallet too.

1247
00:58:49,909 --> 00:58:52,469
- Mr. Baldwin's what?
- His purse. Come on, Louie.

1248
00:58:52,679 --> 00:58:56,012
All right, Hildy. I'll do it for you
because I like you.

1249
00:58:56,215 --> 00:58:59,240
But tell your financier to be
more careful, know what I mean?

1250
00:58:59,452 --> 00:59:01,784
I'll loan him a pair of
your brass knuckles.

1251
00:59:01,987 --> 00:59:03,887
Don't talk that way.
I'll take that.

1252
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:06,057
- I'll take it to the station.
- Wait a minute!

1253
00:59:06,259 --> 00:59:09,523
Take it to the 27th Precinct
and tell the cops how this happened.

1254
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:11,958
I couldn't do that.
Burns would turn me in.

1255
00:59:12,164 --> 00:59:13,893
- Not a bad idea.
- Here, catch!

1256
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:15,226
Louie!

1257
00:59:24,309 --> 00:59:27,005
Hello, operator. Hildy Johnson.
Will you get me...

1258
00:59:27,213 --> 00:59:28,873
Drop that phone!

1259
00:59:29,081 --> 00:59:30,344
Never mind.

1260
00:59:31,284 --> 00:59:33,114
You won't tell anybody where I am.

1261
00:59:37,255 --> 00:59:39,485
Put that gun down, Earl.

1262
00:59:41,293 --> 00:59:43,922
You don't want to shoot me.
I'm your friend, remember?

1263
00:59:44,130 --> 00:59:46,860
I'm writing the story on you
of production for use.

1264
00:59:47,065 --> 00:59:50,661
- That's right. Production for use.
- You don't want to hurt your...

1265
00:59:50,869 --> 00:59:53,338
Don't move!
Maybe you're my friend, maybe not.

1266
00:59:53,773 --> 00:59:55,034
But don't come nearer.

1267
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,902
You can't trust anybody
in this crazy world.

1268
00:59:58,110 --> 01:00:01,239
I don't blame you.
I wouldn't trust anybody either.

1269
01:00:01,447 --> 01:00:04,143
Don't do that.
Put it back. Put it back.

1270
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:08,251
If you try any tricks, I'll shoot you.
I can do it right from here.

1271
01:00:09,288 --> 01:00:12,052
Sure you could, Earl.
But you don't want to do that.

1272
01:00:12,257 --> 01:00:13,724
You don't want to kill anybody.

1273
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:17,128
No, you're right.
I don't want to kill anybody.

1274
01:00:17,329 --> 01:00:20,594
- That's what I thought.
- Wait a minute. Where are you going?

1275
01:00:20,800 --> 01:00:22,927
I was going to close the door
so nobody'd see you.

1276
01:00:23,135 --> 01:00:25,070
No, you weren't.
You were going to get somebody.

1277
01:00:25,271 --> 01:00:27,637
But I don't want that.
All I want is to be left alone.

1278
01:00:27,840 --> 01:00:29,273
- I won't get anybody.
- You will.

1279
01:00:29,474 --> 01:00:32,773
You'll get them after me again.
I won't let you do that. I won't...

1280
01:00:35,614 --> 01:00:37,913
- Give me that.
- I guess I fired all the shells.

1281
01:00:38,617 --> 01:00:41,985
- I'm awful tired.
- That shot. They'll know you're here.

1282
01:00:42,188 --> 01:00:43,382
I don't care.

1283
01:00:43,588 --> 01:00:47,355
I'm not afraid to die. I told the
guy that when he handed me the gun.

1284
01:00:47,559 --> 01:00:49,789
- Quiet!
- Waking me in the middle of the night.

1285
01:00:49,996 --> 01:00:51,759
Talking about things
they don't understand.

1286
01:00:51,963 --> 01:00:53,192
Shut up.

1287
01:00:53,398 --> 01:00:55,525
I wish they'd take me back
and hang me.

1288
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:57,429
They will if you don't keep quiet.

1289
01:00:57,637 --> 01:00:59,467
I couldn't go through
another day like this.

1290
01:00:59,672 --> 01:01:00,831
You think I could?

1291
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:04,903
Get me Walter Burns, quick.
Tell him I need him.

1292
01:01:08,213 --> 01:01:11,547
Bruce, I know I said I'd be down,
but something terrific has happened.

1293
01:01:11,751 --> 01:01:13,150
Walter, come right away.

1294
01:01:13,351 --> 01:01:14,717
Wait, Bruce, I'll explain.

1295
01:01:14,920 --> 01:01:17,150
I've got Earl Williams here,
in the press room.

1296
01:01:17,356 --> 01:01:18,914
On the level.
Hurry, I need you!

1297
01:01:19,125 --> 01:01:22,150
Bruce, I've captured Earl Williams.
You know, the murderer.

1298
01:01:22,360 --> 01:01:24,829
Stay there, Earl. Wait.
Bruce, I'll be down.

1299
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:26,965
As soon as I hand him
to the paper.

1300
01:01:27,166 --> 01:01:29,657
Bruce, I can't.
Don't you realize...

1301
01:01:31,036 --> 01:01:34,403
- Who is it?
- Me, Mollie Malloy. Open the door!

1302
01:01:35,340 --> 01:01:37,740
- What do you want, Mollie?
- I got to find...

1303
01:01:37,943 --> 01:01:39,672
- Where is everybody?
- They've gone.

1304
01:01:39,878 --> 01:01:41,436
Please tell me where.

1305
01:01:41,646 --> 01:01:43,342
I don't know,
and I'm awfully busy.

1306
01:01:43,548 --> 01:01:46,244
They got him surrounded.
They'll shoot him down like a dog.

1307
01:01:46,452 --> 01:01:47,918
They're looking for you too.

1308
01:01:48,119 --> 01:01:50,610
I don't care. Tell me.
I ain't afraid of them.

1309
01:01:50,822 --> 01:01:53,586
All right, they're down at
Center Street and Fourth.

1310
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,887
- Oh, that's where I used to...
- Mollie, Mollie, don't go.

1311
01:01:57,096 --> 01:01:59,496
Come in, Mollie. Draw up a chair.

1312
01:02:01,934 --> 01:02:03,833
- Hello.
- How did you get in here?

1313
01:02:04,036 --> 01:02:08,530
Down the pipe. I didn't mean to
shoot him. Really, I didn't.

1314
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:10,800
- Be quiet.
- You believe me, don't you?

1315
01:02:11,010 --> 01:02:12,135
Sure, I believe you.

1316
01:02:12,344 --> 01:02:14,938
Thanks for the roses.
They were beautiful.

1317
01:02:15,146 --> 01:02:17,980
That's all right, Mr. Williams.

1318
01:02:19,552 --> 01:02:21,679
- Don't cry.
- Don't you get hysterical.

1319
01:02:21,887 --> 01:02:23,286
I want to get him out.

1320
01:02:23,489 --> 01:02:26,322
- You wouldn't get down that hall.
- But they'll find him.

1321
01:02:26,525 --> 01:02:29,516
I know. I'm trying to think
before those reporters come back.

1322
01:02:29,728 --> 01:02:31,525
Let them take me.
What's the difference?

1323
01:02:31,731 --> 01:02:33,322
I'll never let them.

1324
01:02:34,199 --> 01:02:35,690
Who locked the door?

1325
01:02:36,936 --> 01:02:39,403
- Now it's too late.
- It isn't. Get in this desk.

1326
01:02:39,605 --> 01:02:41,731
- Oh, what's the use?
- Come on, get in.

1327
01:02:45,610 --> 01:02:47,340
We'll get you out in ten minutes.

1328
01:02:48,179 --> 01:02:51,307
Pull yourself together.
All right, here. Sit down.

1329
01:02:52,385 --> 01:02:55,182
All right, all right,
I'm coming!

1330
01:02:56,856 --> 01:03:00,313
- Don't kick the building down.
- We got phone calls to make.

1331
01:03:00,525 --> 01:03:02,221
What's she doing up here?

1332
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:03,724
What's the matter?

1333
01:03:03,929 --> 01:03:05,864
Came up here and had hysterics.

1334
01:03:06,065 --> 01:03:07,998
- How do you feel, kid?
- Not so good.

1335
01:03:08,199 --> 01:03:09,427
Get you some water?

1336
01:03:09,635 --> 01:03:12,068
- Do anything for you?
- You don't look so sick.

1337
01:03:12,271 --> 01:03:14,398
- Did you bump into Williams?
- Funny!

1338
01:03:14,606 --> 01:03:16,335
- Where is he?
- Let me alone.

1339
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:19,010
- Okay. Give me the desk.
- No harm in asking.

1340
01:03:19,210 --> 01:03:22,806
Hello, Jim. Yes, false alarm.
They surrounded the house, all right...

1341
01:03:23,014 --> 01:03:24,641
...but Williams wasn't there.

1342
01:03:24,849 --> 01:03:27,409
The Halloween outside has the
police standing on its ear.

1343
01:03:27,619 --> 01:03:30,110
- I thought you were gone.
- I'm waiting for money from Walter.

1344
01:03:30,322 --> 01:03:32,188
What a chase! Give me Emil.

1345
01:03:32,391 --> 01:03:34,483
- Give me the desk.
- Any news, boys?

1346
01:03:34,693 --> 01:03:36,923
Yeah, I never been
so tired in my life.

1347
01:03:37,128 --> 01:03:38,527
What? Where?
Melrose Station?

1348
01:03:38,731 --> 01:03:40,960
All right, connect me.
Hello, Mollie. How are you?

1349
01:03:41,166 --> 01:03:43,135
Hold it a minute.
This looks good.

1350
01:03:43,335 --> 01:03:46,429
An old lady claims Williams
is hiding under her piazza.

1351
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:48,163
Tell her to stand up.

1352
01:03:48,541 --> 01:03:51,065
- You want to go out on it?
- I'll cover this end.

1353
01:03:51,277 --> 01:03:54,541
- I spent $1.40 on taxicabs already.
- No more going out.

1354
01:03:54,746 --> 01:03:57,079
- Never mind, Sarge.
- Who pulled the shades down?

1355
01:03:57,282 --> 01:03:59,114
They were throwing
those lights around.

1356
01:04:05,858 --> 01:04:07,951
You know, I've got
a hunch Williams...

1357
01:04:08,159 --> 01:04:10,150
...ain't anywhere they've been
looking for him.

1358
01:04:10,362 --> 01:04:12,092
He might be here in this building.

1359
01:04:12,297 --> 01:04:15,528
Sure, sure, hanging around
like a duck in a shooting gallery.

1360
01:04:15,735 --> 01:04:18,168
From the skylight, but
how did he reach the ground?

1361
01:04:18,371 --> 01:04:22,364
- I'm pretending there ain't any Earl.
- He could have jumped to this roof.

1362
01:04:22,574 --> 01:04:24,940
From the roof he could slide
down the drainpipe.

1363
01:04:25,143 --> 01:04:26,907
And come in any of these windows.

1364
01:04:27,112 --> 01:04:28,773
If the story walks in the window...

1365
01:04:28,981 --> 01:04:32,576
Masterminds. Why don't you go home?
Maybe Williams will call on you.

1366
01:04:32,851 --> 01:04:34,820
It'd be funny if he was
in this building.

1367
01:04:35,021 --> 01:04:36,715
Why not search the building?

1368
01:04:36,922 --> 01:04:40,221
- I am not wandering all over.
- A great bunch of reporters you are.

1369
01:04:40,425 --> 01:04:42,586
Too lazy to go after
the biggest story in years.

1370
01:04:42,795 --> 01:04:45,286
You seem pretty anxious
to get rid of us.

1371
01:04:45,498 --> 01:04:48,092
- Are you trying to scoop us?
- Are you crazy? On my time?

1372
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:52,327
Maybe Mollie's been giving her
the truth on how Williams got the gun.

1373
01:04:52,538 --> 01:04:53,561
I didn't do nothing.

1374
01:04:53,773 --> 01:04:55,797
- Come clean.
- Let the girl alone. She's...

1375
01:04:56,007 --> 01:04:57,235
Well?

1376
01:04:57,443 --> 01:04:58,932
Mrs. Baldwin. Mother.

1377
01:04:59,144 --> 01:05:02,978
Don't "mother" me. Playing cat and
mouse and keeping my boy locked up.

1378
01:05:03,181 --> 01:05:06,014
Making us miss two trains, and you
supposed to be married tomorrow.

1379
01:05:06,217 --> 01:05:09,710
- I'll be with you in five minutes...
- Just give me Bruce's money.

1380
01:05:09,922 --> 01:05:13,380
You can stay here forever,
you and that murderer you caught.

1381
01:05:13,592 --> 01:05:15,786
- Murderer?
- Which one of these men is it?

1382
01:05:15,994 --> 01:05:18,759
- They all look like murderers.
- What murderer did you catch?

1383
01:05:18,963 --> 01:05:20,864
I never said any such thing.

1384
01:05:21,067 --> 01:05:23,626
I'm quoting my son.
He has never lied to me.

1385
01:05:23,835 --> 01:05:24,835
Somebody's lying.

1386
01:05:25,036 --> 01:05:27,436
- I never said anything like that.
- Yes, you did.

1387
01:05:27,639 --> 01:05:30,074
I said I was trying
to find the murderer.

1388
01:05:30,275 --> 01:05:32,266
- Quit stalling.
- She's got it balled up.

1389
01:05:32,478 --> 01:05:34,070
Who are you holding out on?

1390
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,110
Nobody. Now let me go, will you?

1391
01:05:36,548 --> 01:05:38,072
Stop it, stop it!

1392
01:05:38,284 --> 01:05:42,277
She don't know where he is.
I'm the only one that knows.

1393
01:05:42,487 --> 01:05:43,978
- Where's Williams?
- Try and find out.

1394
01:05:44,190 --> 01:05:46,784
- Come on, talk.
- Now you want me to talk?

1395
01:05:46,992 --> 01:05:48,619
- Talk.
- Ain't that funny?

1396
01:05:48,827 --> 01:05:52,228
You wouldn't listen to me before,
and now you want me to talk.

1397
01:05:52,431 --> 01:05:53,431
Don't say anything.

1398
01:05:53,599 --> 01:05:55,362
- I know what I'm doing.
- Stay out of this.

1399
01:05:55,568 --> 01:05:57,865
- Why didn't you listen to me?
- Cut that out.

1400
01:05:58,070 --> 01:05:59,594
- Hands off!
- Where is he?

1401
01:05:59,804 --> 01:06:03,297
Why do you want to know? So you can
write more lies to sell papers?

1402
01:06:03,509 --> 01:06:07,309
- Never mind that.
- All right. I'll give you a story.

1403
01:06:07,512 --> 01:06:08,570
A wonderful story!

1404
01:06:08,780 --> 01:06:12,512
Only this time it'll be true.
You'll never find me now!

1405
01:06:12,918 --> 01:06:14,681
Get the ambulance, somebody!

1406
01:06:14,887 --> 01:06:16,615
Get an ambulance, somebody!

1407
01:06:20,291 --> 01:06:23,523
- She's dead.
- No, she isn't killed, she's moving!

1408
01:06:27,932 --> 01:06:30,958
- Did you see that? She jumped.
- I know that.

1409
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:32,568
Where have you got Williams?

1410
01:06:32,771 --> 01:06:34,795
Hidden. He's in the desk.

1411
01:06:35,007 --> 01:06:36,304
She didn't kill herself.

1412
01:06:36,509 --> 01:06:37,998
- How're you doing?
- Let me out.

1413
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:39,836
Quiet. You're sitting pretty.

1414
01:06:40,045 --> 01:06:41,773
- What's in there?
- Who are you?

1415
01:06:41,981 --> 01:06:44,074
- This is Bruce's mother.
- What are you doing?

1416
01:06:44,282 --> 01:06:46,342
- Shut up!
- You're doing something wrong.

1417
01:06:46,552 --> 01:06:48,543
- Mother, please.
- Take her out of here.

1418
01:06:48,753 --> 01:06:52,690
- Take the lady to Polack Mike's.
- My name's Louie Peluso.

1419
01:06:54,460 --> 01:06:56,621
See that she doesn't talk to anyone.

1420
01:06:56,829 --> 01:06:58,456
Tell them it's a case of D.T.'s.

1421
01:06:58,664 --> 01:07:00,632
Don't worry, Mother.
It's only temporary.

1422
01:07:01,132 --> 01:07:02,896
Let go of me.

1423
01:07:03,536 --> 01:07:06,266
- Where are you going?
- To get Bruce out of jail.

1424
01:07:06,472 --> 01:07:10,101
- Why did you do this to me?
- Get Bruce out of jail?

1425
01:07:10,309 --> 01:07:13,641
How can you worry about a man
who's resting in a police station?

1426
01:07:13,846 --> 01:07:16,871
- This is war! You can't desert me.
- Get off that trapeze.

1427
01:07:17,081 --> 01:07:18,481
You've got your story.

1428
01:07:18,684 --> 01:07:21,447
<i>"Earl Williams captured
by the Morning Post".</i>

1429
01:07:21,653 --> 01:07:24,179
I covered your story for you,
now I'm getting out.

1430
01:07:24,389 --> 01:07:28,985
You drooling idiot, there are 365 days
in a year one can get married.

1431
01:07:29,195 --> 01:07:32,130
How many times you got a murderer
locked up in a desk?

1432
01:07:32,331 --> 01:07:34,697
You got the whole city
by the seat of the pants.

1433
01:07:34,900 --> 01:07:36,958
You've got the brain of a pancake.

1434
01:07:37,168 --> 01:07:39,693
This isn't just a story.
It's a revolution.

1435
01:07:39,905 --> 01:07:42,771
The greatest yarn since
Livingston discovered Stanley.

1436
01:07:42,974 --> 01:07:46,637
- The other way around.
- Don't get technical at such a time.

1437
01:07:46,844 --> 01:07:49,746
You've taken a city that's been
graft-ridden for 40 years...

1438
01:07:49,949 --> 01:07:53,043
...and given us a chance to have
the same kind of government...

1439
01:07:53,251 --> 01:07:54,809
...New York has under La Guardia.

1440
01:07:55,019 --> 01:07:59,081
If I didn't have your best interest
at heart, I wouldn't argue with you.

1441
01:07:59,291 --> 01:08:03,056
You've done something big.
You've stepped up into a new class.

1442
01:08:03,262 --> 01:08:07,130
We'll make such monkeys of those
ward healers nobody'll vote for them.

1443
01:08:07,333 --> 01:08:09,197
- Expose them?
- We'll crucify that mob.

1444
01:08:09,400 --> 01:08:12,393
We'll keep Williams under cover,
until we can break the story...

1445
01:08:12,605 --> 01:08:14,505
...then share the glory
with the governor.

1446
01:08:14,706 --> 01:08:17,301
- I get it, I get it.
- You'll kick over City Hall.

1447
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:21,444
You got the mayor and Hartwell
backed up against the wall.

1448
01:08:21,646 --> 01:08:24,479
This isn't just a newspaper story.
It's a career!

1449
01:08:24,682 --> 01:08:27,880
And you bellyache about catching
the eight or nine o'clock train.

1450
01:08:28,087 --> 01:08:31,783
- But I never figured it that way.
- Because you're a doll-faced hick.

1451
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:35,483
They'll be naming streets after you.
There'll be statues of you.

1452
01:08:35,694 --> 01:08:38,856
The movies will be after you.
There'll be a Hildy Johnson cigar.

1453
01:08:39,064 --> 01:08:42,363
I can see the billboards now:
"Light up with Hildy Johnson..."

1454
01:08:42,568 --> 01:08:44,364
- We got a lot to do.
- Now you're talking.

1455
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:48,631
- We can't leave Williams here.
- We'll take him to my private office.

1456
01:08:48,841 --> 01:08:51,900
- How are you going to take him?
- We'll carry the desk over.

1457
01:08:52,110 --> 01:08:53,703
It's crawling with cops outside.

1458
01:08:53,912 --> 01:08:56,106
We'll lower it out
the window with pulleys.

1459
01:08:56,314 --> 01:08:58,043
Start pounding out a lead!

1460
01:08:58,250 --> 01:09:02,208
- How much of this stuff do you want?
- All you the words you got.

1461
01:09:02,421 --> 01:09:05,753
- Can I call the mayor a bird of prey?
- Call him anything you like.

1462
01:09:05,957 --> 01:09:10,019
Give him the works. Hello, Duffy?
We got the biggest story in years.

1463
01:09:10,229 --> 01:09:13,595
<i>"Earl Williams captured by
the Morning Post. Exclusive!"</i>

1464
01:09:13,798 --> 01:09:15,528
Tear out the whole front page.

1465
01:09:15,734 --> 01:09:18,828
The whole front page. Out!
And never mind the European war.

1466
01:09:19,037 --> 01:09:22,667
We got something bigger than that.
Hildy Johnson's writing the lead.

1467
01:09:22,875 --> 01:09:24,774
And get hold of Butch O'Connor.

1468
01:09:24,976 --> 01:09:27,207
Tell him to come up here
with his wrestlers.

1469
01:09:27,412 --> 01:09:28,505
Yeah, Butch O'Connor.

1470
01:09:28,713 --> 01:09:30,648
What? I've got a desk
I want moved...

1471
01:09:30,849 --> 01:09:32,213
What the deuce do you want?

1472
01:09:32,417 --> 01:09:33,578
- Hello, Bruce.
- Hildy.

1473
01:09:33,786 --> 01:09:36,083
Never mind the Chinese earthquake.

1474
01:09:36,287 --> 01:09:38,779
- I just want to ask you...
- How'd you get out of jail?

1475
01:09:38,990 --> 01:09:40,720
Not through any help of yours.

1476
01:09:40,926 --> 01:09:42,119
I'm not talking to you.

1477
01:09:42,328 --> 01:09:46,525
I had to wire Albany for $100
so I could get out on bail.

1478
01:09:47,099 --> 01:09:50,431
What will they think in Albany?
The money went to the police station.

1479
01:09:50,636 --> 01:09:54,002
- We're waiting for that story.
- We'll explain everything to them.

1480
01:09:54,206 --> 01:09:55,969
- Where's mother?
- She left.

1481
01:09:56,175 --> 01:09:57,175
I can't hear you.

1482
01:09:57,342 --> 01:09:58,832
- Where'd she go?
- Out someplace.

1483
01:09:59,043 --> 01:10:02,240
- Junk the Polish Corridor!
- Tell me where my mother was going.

1484
01:10:02,448 --> 01:10:04,574
- She couldn't say.
- This is more important.

1485
01:10:04,783 --> 01:10:07,114
- Did she get the money?
- She left in a hurry.

1486
01:10:07,319 --> 01:10:08,979
- I'll take that money.
- In my purse.

1487
01:10:09,188 --> 01:10:12,315
I can handle things.
I'll take that certified check too.

1488
01:10:12,524 --> 01:10:15,960
I'll give you the tickets.
You'll find your money in the wallet.

1489
01:10:16,161 --> 01:10:18,425
My wallet? This is my wallet.

1490
01:10:18,630 --> 01:10:21,530
Say, there's something funny going on...
What are you doing?

1491
01:10:21,734 --> 01:10:23,634
Just wanted to look at it.

1492
01:10:23,836 --> 01:10:25,530
Hildy, I'm taking...

1493
01:10:26,238 --> 01:10:28,967
- I'm taking the 9 o'clock train.
- Sure, sure.

1494
01:10:29,173 --> 01:10:32,506
Did you hear what I said?
I said I am taking the 9 o'clock...

1495
01:10:32,711 --> 01:10:34,542
Oh, Bruce, I put it in here!

1496
01:10:36,582 --> 01:10:38,481
Let her alone, will you, buddy.

1497
01:10:38,684 --> 01:10:41,208
- Do me a favor...
- Just answer one question.

1498
01:10:41,420 --> 01:10:43,387
You don't want to come
with me, do you?

1499
01:10:43,588 --> 01:10:44,988
Answer me.
You don't, do you?

1500
01:10:45,189 --> 01:10:47,783
No. Take the Miss America
pictures off page six.

1501
01:10:47,993 --> 01:10:49,893
Hildy, tell me.
Tell me the truth.

1502
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:53,029
Wait a minute.
Now look here, my good man...

1503
01:10:53,231 --> 01:10:54,893
You shut up, Burns.

1504
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:56,623
You're doing all this to her.

1505
01:10:56,835 --> 01:10:58,826
She wanted to get away from you.

1506
01:10:59,037 --> 01:11:01,061
But you caught her
and changed her mind...

1507
01:11:01,273 --> 01:11:03,832
Stick Hitler on the funny page.
Now let me ask you...

1508
01:11:04,042 --> 01:11:06,567
Will you give up everything
for a man like him?

1509
01:11:06,779 --> 01:11:09,247
No, but something's happened.
I'll tell you...

1510
01:11:09,448 --> 01:11:11,472
Tell him nothing.
He's a spy, you fool.

1511
01:11:11,682 --> 01:11:13,014
- I am not a spy.
- Ridiculous.

1512
01:11:13,217 --> 01:11:14,845
You're coming with me right now.

1513
01:11:15,052 --> 01:11:17,715
Just a second. This is the
biggest thing in my life.

1514
01:11:17,922 --> 01:11:20,789
I see. I'll keep.
I'm like something in the icebox.

1515
01:11:20,993 --> 01:11:22,551
You just don't love me.

1516
01:11:22,761 --> 01:11:26,457
That isn't true. Just because you
won't listen you say I don't love you.

1517
01:11:26,664 --> 01:11:29,634
You never intended to be decent
and live like a human being.

1518
01:11:29,835 --> 01:11:32,599
All right, if that's what
you want to think.

1519
01:11:32,805 --> 01:11:34,431
I'm trying to concentrate.

1520
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:37,871
- You're just like him and all the rest.
- Sure. That's what I am.

1521
01:11:38,076 --> 01:11:41,273
What? Leave the rooster story alone.
That's human interest.

1522
01:11:41,814 --> 01:11:43,872
If you had any sympathy
or understanding...

1523
01:11:44,082 --> 01:11:46,050
- I understand, all right...
- Wait a minute.

1524
01:11:46,251 --> 01:11:50,278
There's one question I want to know.
The mayor's first wife's name.

1525
01:11:50,488 --> 01:11:53,048
The one with the wart on her? Fanny.
What, Duffy?

1526
01:11:53,257 --> 01:11:54,850
You never loved me at all.

1527
01:11:55,060 --> 01:11:57,255
Never mind.
You don't work for advertising.

1528
01:11:57,462 --> 01:12:00,261
If you change your mind,
I'm on the 9 o'clock train.

1529
01:12:00,466 --> 01:12:03,435
If you want me, take me as I am.
Don't try to change me.

1530
01:12:03,635 --> 01:12:06,194
I'm no suburban bridge player.
I'm a newspaperman.

1531
01:12:06,404 --> 01:12:08,668
That's it. Keep it coming
as fast as you can.

1532
01:12:08,873 --> 01:12:11,137
Get back in there, you mock turtle.

1533
01:12:13,645 --> 01:12:16,136
You tell Butch it's a matter
of life and death?

1534
01:12:16,347 --> 01:12:19,648
Good. Butch's on his way. We just
have to hold out for 15 minutes.

1535
01:12:19,853 --> 01:12:22,912
- The boys will be back to phone.
- I'll handle them.

1536
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:26,914
God, now the moon's out.

1537
01:12:31,096 --> 01:12:33,895
Fine. Three taps is me.
Don't forget. Got enough air?

1538
01:12:34,100 --> 01:12:37,126
- Not very much.
- That better? You're sitting pretty.

1539
01:12:37,670 --> 01:12:39,934
- How's it coming?
- All right. Where's Bruce?

1540
01:12:40,139 --> 01:12:42,038
- He went out.
- Is he coming back here?

1541
01:12:42,242 --> 01:12:45,074
Certainly. Didn't you hear him?
What have you got so far?

1542
01:12:45,278 --> 01:12:49,112
"While Hartwell's paid gunmen stalked
the city, shooting bystanders...

1543
01:12:49,314 --> 01:12:51,283
...spreading terror,
Williams was lurking..."

1544
01:12:51,484 --> 01:12:54,145
<i>Wait a minute.
Aren't you going to mention the Post?</i>

1545
01:12:54,354 --> 01:12:57,050
- I did. Second paragraph.
- Who reads the second paragraph?

1546
01:12:57,256 --> 01:12:59,690
How long have I been
telling you how to write a story?

1547
01:12:59,893 --> 01:13:00,893
I'm sorry.

1548
01:13:04,663 --> 01:13:06,824
What's the idea of locking this door?

1549
01:13:07,033 --> 01:13:09,057
- Who's that?
- Bensinger. That's his desk.

1550
01:13:09,269 --> 01:13:11,793
Open the door, will you?

1551
01:13:12,005 --> 01:13:14,097
<i>- What's his name?
- Bensinger, of the Tribune.</i>

1552
01:13:14,306 --> 01:13:15,934
<i>- The Tribune?
- Who's in there?</i>

1553
01:13:17,944 --> 01:13:19,502
Haven't you any better sense...?

1554
01:13:19,712 --> 01:13:23,648
Hello. Hello, Mr. Burns. Quite
an honor having you come over here.

1555
01:13:23,850 --> 01:13:27,786
- Hello, Bensinger.
- You know my... I just want to get my...

1556
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:31,012
It's quite a coincidence
seeing you tonight, isn't it?

1557
01:13:31,224 --> 01:13:32,224
How do you mean?

1558
01:13:32,324 --> 01:13:35,192
I was talking to our Mr. Duffy
about you this afternoon.

1559
01:13:35,395 --> 01:13:37,363
Really? Nothing detrimental, I hope.

1560
01:13:37,564 --> 01:13:39,532
On the contrary. On the contrary.

1561
01:13:39,731 --> 01:13:42,529
That was one swell story
you had in the paper this morning.

1562
01:13:42,734 --> 01:13:44,793
Did you care for the
poem, Mr. Burns?

1563
01:13:45,003 --> 01:13:46,994
The poem? The poem was great.

1564
01:13:47,206 --> 01:13:48,604
I liked the ending especially.

1565
01:13:48,807 --> 01:13:50,502
"And all is well outside his cell...

1566
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:52,939
...but in his heart he hears
the hangman calling...

1567
01:13:53,145 --> 01:13:54,145
...the gallows falling...

1568
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:57,145
...and his white-haired
mother's tears".

1569
01:13:57,350 --> 01:13:58,748
- Heartbreaking?
- That's fine.

1570
01:13:58,952 --> 01:14:00,442
Would you like to work for me?

1571
01:14:00,653 --> 01:14:02,018
We can use a man like you.

1572
01:14:02,220 --> 01:14:04,416
All we got are lowbrows
like Johnson here.

1573
01:14:04,623 --> 01:14:07,457
- Are you serious, Mr. Burns?
- Serious? Wait a minute.

1574
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:10,150
Duffy, I'm sending
Mr. Bunsinger over to see you.

1575
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:11,728
- Bensinger.
- Mervyn, isn't it?

1576
01:14:11,930 --> 01:14:14,559
- Yeah... No. Roy. Roy V.
- Certainly.

1577
01:14:14,766 --> 01:14:16,734
Roy V. Bensinger, the poet.

1578
01:14:16,935 --> 01:14:20,837
You wouldn't know. You probably never
heard of Shakespeare either.

1579
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,742
<i>Put Mr. Bensinger on staff.
How much you getting on the Tribune?</i>

1580
01:14:25,944 --> 01:14:27,912
- $75.
- I'll give you $100 and a byline.

1581
01:14:28,113 --> 01:14:31,242
Now you give him everything he wants,
you understand?

1582
01:14:31,451 --> 01:14:35,251
Roy, write me a story from the
point of view of the escaped man.

1583
01:14:35,454 --> 01:14:37,787
He hides, afraid of every sound,
every light.

1584
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:40,481
He hears footsteps, they're closing in.

1585
01:14:40,693 --> 01:14:44,423
- Get the sense of the animal at bay.
- Sort of Jack London style?

1586
01:14:44,631 --> 01:14:47,725
- I'll get my rhyming dictionary.
- It doesn't have to rhyme.

1587
01:14:47,934 --> 01:14:50,095
I'm deeply grateful, Mr. Burns.

1588
01:14:51,738 --> 01:14:54,137
If there's an opening
for a war correspondent...

1589
01:14:54,340 --> 01:14:55,773
<i>...I parler a little French.</i>

1590
01:14:55,975 --> 01:14:58,443
<i>- I'll keep you in mind.
- Au revoir, mon capitain.</i>

1591
01:14:58,645 --> 01:14:59,737
<i>Bonjour.</i>

1592
01:15:03,515 --> 01:15:06,246
"His white-haired mother's tears".
That's the tops.

1593
01:15:06,452 --> 01:15:09,113
Listen, that fellow Bensinger
is on his way right now.

1594
01:15:09,322 --> 01:15:11,756
Handle him with kid gloves.
Have him write poetry.

1595
01:15:11,957 --> 01:15:14,323
We don't want him.
Stall him until the extra's out.

1596
01:15:14,527 --> 01:15:16,619
Say his poetry smells
and kick him downstairs.

1597
01:15:16,828 --> 01:15:18,694
- Double-crosser.
- That'll teach him.

1598
01:15:18,898 --> 01:15:21,024
He won't quit his paper
without giving notice after this.

1599
01:15:21,234 --> 01:15:22,292
- I mean you.
- Me?

1600
01:15:22,502 --> 01:15:24,935
You'd double-cross anybody...
Wait a minute.

1601
01:15:25,137 --> 01:15:28,106
Bruce isn't coming back.
He said he was taking the 9:00 train.

1602
01:15:28,306 --> 01:15:29,796
In that case, he's gone by now.

1603
01:15:30,009 --> 01:15:33,136
Don't sit there like a frozen robin.
Get on with the story.

1604
01:15:33,345 --> 01:15:35,439
We ought to be finished
when Butch gets here.

1605
01:15:35,648 --> 01:15:39,243
How you have messed up my life.
What am I going to do?

1606
01:15:39,452 --> 01:15:41,716
Window's too small.
We'll carry the desk out.

1607
01:15:41,921 --> 01:15:45,152
I'd be on that train right now.
I'm a sap, falling for your line.

1608
01:15:45,358 --> 01:15:48,690
- They'll name streets after me...
- Yes, well, get back to work.

1609
01:15:48,895 --> 01:15:51,386
I'm not going back to work.
Walter, what...?

1610
01:15:52,597 --> 01:15:54,588
- Who is it?
- It's me, boss. It's Louie.

1611
01:15:54,801 --> 01:15:55,824
Louie.

1612
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:59,570
- What's the matter?
- Where's Mrs. Baldwin?

1613
01:15:59,771 --> 01:16:00,898
What happened?

1614
01:16:01,106 --> 01:16:04,940
Down Western Avenue, we was going
65 miles an hour, know what I mean?

1615
01:16:05,144 --> 01:16:06,667
Where's the old lady?

1616
01:16:06,878 --> 01:16:09,506
We run smack into a police patrol.
Busted it in half.

1617
01:16:09,716 --> 01:16:10,909
Was she hurt?

1618
01:16:11,117 --> 01:16:14,143
Can you imagine bumping
into a load of cops?

1619
01:16:14,353 --> 01:16:17,253
- What did you do with her?
- Search me, when I come to...

1620
01:16:17,457 --> 01:16:19,583
You were with her.
You were in the cab.

1621
01:16:19,792 --> 01:16:22,453
- The driver got knocked cold.
- Butterfingers!

1622
01:16:22,662 --> 01:16:25,893
- You handed her over to the cops.
- What do you mean?

1623
01:16:26,099 --> 01:16:27,793
They was on the wrong
side of the street.

1624
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:30,490
Fine. Now she's probably
squawking to the police.

1625
01:16:30,703 --> 01:16:32,761
She's not squawking much.
Know what I mean?

1626
01:16:32,971 --> 01:16:34,701
Don't tell me...
Was she killed?

1627
01:16:34,907 --> 01:16:36,238
Was she? Did you notice?

1628
01:16:36,442 --> 01:16:39,342
Me with a gun on the hip and
a kidnapped lady on my hands...

1629
01:16:39,545 --> 01:16:41,604
...I'm going to ask questions
from cops?

1630
01:16:41,814 --> 01:16:45,271
- You know what I mean?
- Dead, dead. This is the end!

1631
01:16:45,917 --> 01:16:46,917
It's fate.

1632
01:16:46,985 --> 01:16:48,283
What will be will be.

1633
01:16:48,488 --> 01:16:50,284
What am I going to say to Bruce?

1634
01:16:50,489 --> 01:16:51,514
What can I tell him?

1635
01:16:51,724 --> 01:16:54,021
If he loves you, you won't
have to tell him anything.

1636
01:16:54,226 --> 01:16:57,560
Would you rather have had the old
dame drag the police in here?

1637
01:16:57,764 --> 01:16:59,958
I killed her. I'm responsible.

1638
01:17:00,166 --> 01:17:02,327
What am I going to do?
How can I ever face Bruce again?

1639
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:05,265
- Look at me, Hildy.
- I am looking at you, you murderer.

1640
01:17:05,470 --> 01:17:07,734
If it was my own grandmother,
I'd carry on.

1641
01:17:07,939 --> 01:17:10,908
- You know I would, for the paper.
- Louie, where'd it happen?

1642
01:17:11,344 --> 01:17:12,743
Western and 34th.

1643
01:17:12,944 --> 01:17:16,176
- I got to get out of here...
- We can do more here. Be calm.

1644
01:17:16,381 --> 01:17:17,576
Listen...

1645
01:17:19,318 --> 01:17:22,047
- Hello, hello.
- Maine 4557.

1646
01:17:22,255 --> 01:17:24,449
Who? Butch, where are you?

1647
01:17:24,657 --> 01:17:26,318
Mission Hospital?
Receiving room.

1648
01:17:26,525 --> 01:17:28,153
What are you doing there?

1649
01:17:28,360 --> 01:17:30,225
Was an old lady brought in
from a smashup?

1650
01:17:30,429 --> 01:17:33,454
For H. Sebastian, Butch,
it's a matter of life and death.

1651
01:17:33,666 --> 01:17:35,600
- Nobody?
- I can't hear.

1652
01:17:35,801 --> 01:17:39,430
- Morningside 2469.
- You got who? Speak up. A what?

1653
01:17:39,639 --> 01:17:41,903
You can't stop for a dame now!

1654
01:17:42,542 --> 01:17:45,511
I don't care if you've been after her.
Our lives are at stake!

1655
01:17:45,711 --> 01:17:47,872
Are you going to let a woman
come between us?

1656
01:17:48,079 --> 01:17:50,707
Was there an old lady brought in
in an auto smashup?

1657
01:17:50,917 --> 01:17:53,545
Butch, I'd put my arm in fire
for you up to here.

1658
01:17:53,752 --> 01:17:55,152
You can't double-cross me.

1659
01:17:55,354 --> 01:17:56,547
Look around, please.

1660
01:17:56,756 --> 01:17:58,849
All right, put her on.
I'll talk to her.

1661
01:17:59,057 --> 01:18:02,550
Good evening, madam. Now, listen,
you ten-cent glamour girl...

1662
01:18:02,761 --> 01:18:05,229
...you can't keep Butch
from his duty. What's that?

1663
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:08,092
You say that again,
I'll kick you in the teeth!

1664
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:10,131
Say, what kind of language is that?

1665
01:18:10,336 --> 01:18:12,497
Now, look here, you...

1666
01:18:12,704 --> 01:18:14,899
She hung up. What did I say?

1667
01:18:16,108 --> 01:18:18,975
Duffy, how do you like that?
Mousing around with some big...

1668
01:18:19,177 --> 01:18:22,670
- Will you shut up? I'm trying to hear!
- Duffy! That's cooperation.

1669
01:18:24,015 --> 01:18:25,779
Well, where is Duffy?

1670
01:18:26,953 --> 01:18:30,149
Diabetes. I ought to know better than
to hire anybody with a disease.

1671
01:18:30,355 --> 01:18:32,619
Give me Olympia 2136, will you?

1672
01:18:32,824 --> 01:18:34,587
- Yes, boss.
- Louie, it's up to you.

1673
01:18:34,793 --> 01:18:37,387
- Anything you say, boss.
- Get a hold of some guys.

1674
01:18:37,596 --> 01:18:40,963
Anybody with hair on his chest,
get them off the street.

1675
01:18:41,167 --> 01:18:42,497
We got to get that desk out.

1676
01:18:42,702 --> 01:18:45,193
Is it important?
You're the best friend I got.

1677
01:18:45,404 --> 01:18:47,132
- I like you too.
- Then don't fail me.

1678
01:18:47,340 --> 01:18:49,364
Get enough people to move that desk.

1679
01:18:49,574 --> 01:18:51,235
You know me.
Shirt off my back.

1680
01:18:51,444 --> 01:18:53,412
Okay, don't bump into anything.

1681
01:18:53,746 --> 01:18:57,476
- Dumb immigrant is sure to flop on me.
- Try the hospital again.

1682
01:18:57,682 --> 01:18:59,877
If he's not back in five,
we'll carry it alone.

1683
01:19:00,086 --> 01:19:02,179
- Do anything you want.
- There's a million ways.

1684
01:19:02,387 --> 01:19:05,152
- We can have firemen take it out.
- I don't care what you do.

1685
01:19:05,358 --> 01:19:08,793
- Come here. See if we can lift it.
- What? Nobody? Never mind.

1686
01:19:08,994 --> 01:19:10,519
- Are you going to help me?
- No!

1687
01:19:10,729 --> 01:19:13,061
- I'll strain my back.
- I'll find Mrs. Baldwin.

1688
01:19:13,265 --> 01:19:15,291
- Don't open that door!
- I'll go to the morgue...

1689
01:19:15,501 --> 01:19:19,130
- We want to talk to you a minute.
- Let go. What's the idea?

1690
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:20,463
Get your hands off me!

1691
01:19:20,672 --> 01:19:22,640
- Now look here, Johnson...
- Hey, you!

1692
01:19:22,841 --> 01:19:23,841
You mean me?

1693
01:19:23,975 --> 01:19:27,935
Yes, you. What do you mean by
breaking in here like this?

1694
01:19:28,146 --> 01:19:30,707
Don't bluff me. I don't care
what paper you're editor of.

1695
01:19:30,917 --> 01:19:34,318
Let go of me. Something's
happened to my mother-in-law.

1696
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:39,149
- We know what you are up to.
- She and Mollie were in here talking.

1697
01:19:39,358 --> 01:19:41,552
I don't know anything.
And there's been an accident.

1698
01:19:41,761 --> 01:19:44,252
There's something
very peculiar going on here.

1699
01:19:44,462 --> 01:19:46,453
- Now see here...
- Just a moment, Hartwell.

1700
01:19:46,666 --> 01:19:49,498
Make your accusations
in the proper manner.

1701
01:19:49,702 --> 01:19:51,761
Otherwise, I'll have to
ask you to get out.

1702
01:19:51,970 --> 01:19:52,970
Ask me to what?

1703
01:19:53,338 --> 01:19:54,828
Get out.

1704
01:19:55,041 --> 01:19:58,908
You will, eh? Don't let anybody
in or out. We'll see about this.

1705
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:01,944
- Give him the third degree.
- Make them talk and you got Williams.

1706
01:20:02,148 --> 01:20:05,480
I'm going to get to the bottom of this.
Are you going to talk?

1707
01:20:05,685 --> 01:20:08,483
- What do you want me to say?
- What do you know about Williams?

1708
01:20:08,688 --> 01:20:10,622
There. Now we're getting some...

1709
01:20:10,823 --> 01:20:12,984
Take her away.
I got ways to make her talk.

1710
01:20:13,192 --> 01:20:14,750
Don't you dare touch me or...

1711
01:20:15,560 --> 01:20:16,891
- She got a gun!
- Grab it!

1712
01:20:17,095 --> 01:20:18,619
No, you don't. Walter!

1713
01:20:18,831 --> 01:20:21,298
All right, Burns.
I'll take that gun.

1714
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,063
- Where did you get this?
- I can carry a gun.

1715
01:20:25,270 --> 01:20:27,033
- Not this gun.
- I can explain it.

1716
01:20:27,238 --> 01:20:31,231
She was interviewing Williams,
so I gave her a gun to defend herself.

1717
01:20:31,444 --> 01:20:35,380
Interesting. But this is the gun
that Williams shot his way out with.

1718
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:37,980
My good man, are you trying
to make me out a liar?

1719
01:20:38,184 --> 01:20:40,515
I ought to know my own gun,
oughtn't I...?

1720
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,984
- So that's where Williams got it.
- She got it from him.

1721
01:20:43,189 --> 01:20:44,189
Where's Williams?

1722
01:20:44,256 --> 01:20:46,417
- Where is he?
- You're barking up the wrong tree.

1723
01:20:46,625 --> 01:20:48,252
Tell me where he is.

1724
01:20:48,461 --> 01:20:50,827
At the hospital calling on
Professor Egelhoffer...

1725
01:20:51,029 --> 01:20:52,155
...with marshmallows.

1726
01:20:52,364 --> 01:20:55,356
- Where is he?
- Ask the mastermind why he's here.

1727
01:20:55,568 --> 01:20:57,034
What do you know about this?

1728
01:20:57,235 --> 01:20:58,863
My dear fellow...

1729
01:20:59,070 --> 01:21:01,971
<i>...the Morning Post doesn't obstruct
justice or hide criminals.</i>

1730
01:21:02,173 --> 01:21:04,573
- You ought to know that.
- You're under arrest.

1731
01:21:04,777 --> 01:21:06,471
- You too.
- Who's under arrest?

1732
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:09,011
Listen, you square-toed,
pimple-headed spy...

1733
01:21:09,215 --> 01:21:11,274
...do you realize what you're doing?

1734
01:21:11,484 --> 01:21:12,576
I'll show you.

1735
01:21:12,784 --> 01:21:14,844
<i>You and the Post
are obstructing justice.</i>

1736
01:21:15,054 --> 01:21:17,021
I'll see that you're fined $10,000.

1737
01:21:17,222 --> 01:21:18,314
You'll see nothing.

1738
01:21:18,524 --> 01:21:20,685
<i>I'll begin by impounding
the Post's property.</i>

1739
01:21:20,893 --> 01:21:21,893
Is this your desk?

1740
01:21:22,094 --> 01:21:25,188
What are you afraid of, Hildy?
I dare you to move this desk.

1741
01:21:25,398 --> 01:21:27,092
- Go ahead, try it.
- I will.

1742
01:21:27,298 --> 01:21:30,631
I warn you, you move this desk
out of here, I'll put you behind bars.

1743
01:21:30,836 --> 01:21:33,395
- He can do it too.
- I'll see Roosevelt hears about it.

1744
01:21:33,605 --> 01:21:35,005
Tell him. Come on, boys!

1745
01:21:35,207 --> 01:21:37,198
- Confiscate this desk.
- This is your last chance.

1746
01:21:37,409 --> 01:21:39,240
This is a federal offense.

1747
01:21:39,444 --> 01:21:40,877
We'll take a chance.

1748
01:21:41,079 --> 01:21:42,171
All right.

1749
01:21:43,149 --> 01:21:44,707
Open up this door!

1750
01:21:46,085 --> 01:21:49,645
- Mother! I'm glad to see you...
- That's the man that did it. There.

1751
01:21:53,024 --> 01:21:56,016
- What's the idea here?
- She claims she's been kidnapped.

1752
01:21:56,228 --> 01:21:59,220
They dragged me down all the way
down the stairs and...

1753
01:21:59,431 --> 01:22:00,557
Did he do it?

1754
01:22:00,765 --> 01:22:03,462
He was in charge.
He told them to kidnap me.

1755
01:22:03,668 --> 01:22:06,262
Excuse me, madam.
Are you referring to me?

1756
01:22:06,471 --> 01:22:07,529
You know you did.

1757
01:22:07,739 --> 01:22:09,673
What about this? Kidnapping, huh?

1758
01:22:09,875 --> 01:22:13,105
Trying to frame me, huh?
I never saw her before in my life.

1759
01:22:13,311 --> 01:22:14,904
What a thing to say!

1760
01:22:15,113 --> 01:22:17,309
I was here when that girl
jumped out the window.

1761
01:22:17,515 --> 01:22:18,778
Get the mayor over here.

1762
01:22:18,984 --> 01:22:21,612
Look, madam, be honest.
If you were out joyriding...

1763
01:22:21,820 --> 01:22:24,948
...plastered, or got into a scrape,
why don't you admit it instead of...

1764
01:22:25,157 --> 01:22:26,488
...accusing innocent people?

1765
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:29,354
You ruffian! How dare you talk
like that to me!

1766
01:22:29,561 --> 01:22:30,688
He's just crazy, Mother.

1767
01:22:30,895 --> 01:22:33,831
I'll tell more.
I could tell you why they did it.

1768
01:22:34,033 --> 01:22:36,627
They were hiding some
kind of murderer in here...

1769
01:22:36,836 --> 01:22:38,234
Hiding him? In here?

1770
01:22:38,436 --> 01:22:41,132
Madam, you're a cockeyed liar...

1771
01:22:41,340 --> 01:22:43,136
...and you know it!

1772
01:22:44,275 --> 01:22:45,470
- What's that?
- He's in there!

1773
01:22:45,677 --> 01:22:47,372
- Give me the desk.
- What a break!

1774
01:22:47,579 --> 01:22:49,137
- Stand back.
- He might shoot.

1775
01:22:49,347 --> 01:22:50,439
- Guns out.
- He's harmless.

1776
01:22:50,649 --> 01:22:51,911
Don't take any chances.

1777
01:22:52,118 --> 01:22:53,983
He can't hurt anybody,
you've got his gun.

1778
01:22:54,185 --> 01:22:56,244
Go on, you gray-haired old weasel.

1779
01:22:56,454 --> 01:22:57,819
Let me out of here!

1780
01:22:58,224 --> 01:23:00,953
Mother! I was looking
all over for you. What happened?

1781
01:23:01,159 --> 01:23:02,159
Jake, hang on.

1782
01:23:02,360 --> 01:23:03,360
Hildy, call Duffy.

1783
01:23:03,561 --> 01:23:05,189
- No!
- You want to see us scooped?

1784
01:23:05,564 --> 01:23:08,088
- Aim right for the center.
- That's murder.

1785
01:23:08,300 --> 01:23:10,324
Okay, one of you get
on each end of the desk.

1786
01:23:10,536 --> 01:23:11,832
- It's coming up.
- You're covered.

1787
01:23:12,037 --> 01:23:13,230
- In a minute.
- Don't move.

1788
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:14,599
- Any time now.
- I'll count three.

1789
01:23:14,806 --> 01:23:15,806
It's hot.

1790
01:23:15,940 --> 01:23:16,940
Ready?

1791
01:23:16,975 --> 01:23:17,975
Any second now.

1792
01:23:18,109 --> 01:23:20,078
Three. I got you, Williams.

1793
01:23:20,279 --> 01:23:22,247
- Go ahead, shoot me.
- Come out.

1794
01:23:22,448 --> 01:23:25,610
Earl Williams was just captured
in the criminal courts building.

1795
01:23:25,818 --> 01:23:28,615
- On your feet.
- Don't try any funny stuff.

1796
01:23:28,820 --> 01:23:30,185
Williams was unconscious.

1797
01:23:30,389 --> 01:23:31,980
The police overpowered him.

1798
01:23:32,190 --> 01:23:35,354
- He offered no resistance.
- His gun wouldn't work.

1799
01:23:35,895 --> 01:23:38,226
<i>The Post turned Williams
over to the sheriff.</i>

1800
01:23:38,430 --> 01:23:40,193
- Put the cuffs on them.
- More later.

1801
01:23:40,399 --> 01:23:43,663
An anonymous note led to
Williams' capture. Hold on.

1802
01:23:44,569 --> 01:23:47,163
The sheriff's tracing a call
that gave away Williams' hiding place.

1803
01:23:47,372 --> 01:23:49,398
- Where's the old lady?
- She went out.

1804
01:23:49,608 --> 01:23:50,836
Call you back.

1805
01:24:00,653 --> 01:24:03,952
- Give me the warden's office.
- You'll wish you'd never been born.

1806
01:24:04,155 --> 01:24:05,555
Will I?

1807
01:24:05,757 --> 01:24:08,123
- Hello, Fred.
- Well, fine work, Pete.

1808
01:24:08,327 --> 01:24:10,761
- You delivered the goods.
- Looks natural, don't it?

1809
01:24:10,962 --> 01:24:12,953
- Sight for sore eyes.
- Aiding a criminal.

1810
01:24:13,164 --> 01:24:15,689
And a little charge of kidnapping...
What's that?

1811
01:24:15,900 --> 01:24:17,128
But that's the jail.

1812
01:24:17,336 --> 01:24:20,600
Looks like about ten years apiece
for you two birds.

1813
01:24:20,805 --> 01:24:23,639
<i>When you think you've licked the Post,
it's time to get out.</i>

1814
01:24:23,841 --> 01:24:26,503
Whistling in the dark won't help.
You're through.

1815
01:24:26,712 --> 01:24:30,273
Archie Leach said that to me
a week before he cut his throat.

1816
01:24:30,481 --> 01:24:31,481
Is that so?

1817
01:24:31,617 --> 01:24:34,676
We've been in worse jams than this,
haven't we, Hildy?

1818
01:24:34,886 --> 01:24:37,480
<i>You forget the power
that watches over the Post.</i>

1819
01:24:37,689 --> 01:24:40,123
- It's not with you now.
- Says you.

1820
01:24:40,326 --> 01:24:42,317
I've caught him. Yes, Williams.

1821
01:24:42,528 --> 01:24:44,996
Single-handed.
Proceed to the hanging, per schedule.

1822
01:24:45,197 --> 01:24:47,096
You'll be in office exactly
two days more.

1823
01:24:47,298 --> 01:24:49,266
We'll pull your nose
out of that feedbag.

1824
01:24:49,467 --> 01:24:53,904
I tell you what you'll be doing.
Making brooms in the penitentiary.

1825
01:24:54,105 --> 01:24:55,403
Joe? This is Hartwell.

1826
01:24:55,608 --> 01:24:57,199
Come to my office right away.

1827
01:24:57,408 --> 01:25:00,344
I captured a couple of important birds.
Take their confessions.

1828
01:25:00,546 --> 01:25:01,637
Get Liebowitz.

1829
01:25:01,846 --> 01:25:04,110
The lawyers won't help you now.

1830
01:25:04,516 --> 01:25:06,083
<i>You're talking to the Morning Post.</i>

1831
01:25:06,284 --> 01:25:08,310
The power of the press?

1832
01:25:08,787 --> 01:25:11,881
Bigger men than you have found out
what the power of the press is.

1833
01:25:12,091 --> 01:25:13,387
Presidents, kings...

1834
01:25:13,591 --> 01:25:15,855
- Here's the reprieve.
- Get out.

1835
01:25:16,060 --> 01:25:18,756
- You can't bribe me. My wife...
- Get out.

1836
01:25:18,963 --> 01:25:21,796
- No, I won't. Here's the reprieve.
- What?

1837
01:25:22,001 --> 01:25:23,969
I don't want to be a city sealer.

1838
01:25:24,168 --> 01:25:25,693
- Throw him out.
- Out you go.

1839
01:25:25,904 --> 01:25:27,734
Wait.
Who's trying to bribe you?

1840
01:25:27,939 --> 01:25:29,338
- They wouldn't take it.
- Insane!

1841
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:31,532
What did I say? An unseen power.

1842
01:25:31,743 --> 01:25:34,109
What do you mean with a story like that?

1843
01:25:34,313 --> 01:25:35,644
He's an imposter.

1844
01:25:35,847 --> 01:25:38,612
Trying to hang an innocent man
to win an election, eh?

1845
01:25:38,817 --> 01:25:39,817
That's murder.

1846
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:41,819
- I never saw him before.
- Lf I was to...

1847
01:25:42,020 --> 01:25:43,886
- What's your name?
- Pettibone.

1848
01:25:44,088 --> 01:25:46,613
- When did you deliver this first?
- Who'd you talk to?

1849
01:25:46,824 --> 01:25:48,485
- They started to bribe me.
- They?

1850
01:25:48,694 --> 01:25:50,957
- Those. Them.
- It's absurd on the face of it.

1851
01:25:51,162 --> 01:25:52,528
He's talking like a child.

1852
01:25:52,730 --> 01:25:55,063
- Out of the mouths of babes.
- Hi, babe.

1853
01:25:55,266 --> 01:25:56,461
He's insane or drunk.

1854
01:25:56,668 --> 01:26:01,002
If Williams has been reprieved,
I'm tickled to death. Aren't you?

1855
01:26:01,206 --> 01:26:03,037
You'd hang your mother
to be reelected.

1856
01:26:03,242 --> 01:26:05,506
That's a horrible thing to say
about anybody.

1857
01:26:05,711 --> 01:26:07,975
You're marvelous.
Take a look at that.

1858
01:26:08,180 --> 01:26:10,113
- You're an intelligent man.
- Never mind.

1859
01:26:10,315 --> 01:26:12,408
Let's have your story.

1860
01:26:12,618 --> 01:26:15,177
- Nineteen years ago, I married Mrs...
- Skip all that.

1861
01:26:15,386 --> 01:26:18,412
She wasn't Mrs. Pettibone then.
She was one of the...

1862
01:26:18,623 --> 01:26:22,150
This document is authentic.
Williams has been reprieved.

1863
01:26:22,360 --> 01:26:25,659
Our commonwealth has been saved
the necessity of shedding blood.

1864
01:26:25,863 --> 01:26:28,923
<i>Get off the soapbox.
Save that for the Tribune.</i>

1865
01:26:29,134 --> 01:26:30,998
Take those handcuffs off my friends.

1866
01:26:31,203 --> 01:26:33,398
- I'm amazed at you.
- Isn't he awful?

1867
01:26:33,604 --> 01:26:35,970
You don't know how badly I feel.

1868
01:26:36,175 --> 01:26:38,006
No excuse at all for Pete.

1869
01:26:38,210 --> 01:26:40,439
- I was only doing my duty.
- That's all right.

1870
01:26:40,645 --> 01:26:43,274
- What'd you say your name was?
- Pettibone.

1871
01:26:43,481 --> 01:26:45,506
- Here's a picture of my wife.
- Fine-looking woman.

1872
01:26:45,717 --> 01:26:47,618
- You haven't seen her yet.
- She's all right.

1873
01:26:47,819 --> 01:26:50,686
She's good enough for me.
If I was to tell...

1874
01:26:50,889 --> 01:26:54,484
I understand perfectly, and
as long as I am mayor...

1875
01:26:54,693 --> 01:26:56,456
Which ought to be about
Three more hours.

1876
01:26:56,662 --> 01:26:59,391
Enough to get out a special edition
asking for your recall.

1877
01:26:59,597 --> 01:27:03,295
And your arrest. You boys
ought to get about ten years apiece.

1878
01:27:03,502 --> 01:27:07,461
Don't make any hasty decisions.
You might run into a libel suit.

1879
01:27:07,672 --> 01:27:09,140
You'll run into the governor.

1880
01:27:09,440 --> 01:27:12,069
We understand each other perfectly.

1881
01:27:12,344 --> 01:27:13,970
Yes, and so do I.

1882
01:27:14,179 --> 01:27:16,943
So do you what?
And now, Mr. Pettibone...

1883
01:27:17,149 --> 01:27:20,743
...we'll deliver this reprieve
to the warden's office. Come along.

1884
01:27:20,953 --> 01:27:23,921
- Lf I was to tell my wife...
- You won't have to.

1885
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:28,255
<i>Wait till they read
the Morning Post tomorrow.</i>

1886
01:27:28,460 --> 01:27:29,460
Tight squeeze.

1887
01:27:29,560 --> 01:27:31,893
- Give me Duffy.
- That's the worst jam.

1888
01:27:32,096 --> 01:27:33,529
What? Where? Get him.

1889
01:27:33,731 --> 01:27:36,826
Remember stealing Old Lady Haggerty's
stomach off the coroner?

1890
01:27:37,034 --> 01:27:39,332
Anytime you need this guy
he's never there.

1891
01:27:39,537 --> 01:27:41,801
We proved she'd been poisoned,
didn't we?

1892
01:27:42,006 --> 01:27:43,599
We had to hide out for a week.

1893
01:27:43,809 --> 01:27:44,969
Do you remember that?

1894
01:27:45,176 --> 01:27:48,408
The Shoreland Hotel.
That's how we happened to...

1895
01:27:48,613 --> 01:27:50,707
We could have gone
to jail for that too.

1896
01:27:50,916 --> 01:27:53,850
Yes, maybe you're right, Hildy.
It's a bad business.

1897
01:27:54,051 --> 01:27:55,576
You'll be better off.

1898
01:27:55,787 --> 01:27:57,118
You better get going.

1899
01:27:57,322 --> 01:27:59,846
- Where would I go?
- To Bruce, of course.

1900
01:28:00,057 --> 01:28:02,753
- You know he's gone. He took a train.
- Send a wire.

1901
01:28:02,961 --> 01:28:05,828
He'll be waiting at the station
when you get into Albany.

1902
01:28:06,030 --> 01:28:09,659
- Why doesn't he have a phone?
- I don't know. I got us messed up...

1903
01:28:09,868 --> 01:28:13,326
- Get going, Hildy.
- What is that with you?

1904
01:28:13,538 --> 01:28:16,163
Wait a minute.
Can't you understand?

1905
01:28:16,375 --> 01:28:19,935
I'm trying to do something noble.
Get out before I change my mind.

1906
01:28:20,145 --> 01:28:21,475
It's tough enough now.

1907
01:28:21,680 --> 01:28:24,614
- Just a minute.
- Send him a wire. He'll be waiting.

1908
01:28:24,817 --> 01:28:27,649
- Who'll write the story?
- I will. It won't be as good...

1909
01:28:27,853 --> 01:28:30,185
It's my story.
I like to think that it...

1910
01:28:30,389 --> 01:28:33,756
- At last.
- I get it. The same old act, isn't it?

1911
01:28:33,958 --> 01:28:36,484
Try to push me out,
thinking I'll want to stay.

1912
01:28:36,694 --> 01:28:39,356
I know I deserve that.
Wait a minute, Duffy.

1913
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:40,963
This time you're wrong.

1914
01:28:41,166 --> 01:28:44,567
When you walk out that door,
part of me will go right with you.

1915
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:46,828
But a whole new world
will open up for you.

1916
01:28:47,038 --> 01:28:49,837
I made fun of Bruce and Albany.
You know why?

1917
01:28:50,042 --> 01:28:51,372
- Why?
- I was jealous.

1918
01:28:51,577 --> 01:28:55,411
I was sore because he could offer you
the kind of life I can't give you.

1919
01:28:55,613 --> 01:28:56,944
That's what you want, honey.

1920
01:28:57,149 --> 01:28:59,173
I could do the story
and take the train...

1921
01:28:59,384 --> 01:29:01,978
Forget it. Come on. Come on.

1922
01:29:02,186 --> 01:29:03,984
Goodbye, dear, and good luck.

1923
01:29:08,060 --> 01:29:11,324
Duffy, now this is how
it goes so far...

1924
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:13,020
Just a minute.

1925
01:29:14,032 --> 01:29:16,523
Hello. Who? Hildy Johnson?

1926
01:29:16,734 --> 01:29:19,295
- She just left.
- I'm still here. I can take it.

1927
01:29:19,505 --> 01:29:20,904
Hang on a minute.

1928
01:29:23,007 --> 01:29:24,805
Hildy Johnson speaking.

1929
01:29:25,743 --> 01:29:28,076
The Fourth Precinct Police Station?

1930
01:29:28,279 --> 01:29:29,507
Put him on.

1931
01:29:30,414 --> 01:29:32,905
I thought you were
on your way to Albany...

1932
01:29:33,118 --> 01:29:34,118
What for?

1933
01:29:34,252 --> 01:29:36,220
For having counterfeit money.

1934
01:29:36,421 --> 01:29:37,786
Counterfeit money?

1935
01:29:37,989 --> 01:29:39,457
Hold on a minute.

1936
01:29:39,658 --> 01:29:41,216
Where did you get it?

1937
01:29:41,426 --> 01:29:43,121
I gave it to you?

1938
01:29:43,662 --> 01:29:47,462
All right.
I'll try and do something about it.

1939
01:29:58,277 --> 01:29:59,470
Honey.

1940
01:30:00,345 --> 01:30:02,574
Honey, don't cry, please.

1941
01:30:02,780 --> 01:30:06,511
I didn't mean to make you cry.
What's wrong? You never cried before.

1942
01:30:08,052 --> 01:30:11,988
I thought you were really
sending me away with Bruce.

1943
01:30:13,492 --> 01:30:15,823
I didn't know you had him locked up.

1944
01:30:16,427 --> 01:30:19,523
I thought you were
on the level, for once.

1945
01:30:19,731 --> 01:30:23,292
That you were just standing by
and letting me go off with him...

1946
01:30:23,502 --> 01:30:25,595
...and not doing a thing about it.

1947
01:30:25,805 --> 01:30:28,432
Come on, honey. What did you
think I was, a chump?

1948
01:30:28,640 --> 01:30:30,871
I thought you didn't love me.

1949
01:30:31,077 --> 01:30:32,668
What were you thinking with?

1950
01:30:32,878 --> 01:30:34,210
I don't know.

1951
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,911
What are you standing
there gawking for?

1952
01:30:38,117 --> 01:30:40,278
We have to get him out of jail.

1953
01:30:40,485 --> 01:30:42,783
Send Louie down
with some honest money...

1954
01:30:42,988 --> 01:30:44,786
...and send him back to Albany.

1955
01:30:44,990 --> 01:30:46,252
Sure.

1956
01:30:46,893 --> 01:30:50,328
Everything's changed.
We're coming over to the office.

1957
01:30:50,529 --> 01:30:53,020
Don't worry about the story.
Hildy will write it.

1958
01:30:53,231 --> 01:30:55,859
She never intended to quit.
We're getting married.

1959
01:30:56,069 --> 01:30:58,162
Can we go on a honeymoon this time?

1960
01:30:58,371 --> 01:30:59,371
Sure.

1961
01:30:59,505 --> 01:31:02,405
Duffy, you can be managing editor.

1962
01:31:02,609 --> 01:31:05,510
Not permanently.
Just for the two weeks we're away.

1963
01:31:05,712 --> 01:31:07,612
I don't know where.
Where are we going?

1964
01:31:07,814 --> 01:31:09,304
Niagara Falls.

1965
01:31:09,515 --> 01:31:11,744
- Niagara Falls.
- Two whole weeks?

1966
01:31:11,951 --> 01:31:14,748
Sure, you've earned it. What?

1967
01:31:14,953 --> 01:31:18,219
What? A strike? What strike?

1968
01:31:18,423 --> 01:31:19,423
Where?

1969
01:31:19,692 --> 01:31:20,886
Albany?

1970
01:31:21,226 --> 01:31:24,287
- I know it's on the way, but...
- Okay, we'll honeymoon in Albany.

1971
01:31:24,497 --> 01:31:25,963
Okay, Duffy.

1972
01:31:26,698 --> 01:31:29,725
Isn't that a coincidence!
I wonder if Bruce can put us up.

1973
01:31:29,935 --> 01:31:32,268
Say, why don't you carry that
in your hand?
