00:02:14,798 --> 00:02:16,800
- Will you brats keep quiet?

4
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:22,013
How do you expect me to concentrate?

5
00:02:28,437 --> 00:02:31,398
- Well, oliver won't let
me play with my blocks.

6
00:02:34,985 --> 00:02:39,364
- Will you leave stanley
alone and play quietly?

7
00:02:40,449 --> 00:02:43,827
- Certainly, if you must make
a noise, make it quietly.

8
00:02:46,413 --> 00:02:49,082
- Make a noise quietly.

9
00:02:50,584 --> 00:02:55,589
Give me those.

10
00:04:01,696 --> 00:04:02,531
- Ooh!

11
00:04:20,507 --> 00:04:21,716
- Oh!

12
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:33,436
Now listen, if you don't keep quiet,

13
00:04:33,478 --> 00:04:35,146
You'll have to go to bed.

14
00:04:35,188 --> 00:04:37,023
- Yes, we'll have to go to bed.

15
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:40,235
- Not we, the kids.

16
00:04:42,737 --> 00:04:44,489
Now keep quiet.

17
00:04:50,704 --> 00:04:53,498
- Let's play hide and seek.

18
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:56,459
- You're it.
- No, you're it.

19
00:04:56,501 --> 00:04:59,796
- No, you're it.
- No, you're it.

20
00:04:59,838 --> 00:05:03,133
- I don't want to be it.

21
00:05:44,507 --> 00:05:47,636
- That's enough, get to bed.

22
00:05:47,677 --> 00:05:52,390
- Yes, get to bed.

23
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:55,268
- Go ahead.

24
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,021
- You see, if you had been it,

25
00:05:58,063 --> 00:06:00,231
We wouldn't have to go to bed.

26
00:06:18,124 --> 00:06:19,459
- Boys will be boys.

27
00:06:20,335 --> 00:06:21,920
- Blood's thicker than water.

28
00:06:24,464 --> 00:06:27,592
- Blood's thicker than water.

29
00:06:27,634 --> 00:06:31,346
Come on.

30
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:06,756
- Oh.

31
00:07:55,305 --> 00:07:58,349
- Oh!

32
00:07:58,391 --> 00:08:00,935
- Oliver, will you stop throwing things?

33
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:07,776
- Oh, oh!

34
00:08:07,817 --> 00:08:11,321
- If you brats don't get to
bed, i'll break your necks.

35
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,532
- Sh, don't talk to 'em like that.

36
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:19,746
Treat them with kindness,
you'll get more out of them.

37
00:08:21,331 --> 00:08:25,919
Remember the old adage, you
can lead a horse to water,

38
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,004
But a pencil must be led.

39
00:08:31,508 --> 00:08:34,344
- I guess you are right.

40
00:08:34,385 --> 00:08:39,390
Now listen, the first
one undressed and to bed

41
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,478
Gets that nickel.

42
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,026
Goodbye.
- See?

43
00:08:56,282 --> 00:08:58,409
See what a little bit of kindness will do?

44
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:04,082
- You're right, a little
kindness goes a long way.

45
00:10:52,732 --> 00:10:54,150
- Have a marshmallow?

46
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:04,804
- Shoot that ball.

47
00:13:00,651 --> 00:13:02,487
- It's my break.
- It's my break.

48
00:13:02,528 --> 00:13:04,947
- It's my break, you went in the pocket.

49
00:13:46,155 --> 00:13:48,074
- Let's get him.

50
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,897
- Why don't you do something to help me?

51
00:14:44,464 --> 00:14:48,968
Oh.

52
00:17:50,524 --> 00:17:53,444
- Now, who's making all this noise?

53
00:17:54,528 --> 00:17:56,614
- He hit me.
- I did not.

54
00:17:58,699 --> 00:18:03,704
He hit me.

55
00:18:03,913 --> 00:18:06,707
- Why is it, when your mother's home,

56
00:18:06,749 --> 00:18:08,501
You always go to sleep?

57
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:12,004
- Mama always sings us to sleep.

58
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,927
- If i'll sing to you,
will you go to sleep?

59
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:29,730
Now lie down, and i'll sing for you.

60
00:19:45,806 --> 00:19:46,724
- Lay down.

61
00:20:19,882 --> 00:20:24,887
- Will you go to sleep?

62
00:20:25,721 --> 00:20:27,515
- Can i have a drink of water?

63
00:20:30,142 --> 00:20:33,187
- Me too!

64
00:20:33,229 --> 00:20:36,023
- If i give you a drink of
water, will you go to sleep?

65
00:20:41,362 --> 00:20:44,448
Just a moment.

66
00:20:44,490 --> 00:20:49,036
You might spill it.
