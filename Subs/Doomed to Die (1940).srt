1
00:01:33,411 --> 00:01:35,235
Oh, jeez!

2
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:40,774
- Oh, no, no, no! No!
- Shit!

3
00:01:42,453 --> 00:01:44,773
- Back up, goddammit!
- I'm on it, I'm on it!

4
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,512
What happened, Shaun-boy?

5
00:01:54,532 --> 00:01:56,647
Sorry, Bull, it was a pothole.
I didn't see it.

6
00:01:56,667 --> 00:01:58,606
Clean it up, for Chrissake!

7
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:02,886
Come on, move it!

8
00:02:04,775 --> 00:02:06,447
Move!

9
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,494
And lock it this time.

10
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:20,938
Now you drive.

11
00:02:20,958 --> 00:02:22,860
We have to move, Bull!

12
00:02:24,093 --> 00:02:26,375
Let's go!

13
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:53,034
Shit. How much further?

14
00:02:58,161 --> 00:03:00,644
Here. Sawbridge.

15
00:03:00,664 --> 00:03:02,375
We're nearly there.

16
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:06,082
- Look out!
- Shit!

17
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,234
Shit!

18
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,921
Shit!

19
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,946
Shit!

20
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:17,258
Shit!

21
00:03:21,919 --> 00:03:23,897
No, no, no, no, no.

22
00:03:24,287 --> 00:03:26,537
Agh! It's jammed! It's jammed!

23
00:03:26,557 --> 00:03:28,371
- What do we do?
- Just shut up!

24
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,952
Let me think, let me think!

25
00:03:31,194 --> 00:03:33,590
- Christ!
- Just get out!

26
00:03:36,967 --> 00:03:40,125
Oh, shit!

27
00:03:49,413 --> 00:03:50,821
Fuck!

28
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,847
Get 'em out of there.

29
00:04:04,193 --> 00:04:05,876
Talk fast, Dwightie.

30
00:04:05,896 --> 00:04:07,143
What could I do?

31
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:09,513
It was standing in
the middle of the bloody road!

32
00:04:09,533 --> 00:04:10,648
So?

33
00:04:10,668 --> 00:04:13,450
You're supposed to go
through 'em, not around them!

34
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:15,886
I didn't have time to think,
Bull. I just...

35
00:04:15,906 --> 00:04:17,314
I'm sorry.

36
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,392
We can get it
out of there, I swear we can.

37
00:04:21,412 --> 00:04:24,128
No one's gonna find it
at least. It's safe for now.

38
00:04:24,148 --> 00:04:27,196
Oh, yeah, it's safe. Hmm?

39
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:30,501
It's safe...
for all fucking eternity!

40
00:04:30,521 --> 00:04:32,069
I will get it out of there, Bull.

41
00:04:32,089 --> 00:04:34,371
I swear on my mother's life, I will.

42
00:04:34,625 --> 00:04:37,173
Okay.

43
00:04:37,193 --> 00:04:39,172
It's alright, Dwightie. Alright?

44
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,525
I'll do it myself, yeah?

45
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:09,473
What's the plan?

46
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:11,977
I'm working on it.

47
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,327
Cranes.

48
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,447
Don't they have cranes
for this type of thing?

49
00:05:16,467 --> 00:05:19,660
No cranes.
We'd draw too much attention.

50
00:05:22,305 --> 00:05:24,521
Now, what we need is divers.

51
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:26,023
- Divers?
- Yeah.

52
00:05:26,043 --> 00:05:29,793
You know, with the big helmets
and the rubber togs?

53
00:05:29,813 --> 00:05:33,236
- Find me some fuckin' divers.
- Got it, Bull.

54
00:06:13,157 --> 00:06:15,539
- How'd you go?
- No good.

55
00:06:15,559 --> 00:06:17,708
That valve's gonna need
a bigger spring.

56
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:21,178
Dammit. I was hoping
third time would be a charm.

57
00:06:21,198 --> 00:06:22,846
We've never been that lucky.

58
00:06:22,866 --> 00:06:26,898
No. But if anyone can do it,
Jimmy, it's you.

59
00:06:33,877 --> 00:06:35,209
Where's Ernie?

60
00:06:38,248 --> 00:06:40,226
Is he still not awake?

61
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:45,202
He's gonna sleep the whole day away.

62
00:06:45,222 --> 00:06:46,970
Was he on the sauce again?

63
00:06:46,990 --> 00:06:48,511
All night.

64
00:06:49,325 --> 00:06:51,008
What was it this time?

65
00:06:51,028 --> 00:06:52,892
He wouldn't say.

66
00:07:06,977 --> 00:07:09,827
Oh! Ohh...

67
00:07:09,847 --> 00:07:12,014
Oh...

68
00:07:12,482 --> 00:07:14,330
What time is it?

69
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:16,329
Almost midday.

70
00:07:16,987 --> 00:07:19,368
Shit!

71
00:07:19,388 --> 00:07:20,871
By the way,

72
00:07:20,891 --> 00:07:22,539
that new hose you ordered
finally arrived.

73
00:07:22,559 --> 00:07:24,942
I paid with a check. Is that alright?

74
00:07:24,962 --> 00:07:27,311
Will be. Till it bounces.

75
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,545
Ooh, and Jimmy will have the valve

76
00:07:28,565 --> 00:07:30,314
on helmet two repaired today.

77
00:07:30,334 --> 00:07:32,844
Which means we're all set
and ready to go.

78
00:07:33,003 --> 00:07:35,134
Tell him there's no rush.

79
00:07:35,806 --> 00:07:37,621
We didn't get the bridge contract.

80
00:07:37,641 --> 00:07:40,424
Why not? I thought it was settled.

81
00:07:40,444 --> 00:07:42,259
They changed their minds.

82
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,760
They went with the Alberts.

83
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:46,263
But we can do it better,
and at a better price...

84
00:07:46,283 --> 00:07:47,664
Not anymore.

85
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:49,587
Not without our own boat.

86
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:51,468
But how will we afford one

87
00:07:51,488 --> 00:07:54,911
if we keep losing
all of these big contracts?

88
00:07:56,727 --> 00:07:59,443
Yeah, it means I won't be able
to pay ya for last month.

89
00:07:59,463 --> 00:08:01,288
You or Jimmy.

90
00:08:01,932 --> 00:08:03,447
I'm sorry, kiddo.

91
00:08:03,467 --> 00:08:06,319
Everything's just gone
to hell in a hand basket.

92
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,357
Hey...

93
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:15,926
We'll survive.

94
00:08:15,946 --> 00:08:18,095
We always do.

95
00:08:18,115 --> 00:08:19,294
Somehow.

96
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,932
And, look, if the Alberts are
busy for the next three months,

97
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:23,834
that leave everything for us, right?

98
00:08:23,854 --> 00:08:25,035
Sure.

99
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:26,970
If there's anything else.

100
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:29,006
Always the optimist.

101
00:08:29,026 --> 00:08:31,408
Right. Come on. Get dressed.

102
00:08:31,428 --> 00:08:33,010
Go and help Jimmy with that valve.

103
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,545
I-I've got to weld
that damn winch on the truck.

104
00:08:35,565 --> 00:08:37,314
- It's come loose again.
- Leave that to me.

105
00:08:37,334 --> 00:08:38,682
I'm not the one trying to sober up.

106
00:08:38,702 --> 00:08:41,098
Eh, uh... Just be careful.

107
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:14,484
Oh!

108
00:09:14,504 --> 00:09:17,220
Hello. How can I help?

109
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:19,257
Who is boss here?

110
00:09:19,576 --> 00:09:21,358
Oh, well, um... that's Ernie.

111
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,860
But, um...
he's a little busy right now.

112
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,163
Is there anything I can help with?

113
00:09:26,183 --> 00:09:29,568
No. We need to speak to him.

114
00:09:29,853 --> 00:09:30,934
Right.

115
00:09:30,954 --> 00:09:33,921
Alright, well, give me a minute.

116
00:09:37,627 --> 00:09:39,910
Ernie. There's two gentlemen outside.

117
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:42,554
They want to speak
to the man in charge.

118
00:09:49,639 --> 00:09:50,754
You the boss?

119
00:09:50,774 --> 00:09:53,424
Yes. Ernie Morgan. Owner/operator.

120
00:09:53,444 --> 00:09:55,192
- Dylan Maddock.
- Mr Maddock.

121
00:09:55,212 --> 00:09:58,161
I hear that you're the bloke
to see about a special job.

122
00:09:58,181 --> 00:09:59,741
Of course!

123
00:10:01,385 --> 00:10:03,324
It's just this way.

124
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:09,822
Take a seat.

125
00:10:10,227 --> 00:10:11,608
Excuse the mess.

126
00:10:11,628 --> 00:10:14,329
You caught us at a good time.

127
00:10:19,002 --> 00:10:21,437
So you were in the service, I see.

128
00:10:22,706 --> 00:10:25,222
Royal Navy during the Great War.

129
00:10:25,242 --> 00:10:27,090
Four years. You?

130
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:28,725
'41 to '42.

131
00:10:28,745 --> 00:10:30,594
Infantry. We were in North Africa.

132
00:10:30,614 --> 00:10:32,397
Oh! Heard that was a helluva fight.

133
00:10:32,417 --> 00:10:33,897
That it was.

134
00:10:33,917 --> 00:10:36,633
So you, uh,
you been a diver ever since?

135
00:10:36,653 --> 00:10:38,535
Yes. Worked in pearl
and abalone farms.

136
00:10:38,555 --> 00:10:40,003
In the north, mostly.

137
00:10:40,023 --> 00:10:42,639
Ah, there wouldn't be much call
for that round here, surely.

138
00:10:42,659 --> 00:10:44,341
Oh, we do whatever's needed.

139
00:10:44,361 --> 00:10:46,643
Underwater salvage, repairs,

140
00:10:46,663 --> 00:10:48,578
maintenance, piping.

141
00:10:48,598 --> 00:10:50,515
Your crew... Are they good?

142
00:10:50,535 --> 00:10:51,915
They're the best.

143
00:10:51,935 --> 00:10:55,386
I run a three-man team,
unless the job requires more.

144
00:10:55,406 --> 00:10:58,155
So what's this, uh, special job?

145
00:10:58,175 --> 00:10:59,524
It's like this.

146
00:10:59,544 --> 00:11:03,193
Friend of mine,
stupid fucking idiot he is,

147
00:11:03,213 --> 00:11:05,796
he drove into a river
about 40 miles north of here.

148
00:11:05,816 --> 00:11:06,963
Oh.

149
00:11:06,983 --> 00:11:10,100
Now, inside that car were
some things that belong to me.

150
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:13,270
The job's simple. Find the car
and bring them back.

151
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:14,571
What's in the car?

152
00:11:14,591 --> 00:11:15,739
Confidential.

153
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:18,443
Truth is, Ernie, in my line of work,

154
00:11:18,463 --> 00:11:20,210
I don't like a lot of questions.

155
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:22,018
What's your line of work?

156
00:11:27,472 --> 00:11:29,144
So, what's this gonna cost me?

157
00:11:29,973 --> 00:11:31,955
Ten quid a day, plus expenses.

158
00:11:31,975 --> 00:11:35,859
But not knowing what we're
salvaging... could be more.

159
00:11:35,879 --> 00:11:39,379
We pay two fifty, up front.

160
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:43,700
Plus another two fifty
when the job's done.

161
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:45,969
But I want no questions, Ernie.

162
00:11:45,989 --> 00:11:48,371
Not from you or your men.

163
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:50,827
And this job stays off the books.

164
00:11:51,061 --> 00:11:53,677
That's the deal. Plain and simple.

165
00:11:53,697 --> 00:11:55,599
Take it or leave it.

166
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:13,464
What was that all about?

167
00:12:13,484 --> 00:12:16,641
That is our next meal ticket, kiddos.

168
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:18,436
<I>Well, I don't like it.</I>

169
00:12:18,456 --> 00:12:21,726
We should at least know
who it is we're working for.

170
00:12:22,025 --> 00:12:24,374
This is our first paid job
in over four months.

171
00:12:24,394 --> 00:12:25,675
You should be happy as Larry.

172
00:12:25,695 --> 00:12:28,912
They said no questions,
and that's fine by me.

173
00:12:28,932 --> 00:12:30,947
Yes, but that's what bothers me.

174
00:12:30,967 --> 00:12:34,162
What are they hiding?
Who are we even working for?

175
00:12:34,971 --> 00:12:36,454
Listen, kiddo.

176
00:12:36,474 --> 00:12:39,557
If we don't take this job,
we won't last the year.

177
00:12:39,577 --> 00:12:41,626
I'll have to sell up
to pay off my debts.

178
00:12:41,646 --> 00:12:43,193
I don't want to send Jimmy home

179
00:12:43,213 --> 00:12:45,162
with nothing but
the clothes on his back.

180
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,030
And what about you?

181
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:49,332
You think Rod Albert's
gonna hire you?

182
00:12:49,352 --> 00:12:52,436
He doesn't believe women should
even be in the workforce.

183
00:12:52,456 --> 00:12:53,863
Hmm?

184
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:57,036
Ah.

185
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:00,744
- What's this?
- That...

186
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,446
is what they're paying us.

187
00:13:02,466 --> 00:13:04,247
- Two fifty.
- Really?

188
00:13:04,267 --> 00:13:08,185
Plus an extra two fifty
when the job's done.

189
00:13:09,507 --> 00:13:11,556
But this means we can buy a boat.

190
00:13:11,576 --> 00:13:12,989
We can buy a boat!

191
00:13:13,009 --> 00:13:14,891
- Yes!
- Oh! Okay, Clara...

192
00:13:14,911 --> 00:13:17,662
- Okay, okay, okay...
- I'm sorry. I can't believe it.

193
00:13:17,682 --> 00:13:18,995
Well, believe it.

194
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:21,632
That's enough for a boat,
a motorized air pump,

195
00:13:21,652 --> 00:13:23,967
a dive platform,
the whole kit and kaboodle.

196
00:13:23,987 --> 00:13:25,769
We can finally do that deep-sea dive

197
00:13:25,789 --> 00:13:27,405
you've been pestering me about.

198
00:13:27,425 --> 00:13:29,507
- Are you serious?
- It's a promise.

199
00:13:29,527 --> 00:13:31,107
But only if you stop

200
00:13:31,127 --> 00:13:33,714
giving me the third degree
about this job.

201
00:13:34,965 --> 00:13:36,295
Deal.

202
00:13:37,033 --> 00:13:39,383
<I>Now</I> I'm happy as Larry.

203
00:13:39,403 --> 00:13:41,685
Good... Good!

204
00:14:20,745 --> 00:14:22,379
Hello again.

205
00:14:24,515 --> 00:14:26,162
Follow me.

206
00:14:26,182 --> 00:14:27,362
Okay.

207
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:12,677
You got here fast. I'm impressed.

208
00:15:12,697 --> 00:15:14,344
Come and meet my crew.

209
00:15:14,364 --> 00:15:16,747
- You've meet Clara.
- Hello again.

210
00:15:16,767 --> 00:15:18,631
And this is Jimmy.

211
00:15:25,208 --> 00:15:27,891
Hey, you said you had
a three-man team.

212
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:30,026
Alright? Not a skirt and a darkie.

213
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:31,429
I'm paying you good money, Ernie.

214
00:15:31,449 --> 00:15:34,111
- For that, I expect the best.
- They are the best.

215
00:15:34,418 --> 00:15:37,535
What's he best at, huh?
Chuckin' spears?

216
00:15:37,555 --> 00:15:40,970
Listen, Jimmy's one of
the best divers in the country.

217
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:42,172
You're lucky to have him.

218
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:44,131
Is that so?

219
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:52,849
So, what makes you the best?

220
00:15:52,869 --> 00:15:55,761
- Jimmy's been on...
- Let the native speak.

221
00:15:59,376 --> 00:16:04,511
Been diving since I was a kid.
Been under water half my life.

222
00:16:08,686 --> 00:16:10,266
And what about you, sweetheart?

223
00:16:10,286 --> 00:16:12,068
It's a bit early for nicknames,
isn't it?

224
00:16:12,088 --> 00:16:14,752
Now, now.
I'm just trying to be pleasant.

225
00:16:15,526 --> 00:16:17,307
Well, I've been
a licensed diver for a year.

226
00:16:17,327 --> 00:16:19,175
Been with the Sea Dogs
for six months.

227
00:16:19,195 --> 00:16:21,645
During the war, I was in the
Australian Women's Land Army.

228
00:16:21,665 --> 00:16:23,643
Doing what, huh? Feeding the chooks?

229
00:16:24,402 --> 00:16:25,850
I worked the shipyards, factories.

230
00:16:25,870 --> 00:16:27,016
I was cleaning engines.

231
00:16:27,036 --> 00:16:28,686
Before that,
I was a research assistant

232
00:16:28,706 --> 00:16:29,919
at the University of Sydney.

233
00:16:29,939 --> 00:16:32,055
Wow. You're a real smart cookie.

234
00:16:32,075 --> 00:16:34,891
Mmm. Smarter than some.

235
00:16:36,580 --> 00:16:38,027
Well, well, boys...

236
00:16:38,047 --> 00:16:40,964
Despite appearances,
looks like we have Captain Nemo

237
00:16:40,984 --> 00:16:43,501
and his finest on the job.

238
00:16:43,521 --> 00:16:45,955
Let's see what they can do.

239
00:17:00,003 --> 00:17:02,386
Okay. Let's get you two in the water.

240
00:17:02,406 --> 00:17:04,497
Well, don't you want me up top?

241
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,991
I don't want to go fumbling
around in that muck.

242
00:17:08,011 --> 00:17:09,693
I figured you would.

243
00:17:09,713 --> 00:17:11,429
Well, you figured right.

244
00:17:11,449 --> 00:17:13,273
Great. Let's go.

245
00:17:38,274 --> 00:17:40,858
When should we tell them
what's in the boxes?

246
00:17:40,878 --> 00:17:43,092
They'll figure it out soon enough.

247
00:17:43,112 --> 00:17:45,161
Besides...

248
00:17:45,181 --> 00:17:47,959
once it's done, they're dead anyway.

249
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:49,751
Mm.

250
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:19,471
Here we go, gentlemen.

251
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:47,216
Hearing me, kiddos?

252
00:19:47,236 --> 00:19:48,986
<I>Roger. Loud and clear.</I>

253
00:19:49,006 --> 00:19:50,374
<I>Hearing you, boss.</I>

254
00:19:53,844 --> 00:19:55,593
Visibility is poor.

255
00:19:55,613 --> 00:19:58,395
Can't see more than
a foot or two ahead.

256
00:19:58,415 --> 00:20:00,598
<I>Wait till it gets deep.</I>

257
00:20:00,618 --> 00:20:03,166
<I>Working in a river
is like working in a cave.</I>

258
00:20:05,723 --> 00:20:08,706
There's lots of fallen trees.

259
00:20:08,726 --> 00:20:10,774
Don't snag your line, Jimmy.

260
00:20:10,794 --> 00:20:12,543
Yep. Copy that.

261
00:20:14,965 --> 00:20:17,180
Coming up to a hundred feet.

262
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,550
You must be getting close.
What's your depth?

263
00:20:19,570 --> 00:20:22,987
<I>My guess is 15, 18 feet at most?</I>

264
00:20:23,007 --> 00:20:24,718
Roger that.

265
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:37,633
Whoa. Did you feel that?

266
00:20:38,789 --> 00:20:40,269
What was it?

267
00:20:40,289 --> 00:20:42,610
Couldn't tell, but pretty big.

268
00:21:19,863 --> 00:21:21,745
Found it!

269
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:23,947
Jimmy, over here.

270
00:21:23,967 --> 00:21:25,181
Found the van.

271
00:21:25,201 --> 00:21:26,762
Excellent.

272
00:21:44,788 --> 00:21:47,871
Ernie, it's landed on its side.

273
00:21:47,891 --> 00:21:50,607
There's no way we can
winch it out without a crane.

274
00:21:50,627 --> 00:21:54,203
Look, we don't care about
the van - only what's inside.

275
00:21:54,998 --> 00:21:56,847
Clara, can you open it up?

276
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,415
<I>No problem.</I>

277
00:21:58,435 --> 00:22:01,022
Tying off the guideline now.

278
00:22:12,082 --> 00:22:13,530
Guideline attached.

279
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:16,099
<I>Copy that. Good job.</I>

280
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:31,448
Clara, look at this.

281
00:22:31,468 --> 00:22:33,083
What have they got in there?

282
00:22:33,103 --> 00:22:34,451
A lot of boxes.

283
00:22:34,471 --> 00:22:36,153
Boxes of what?

284
00:22:36,173 --> 00:22:38,189
Let's find out.

285
00:22:40,110 --> 00:22:41,425
Locked.

286
00:22:41,445 --> 00:22:43,494
Maybe the key's
still be in the ignition.

287
00:22:43,514 --> 00:22:45,229
Do you reckon you could reach it?

288
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:47,074
Maybe.

289
00:23:00,030 --> 00:23:02,161
The keys are here.

290
00:23:06,737 --> 00:23:09,052
There are labels on the boxes.

291
00:23:09,072 --> 00:23:11,165
I can't quite make them out.

292
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,828
Clara, what happened?

293
00:23:17,848 --> 00:23:20,264
<I>What's goin' on down there?</I>

294
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:22,032
Something knocked me over.

295
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,400
<I>What was it?</I>

296
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:25,322
I didn't see.
It just came out of nowhere.

297
00:23:47,811 --> 00:23:49,066
Clara!

298
00:23:50,881 --> 00:23:53,329
Clara, talk to me! Can you hear me?

299
00:23:53,349 --> 00:23:55,214
Jesus!

300
00:23:58,722 --> 00:24:00,890
Shit! Her air line's come out!

301
00:24:04,061 --> 00:24:06,039
Can you hear me? Clara!

302
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:12,516
Christ! Jimmy, you gotta find
her before she runs out of air!

303
00:24:12,536 --> 00:24:14,514
I'm tracking her.

304
00:24:28,952 --> 00:24:30,534
<I>Jimmy! What's going on?</I>

305
00:24:30,554 --> 00:24:31,923
Clara!

306
00:24:32,356 --> 00:24:33,637
Ernie, I found her!

307
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:36,707
- <I>Good! Okay.</I>
- Clara! Clara!

308
00:24:36,727 --> 00:24:39,543
She's passed out.
I'm gonna do a blow up.

309
00:24:39,563 --> 00:24:41,745
- <I>Roger that.</I>
- Get ready to pull us in.

310
00:24:41,765 --> 00:24:44,998
- Hey... crank the wheel!
- Go on.

311
00:24:48,005 --> 00:24:49,679
Here we come.

312
00:24:50,774 --> 00:24:52,638
Faster, come on!

313
00:24:56,179 --> 00:24:59,488
Clara, hold on. Hold on.

314
00:25:09,159 --> 00:25:10,641
Oh, kiddo.

315
00:25:10,661 --> 00:25:11,742
God...

316
00:25:11,762 --> 00:25:13,777
Oh, God.

317
00:25:13,797 --> 00:25:14,878
Hey. Hey.

318
00:25:14,898 --> 00:25:16,179
Okay, kiddo.

319
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:17,814
Okay. Alright.

320
00:25:17,834 --> 00:25:19,016
Hey, hey!

321
00:25:19,036 --> 00:25:21,685
Come on. Come on, wake up.
You can do it.

322
00:25:21,705 --> 00:25:23,987
That's it. Slow. Slow.

323
00:25:24,007 --> 00:25:26,391
Oh, that's it. That's it.

324
00:25:26,411 --> 00:25:27,824
Shhh. That's it.

325
00:25:27,844 --> 00:25:29,927
Look there.

326
00:25:29,947 --> 00:25:32,262
Okay, okay...

327
00:25:32,282 --> 00:25:34,260
Are you okay, kid?

328
00:25:38,255 --> 00:25:40,803
- Wamba?
- Wamba.

329
00:25:41,391 --> 00:25:42,706
You're kidding me.

330
00:25:42,726 --> 00:25:45,108
A fucking shark in the river?

331
00:25:45,128 --> 00:25:46,443
It's a bull shark.

332
00:25:46,463 --> 00:25:48,812
It lives in fresh and salt water.

333
00:25:48,832 --> 00:25:50,547
But what the hell's it doing up here?

334
00:25:50,567 --> 00:25:52,049
It's 50 miles from the coast.

335
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,251
Bull sharks swim up rivers.
Hundreds of miles.

336
00:25:54,271 --> 00:25:55,986
Have babies, then swim back out.

337
00:25:56,006 --> 00:25:58,055
The ones that remain upriver
are usually juveniles.

338
00:25:58,075 --> 00:26:01,925
But, judging by its size,
this one's an adult female.

339
00:26:01,945 --> 00:26:03,660
The females are always bigger.

340
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,662
Alright, so how big
are we talking here?

341
00:26:05,682 --> 00:26:08,465
Ah, 12, 15 feet. Nose to tail.

342
00:26:08,485 --> 00:26:10,968
Big deal. That's not so big.

343
00:26:10,988 --> 00:26:12,736
Well, most bull sharks
are only eight feet.

344
00:26:12,756 --> 00:26:14,604
They're also the most aggressive.

345
00:26:14,624 --> 00:26:16,831
Oh, well, that's just great.

346
00:26:17,060 --> 00:26:20,377
Isn't this what you divers
deal with every other week?

347
00:26:20,397 --> 00:26:22,379
What, you're telling me
you shit yourself

348
00:26:22,399 --> 00:26:25,148
every time a shark turns up, huh?

349
00:26:25,168 --> 00:26:26,451
Get a load of this, guys.

350
00:26:26,471 --> 00:26:28,719
Professional divers.
Scared of a fuckin' fish!

351
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,921
A bull shark is not just any fish.

352
00:26:30,941 --> 00:26:32,656
Certainly not one
that's fearless enough

353
00:26:32,676 --> 00:26:33,890
to attack a diver.

354
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,360
I don't care
if it's Moby Dick in there.

355
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:39,042
You got a job to do.
Get back to work.

356
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:47,037
My team's not going back in
until that shark's dealt with.

357
00:26:47,057 --> 00:26:48,772
So you want me to catch it for you?

358
00:26:48,792 --> 00:26:50,466
I don't care who catches it.

359
00:26:51,028 --> 00:26:55,326
But until someone does...
we don't dive.

360
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,450
Jesus Christ.

361
00:26:59,236 --> 00:27:03,020
You want this thing caught -
it comes out of your purse.

362
00:27:03,040 --> 00:27:04,621
Saddle up, boys.

363
00:27:04,641 --> 00:27:07,304
Let's go find ourselves a fisherman.

364
00:27:07,577 --> 00:27:09,898
One with a set of balls.

365
00:27:11,516 --> 00:27:13,722
I know where to go.

366
00:27:38,241 --> 00:27:39,524
Hey.

367
00:27:39,544 --> 00:27:41,024
You did good today.

368
00:27:41,044 --> 00:27:44,161
You saved her life. I'm proud of you.

369
00:27:44,181 --> 00:27:46,830
By the way, did you see
what was inside the van?

370
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:49,166
Couldn't tell. Just wooden boxes.

371
00:27:49,186 --> 00:27:50,367
What do you think it is?

372
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:51,902
I don't know.

373
00:27:51,922 --> 00:27:55,231
But next dive, find out, okay?

374
00:27:56,026 --> 00:28:00,477
Oh, Jimmy! Keep it quiet.

375
00:28:06,471 --> 00:28:08,085
Knock, knock?

376
00:28:08,105 --> 00:28:09,360
Come in.

377
00:28:10,941 --> 00:28:13,337
Ah, feeling better, kiddo?

378
00:28:13,643 --> 00:28:15,826
Yeah, I'm getting there.

379
00:28:15,846 --> 00:28:18,595
Well, first sign of any
sore joints or headaches,

380
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,593
you let me know, right?

381
00:28:21,351 --> 00:28:23,139
Yes. No, I, um...

382
00:28:23,687 --> 00:28:26,616
- I think I'm okay. Yep.
- Mm.

383
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:28,208
Um...

384
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:30,961
Okay.

385
00:28:35,966 --> 00:28:39,769
You wanna stay up top
from here on, that's fine.

386
00:28:40,637 --> 00:28:43,375
I feel like I let you down.

387
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,423
Let you all down.

388
00:28:45,443 --> 00:28:47,657
Hey. You didn't let anyone down.

389
00:28:47,677 --> 00:28:49,126
Could've been any one of us.

390
00:28:49,146 --> 00:28:53,177
You're alive. Jimmy's alive.
That's all that matters.

391
00:28:56,686 --> 00:28:59,425
I reckon you could use a drink.

392
00:29:00,891 --> 00:29:02,983
I reckon we all could.

393
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:25,996
Any luck?

394
00:29:26,016 --> 00:29:28,603
We found a local fisherman in town.

395
00:29:28,852 --> 00:29:31,325
He'll be here first thing tomorrow.

396
00:29:33,123 --> 00:29:36,541
Claims to be an expert
catching sharks in this river.

397
00:29:36,561 --> 00:29:38,499
Lucky for you, he works cheap.

398
00:29:39,129 --> 00:29:40,498
That's great.

399
00:29:41,398 --> 00:29:44,136
Helluva first day, hey, lads?

400
00:29:44,468 --> 00:29:46,446
So, how's the drowned rat?

401
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:50,086
I'm alright. Thanks for asking.

402
00:29:50,106 --> 00:29:51,054
You're welcome.

403
00:29:51,074 --> 00:29:52,756
Are you boys staying here tonight?

404
00:29:52,776 --> 00:29:55,725
Hell no. Got a hotel back in town.

405
00:29:55,745 --> 00:29:57,461
It's a shit-hole, but...

406
00:29:57,481 --> 00:29:59,996
better than being out here
with the flies and these bugs.

407
00:30:00,016 --> 00:30:02,223
Oh, not afraid of a few bugs,
are you?

408
00:30:05,556 --> 00:30:07,381
Not a drinker, Jimmy-boy?

409
00:30:07,958 --> 00:30:10,707
Oh, that's right - it's not
legal for you lot, is it?

410
00:30:10,727 --> 00:30:11,841
That's a shame.

411
00:30:11,861 --> 00:30:13,243
Why is it illegal?

412
00:30:13,263 --> 00:30:16,610
Because the blacks like
getting on the piss too much.

413
00:30:16,766 --> 00:30:18,898
Not as much as you whities.

414
00:30:24,074 --> 00:30:25,290
Yeah.

415
00:30:29,746 --> 00:30:32,523
Now, he does make
a good point there, Ernie.

416
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:35,298
That he does.

417
00:30:35,318 --> 00:30:38,469
Man enough to fight and die
for his country they say,

418
00:30:38,489 --> 00:30:40,737
but not man enough to buy a beer.

419
00:30:40,757 --> 00:30:42,305
He was in the service?

420
00:30:42,325 --> 00:30:45,330
Yeah, fought
the Japanese. New Guinea.

421
00:30:46,363 --> 00:30:47,619
Ah...

422
00:30:48,432 --> 00:30:49,953
Well, well, well.

423
00:31:05,650 --> 00:31:07,665
Have you ever been
attacked by a shark?

424
00:31:07,685 --> 00:31:09,567
Oh, yeah. Plenty of times.

425
00:31:09,587 --> 00:31:11,067
Mostly little ones.

426
00:31:11,087 --> 00:31:13,537
They come over,
trying to take a bite.

427
00:31:13,557 --> 00:31:15,420
Is that where your scar came from?

428
00:31:15,859 --> 00:31:19,282
No. This was from the war.

429
00:31:19,329 --> 00:31:22,713
But my uncle was swimming
one day and lost an arm.

430
00:31:22,733 --> 00:31:25,282
From here, down... Gone.

431
00:31:25,302 --> 00:31:26,710
Big, big wamba.

432
00:31:27,103 --> 00:31:30,421
My grandfather was
a great hunter of wamba.

433
00:31:30,441 --> 00:31:32,423
I get my tribal name from him.

434
00:31:32,443 --> 00:31:33,823
Barriakada.

435
00:31:33,843 --> 00:31:35,626
Barri-akad-a?

436
00:31:35,646 --> 00:31:37,360
- Barriakada.
- Barri...

437
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,130
He crossed all over my country
with his long spear.

438
00:31:40,150 --> 00:31:42,899
And he cross every river, hunting,

439
00:31:42,919 --> 00:31:45,302
but wamba, it's hard to catch.

440
00:31:45,322 --> 00:31:47,571
But if we catch him,
it's good eating.

441
00:31:47,591 --> 00:31:50,481
That's if he doesn't eat you first.

442
00:31:50,894 --> 00:31:52,809
Very lucky she let you go.

443
00:31:52,829 --> 00:31:54,911
Very lucky you found me.

444
00:31:54,931 --> 00:31:57,380
Trick is,
get straight back in the water.

445
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,836
Mmm. Straight back
on the horse, right?

446
00:32:01,037 --> 00:32:03,129
That's good advice.

447
00:32:07,110 --> 00:32:11,029
Jeez, your boss - he sure can
put 'em away, can't he?

448
00:32:12,982 --> 00:32:15,599
Unfortunately, yes.

449
00:32:15,619 --> 00:32:17,300
I'll deal with him.

450
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,460
Thank you.

451
00:32:23,193 --> 00:32:24,908
It's the local lang...
Do you want some?

452
00:32:24,928 --> 00:32:26,183
Yeah, good.

453
00:32:30,468 --> 00:32:31,761
Yes, why not?

454
00:32:33,637 --> 00:32:35,118
<I>- Come on.
- Hey!</I>

455
00:32:35,138 --> 00:32:36,754
<I>- That's enough.
- Huh?</I>

456
00:32:36,774 --> 00:32:38,422
I think you've had enough. Come on...

457
00:32:38,442 --> 00:32:41,024
Where the hell'd your
boss find that kid anyway?

458
00:32:41,044 --> 00:32:43,159
Ernie was working on the pearl
farms a few years ago,

459
00:32:43,179 --> 00:32:44,861
when his hose got disconnected.

460
00:32:44,881 --> 00:32:46,296
It was Jimmy that found him

461
00:32:46,316 --> 00:32:47,931
lying unconscious on the seabed.

462
00:32:47,951 --> 00:32:49,366
Saved his life.

463
00:32:49,386 --> 00:32:50,908
What about you?

464
00:32:51,154 --> 00:32:53,069
How does a pretty little skirt
get herself

465
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:54,772
into professional diving?

466
00:32:54,792 --> 00:32:56,578
Same way the boys do.

467
00:32:57,127 --> 00:32:59,275
Don't seem like much fun,

468
00:32:59,295 --> 00:33:01,945
freezing your arse off
in those rubber togs.

469
00:33:01,965 --> 00:33:04,914
I daresay my idea of fun
differs greatly from yours.

470
00:33:04,934 --> 00:33:06,617
So why do it?

471
00:33:06,637 --> 00:33:08,284
The ocean.

472
00:33:08,304 --> 00:33:11,020
It's the last frontier on Earth.

473
00:33:11,040 --> 00:33:13,391
So few people get to see it.

474
00:33:13,411 --> 00:33:16,694
You know, I was fortunate that
Ernie gave me the opportunity.

475
00:33:16,714 --> 00:33:18,538
Nobody else would.

476
00:33:18,849 --> 00:33:20,484
He your boyfriend?

477
00:33:22,218 --> 00:33:25,034
He's my boss.

478
00:33:25,054 --> 00:33:27,909
Hey, just making conversation.

479
00:33:28,659 --> 00:33:29,953
Mm.

480
00:33:30,561 --> 00:33:32,510
If you want to know details
about my life,

481
00:33:32,530 --> 00:33:34,812
why don't you tell me
something about yours?

482
00:33:34,832 --> 00:33:36,913
Like what?

483
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:40,950
Like... what business
are you in, exactly?

484
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,986
Men's grooming.

485
00:33:43,006 --> 00:33:45,479
And those boxes, they're filled with?

486
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,572
Grooming products.

487
00:33:48,412 --> 00:33:49,781
Right.

488
00:33:53,249 --> 00:33:56,749
We've got an early start. Goodnight.

489
00:34:10,333 --> 00:34:11,515
Oh...

490
00:34:11,535 --> 00:34:12,583
- Ernie?
- Mmm.

491
00:34:12,603 --> 00:34:14,785
I'm telling you
there is something wrong here.

492
00:34:14,805 --> 00:34:16,119
I don't trust him.

493
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:18,021
Same. He scares the shit outta me.

494
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:19,255
Exactly.

495
00:34:19,275 --> 00:34:21,157
Look, we don't know
what's in those boxes,

496
00:34:21,177 --> 00:34:22,292
but it can't be good.

497
00:34:22,312 --> 00:34:23,928
Let's just pack up and go. Tonight.

498
00:34:23,948 --> 00:34:25,228
We'll give them their money back.

499
00:34:25,248 --> 00:34:27,063
No! We finish the job.

500
00:34:27,083 --> 00:34:29,132
Ernie. There will be other jobs.

501
00:34:29,152 --> 00:34:30,835
We can manage without this one.

502
00:34:30,855 --> 00:34:32,947
There are no other jobs!

503
00:34:34,458 --> 00:34:37,307
We're not leaving.
That's the end of it.

504
00:34:37,327 --> 00:34:40,210
Leave me alone.

505
00:34:40,230 --> 00:34:41,409
Right.

506
00:35:13,597 --> 00:35:16,373
- Morning.
- Morning.

507
00:35:19,335 --> 00:35:21,617
Ernie.

508
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:24,688
Good morning.

509
00:35:24,708 --> 00:35:26,189
Sergeant.

510
00:35:26,209 --> 00:35:27,770
Hey.

511
00:35:29,312 --> 00:35:31,976
Well, that's some interesting
equipment you've got there.

512
00:35:33,417 --> 00:35:34,297
Yes.

513
00:35:34,317 --> 00:35:36,232
Uh, we're helping these gentlemen

514
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:38,301
recover a car from the river.

515
00:35:38,321 --> 00:35:42,619
Oh. I had no report on that.
Was anyone hurt?

516
00:35:42,993 --> 00:35:45,085
Y... you'll have to talk to them.

517
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:51,180
So... why didn't you
report the accident?

518
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:52,716
I didn't know I had to.

519
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:54,250
Was anyone else involved?

520
00:35:54,270 --> 00:35:57,521
Nope. It was just me.
But I got out in time.

521
00:35:57,541 --> 00:35:59,063
Luck of the Irish.

522
00:36:01,545 --> 00:36:02,877
Quite.

523
00:36:03,647 --> 00:36:06,296
Well, if you're thinking of
venturing into the river

524
00:36:06,316 --> 00:36:08,064
you ought to be careful.

525
00:36:08,084 --> 00:36:09,567
There are sharks in there.

526
00:36:09,587 --> 00:36:13,303
Yes, we know. We had a nasty
brush with one yesterday.

527
00:36:13,323 --> 00:36:16,774
We're waiting on
a shark catcher. Bob Drummond.

528
00:36:16,794 --> 00:36:19,843
Oh. I know Bob. He's a good man.

529
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:21,445
Well, he'll sort you out.

530
00:36:21,465 --> 00:36:23,146
Thanks for dropping by, officer.

531
00:36:23,166 --> 00:36:24,613
Good luck.

532
00:36:28,806 --> 00:36:29,985
Yep.

533
00:36:33,477 --> 00:36:34,656
Ma'am.

534
00:36:45,188 --> 00:36:47,470
Oi! He's here.

535
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:59,115
"Out of the boat," they say...

536
00:36:59,135 --> 00:37:01,000
He can't be serious.

537
00:37:06,877 --> 00:37:09,920
Hey, young fella... here you go.

538
00:37:10,781 --> 00:37:12,763
Ah, good morning, gentlemen!

539
00:37:12,783 --> 00:37:14,130
Bob.

540
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:15,558
Big fella.

541
00:37:16,386 --> 00:37:17,901
So...

542
00:37:17,921 --> 00:37:19,870
who wants to go fishing, then, eh?

543
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:21,739
We'll leave that to the expert.

544
00:37:21,759 --> 00:37:24,108
But you bring this baby
back by lunch,

545
00:37:24,128 --> 00:37:26,175
there'll be a fifty quid bonus.

546
00:37:26,195 --> 00:37:30,179
Mmm. You got yourself a deal there.

547
00:37:30,199 --> 00:37:31,448
Righto.

548
00:37:31,468 --> 00:37:32,883
Right, so,
I guess you all heard about

549
00:37:32,903 --> 00:37:35,719
the Great White caught
off Bondi a few months ago?

550
00:37:35,739 --> 00:37:37,621
It was all in the papers.

551
00:37:37,641 --> 00:37:38,756
That was me.

552
00:37:38,776 --> 00:37:40,824
Right, I caught more sharks
than I can remember.

553
00:37:40,844 --> 00:37:42,459
That's not saying much, but...

554
00:37:42,479 --> 00:37:45,696
All along this stretch
of the river here. Righto?

555
00:37:45,716 --> 00:37:48,264
This was the biggest
bull shark I've ever seen.

556
00:37:48,284 --> 00:37:50,299
Female. They're always bigger.

557
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:52,703
She could be pregnant. Might
be why she's so aggressive.

558
00:37:52,723 --> 00:37:54,303
Yep. More than likely.

559
00:37:54,323 --> 00:37:57,007
And your, uh,
little diving expedition here

560
00:37:57,027 --> 00:37:59,308
is in her neck of the woods,
and she don't like it none.

561
00:37:59,328 --> 00:38:01,177
What are the fuckin' odds?

562
00:38:01,197 --> 00:38:02,513
Don't fret.

563
00:38:02,533 --> 00:38:04,882
If she's still down there,
I'll catch her.

564
00:38:04,902 --> 00:38:06,249
Alright?

565
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:09,453
Now, I need two volunteers.
Who's coming with me?

566
00:38:09,473 --> 00:38:12,623
Ah-ah! Sorry, missy. Bad luck
to have a woman on board.

567
00:38:12,643 --> 00:38:14,558
If she's as big as you say she is,

568
00:38:14,578 --> 00:38:16,794
we need all the muscle
we can get, don't we?

569
00:38:16,814 --> 00:38:18,696
And not you, brawny -
you fart, you'll tip us!

570
00:38:18,716 --> 00:38:20,263
- Who else?
- I'll go.

571
00:38:20,283 --> 00:38:21,665
Ah, good lad. Come on.

572
00:38:21,685 --> 00:38:23,667
Bet you've caught a fish or two
in your life, have ya?

573
00:38:23,687 --> 00:38:25,469
Good. Ya know how
to work a motor, son?

574
00:38:25,489 --> 00:38:27,571
- Yep.
- Jump on in.

575
00:38:27,591 --> 00:38:30,520
Sure beats a bark canoe,
doesn't it, eh?

576
00:38:31,327 --> 00:38:33,043
- Righto, who else?
- Shaun-boy.

577
00:38:33,063 --> 00:38:35,231
You just volunteered.

578
00:38:37,735 --> 00:38:40,055
Are you kidding me?
I'm not gettin' in that boat.

579
00:38:40,537 --> 00:38:41,785
What did you just say?

580
00:38:41,805 --> 00:38:44,450
Look, I'm not gettin' in that
boat. Make one of them do it.

581
00:38:44,808 --> 00:38:46,056
Two choices.

582
00:38:46,076 --> 00:38:47,758
You get your ass in that boat,

583
00:38:47,778 --> 00:38:50,023
or my boot in your ass.

584
00:38:52,483 --> 00:38:53,662
Alright.

585
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:57,401
Are we good to go?

586
00:38:57,421 --> 00:38:59,670
Righto, this here's for the big ones.

587
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:01,572
They don't like getting caught none.

588
00:39:01,592 --> 00:39:03,774
A little bit of incentive,
alright? Show her who's boss.

589
00:39:03,794 --> 00:39:07,077
You do know that bullets slow
down when they hit the water?

590
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,913
Well, I'll shoot her when
she's out of the water, then,

591
00:39:09,933 --> 00:39:11,415
won't I, missy?

592
00:39:11,435 --> 00:39:13,517
Righto, can ya handle that, son?

593
00:39:13,537 --> 00:39:15,419
Is the Pope Catholic?

594
00:39:15,439 --> 00:39:17,387
Got a helluva kick.
Watch her, alright?

595
00:39:17,407 --> 00:39:19,556
Righto, good to go. Wish us luck!

596
00:39:19,576 --> 00:39:21,058
Mate, uh, give us a shove out,
will ya?

597
00:39:21,078 --> 00:39:22,226
Sure.

598
00:39:22,246 --> 00:39:23,957
Alright, jump up front.

599
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:26,088
Righto, Jingo!

600
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,165
No, Jingo.

601
00:39:28,185 --> 00:39:30,353
Don't embarrass me now, Jingo,
come on.

602
00:39:30,788 --> 00:39:33,837
You know what to do.
There's people watching here...

603
00:39:33,857 --> 00:39:35,226
Let's go.

604
00:39:36,927 --> 00:39:38,175
There we go!

605
00:39:38,195 --> 00:39:40,819
Let's go fishing! You beauty!

606
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,169
Beautiful day...

607
00:39:57,881 --> 00:40:00,831
I like the feel
of this spot here, boys.

608
00:40:00,851 --> 00:40:01,899
Cutting engine.

609
00:40:01,919 --> 00:40:04,268
Chuck us that rod first.

610
00:40:04,288 --> 00:40:06,190
Just throw that anchor out.

611
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:08,304
Careful.

612
00:40:08,324 --> 00:40:10,874
Yes. This is the spot.

613
00:40:13,163 --> 00:40:14,913
Righto.

614
00:40:15,933 --> 00:40:18,747
Just throw a little bit
of this beautiful stuff out.

615
00:40:19,403 --> 00:40:21,852
There's nothing more
these sharks love

616
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:24,221
than the smell of blood in the water.

617
00:40:24,241 --> 00:40:26,256
Drives the buggers crazy.

618
00:40:26,276 --> 00:40:28,324
Whips 'em into a frenzy.

619
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:31,195
Sometimes they even start
eating 'emselves.

620
00:40:31,215 --> 00:40:33,345
It's a helluva sight, I tell ya!

621
00:40:34,251 --> 00:40:35,658
Yep.

622
00:40:40,389 --> 00:40:43,207
Alright, here we go.
Let's get in the water.

623
00:40:43,227 --> 00:40:44,901
Ahh.

624
00:40:48,364 --> 00:40:50,343
Right on, righto.

625
00:40:52,069 --> 00:40:53,817
So, what now?

626
00:40:53,837 --> 00:40:56,086
Well, now...

627
00:40:56,106 --> 00:40:57,628
we wait.

628
00:41:00,277 --> 00:41:01,723
Right.

629
00:41:31,275 --> 00:41:33,253
Here we go, boys.

630
00:41:39,283 --> 00:41:41,755
Come on, take a big bite.

631
00:41:42,319 --> 00:41:45,068
Okay...

632
00:41:45,088 --> 00:41:47,170
Gimme a hand!

633
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:48,522
Gimme a hand!

634
00:41:58,969 --> 00:42:00,338
No!

635
00:42:03,206 --> 00:42:04,995
- Oh, shit.
- Bloody hell.

636
00:42:05,676 --> 00:42:07,882
Give me that tacklebox, Jimmy.

637
00:42:08,211 --> 00:42:10,661
- What happened?
- Ah, she got lucky, is all.

638
00:42:10,681 --> 00:42:12,796
So did you. You almost went in.

639
00:42:12,816 --> 00:42:15,440
- Yeah.
- Thanks, mate.

640
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:18,140
Boys, she's comin' back!

641
00:42:19,256 --> 00:42:20,570
If you can plug her, plug her.

642
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,239
Plug it!

643
00:42:22,259 --> 00:42:24,241
Ah, shit...

644
00:42:24,261 --> 00:42:25,935
Here!

645
00:42:27,397 --> 00:42:29,246
Ernie?

646
00:42:29,266 --> 00:42:31,168
Are you seeing this?

647
00:42:43,213 --> 00:42:44,849
Keep it.

648
00:42:46,016 --> 00:42:47,690
Christ...

649
00:42:55,492 --> 00:42:57,140
- Take a shot!
- Shoot it!

650
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,949
Come on!

651
00:43:01,164 --> 00:43:02,579
Gimme the fuckin' harpoon.

652
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:04,463
- What?
- Gimme the harpoon!

653
00:43:05,068 --> 00:43:06,384
Come on!

654
00:43:06,404 --> 00:43:07,583
Good.

655
00:43:10,173 --> 00:43:11,999
Where are you?

656
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:22,163
Yes. Come on.

657
00:43:32,562 --> 00:43:35,545
I can't get up!

658
00:43:35,565 --> 00:43:37,924
Move around and hold it steady.

659
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:45,224
Hurry, up!

660
00:43:46,943 --> 00:43:50,062
- Get in the boat!
- Goddammit! Agh!

661
00:44:04,094 --> 00:44:05,768
Come on!

662
00:44:16,139 --> 00:44:17,700
No... No!

663
00:44:20,210 --> 00:44:21,884
Jesus Christ.

664
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:28,399
We are in deep bloody shit!

665
00:44:28,419 --> 00:44:31,651
Get us outta here! Come on! Come on!

666
00:44:45,536 --> 00:44:46,676
Jimmy!

667
00:44:48,004 --> 00:44:50,488
- Are you alright? You okay?
- I'm okay.

668
00:44:50,508 --> 00:44:52,371
- Yeah?
- I'm okay.

669
00:44:54,744 --> 00:44:57,327
Ah, I see you've been
swimming again, Shaun-boy.

670
00:44:57,347 --> 00:45:00,465
I guess old Bob wasn't
all he was cracked up to be.

671
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:02,966
You think this is funny?
A man is dead!

672
00:45:02,986 --> 00:45:05,192
What the hell is wrong with you?

673
00:45:06,256 --> 00:45:08,473
Where do you think
you're goin', Ernie?

674
00:45:08,493 --> 00:45:10,207
Gotta report it to the police.

675
00:45:10,227 --> 00:45:11,975
You ain't reportin' nothing.

676
00:45:11,995 --> 00:45:13,210
Why not?

677
00:45:13,230 --> 00:45:15,345
- You got a job to do.
- And what exactly <I>is</I> our job?

678
00:45:15,365 --> 00:45:18,523
Put a fuckin' muzzle on her,
Ernie, before I do.

679
00:45:19,504 --> 00:45:21,518
This job's over.

680
00:45:23,974 --> 00:45:26,522
Clara, Jimmy,
let's pack up the truck.

681
00:45:27,377 --> 00:45:30,306
- Ernie!
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh!

682
00:45:32,782 --> 00:45:35,788
Nothing is over until I say it is.

683
00:45:35,886 --> 00:45:38,635
I will personally feed you,
the skirt and the darkie

684
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,170
to that fucking fish.

685
00:45:40,190 --> 00:45:42,440
One juicy chunk at a time. Got that?

686
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:43,773
What's in the boxes?

687
00:45:43,793 --> 00:45:46,952
What was the deal, Ernie?
No questions.

688
00:45:47,330 --> 00:45:51,059
I swear to God, no one keeps
their fuckin' word anymore.

689
00:45:53,770 --> 00:45:55,520
Shark or no shark,

690
00:45:55,540 --> 00:45:57,020
you're going back in that river.

691
00:45:57,040 --> 00:46:01,224
You tell us what's in there,
or we take a look ourselves.

692
00:46:01,244 --> 00:46:02,527
Gold bullion.

693
00:46:02,547 --> 00:46:05,095
And before you ask, yeah, I stole it.

694
00:46:05,115 --> 00:46:08,652
You realize how long
that's gonna take to bring up?

695
00:46:09,753 --> 00:46:11,464
That's your problem, Ernie.

696
00:46:12,122 --> 00:46:14,671
That's why I pay you the big bucks.

697
00:46:14,691 --> 00:46:17,772
You'll figure it out. And fast.

698
00:46:19,630 --> 00:46:22,712
And what happens then?
To us. When it's done.

699
00:46:22,732 --> 00:46:25,348
Well, you get paid and you go home.

700
00:46:25,368 --> 00:46:27,422
Everyone's happy.

701
00:46:52,896 --> 00:46:57,347
You speak English,
or you don't speak.

702
00:47:11,515 --> 00:47:14,197
The hell is this? A raft?

703
00:47:14,217 --> 00:47:15,499
It's a sled.

704
00:47:15,519 --> 00:47:18,835
We walk it out, load it up,
then winch it back to shore.

705
00:47:18,855 --> 00:47:20,136
Provided it doesn't snag.

706
00:47:20,156 --> 00:47:22,138
There's fallen trees
everywhere down there.

707
00:47:22,158 --> 00:47:23,873
We'll make a path best we can.

708
00:47:23,893 --> 00:47:25,775
We should also set up
a decoy down river.

709
00:47:25,795 --> 00:47:27,077
Some meat on a rope and hook.

710
00:47:27,097 --> 00:47:28,878
Might keep the shark
distracted long enough

711
00:47:28,898 --> 00:47:30,814
to give us a chance.

712
00:47:30,834 --> 00:47:33,049
See? Just like I said...

713
00:47:33,069 --> 00:47:34,751
People are never more creative

714
00:47:34,771 --> 00:47:37,167
than when they got
a gun to their head.

715
00:47:39,876 --> 00:47:41,779
So, what are we waiting for?

716
00:47:49,853 --> 00:47:51,368
Right, watch closely.

717
00:47:51,388 --> 00:47:53,709
You see it being taken,
that's our cue.

718
00:48:09,172 --> 00:48:10,854
Ernie?

719
00:48:10,874 --> 00:48:12,690
Let me go back down there.

720
00:48:12,710 --> 00:48:14,492
You haven't been in a suit in months.

721
00:48:14,512 --> 00:48:16,489
You're not going in that river.

722
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:20,957
Besides, you're good on the
wheels. You're better than me.

723
00:48:24,054 --> 00:48:27,935
I got us into this mess,
when I should've walked away.

724
00:48:28,858 --> 00:48:30,799
This one's on me.

725
00:48:33,431 --> 00:48:36,777
Let's get it done,
and then we can go home.

726
00:48:37,735 --> 00:48:38,815
Right.

727
00:48:38,835 --> 00:48:40,350
Okay.

728
00:48:40,370 --> 00:48:41,664
Ready?

729
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:07,654
It's taken the bait!

730
00:49:09,933 --> 00:49:11,749
<I>Ernie, the shark's taken the decoy.</I>

731
00:49:11,769 --> 00:49:13,216
<I>You should be all clear.</I>

732
00:49:13,236 --> 00:49:16,659
Thanks, Clara. Jimmy, stay alert.

733
00:49:17,907 --> 00:49:19,886
You feed out the lines.

734
00:49:36,993 --> 00:49:38,576
Christ...

735
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:41,790
I can't see a damn thing down here!

736
00:49:42,533 --> 00:49:43,980
<I>Watch out for snags.</I>

737
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,510
<I>You should be at the van
in a couple of minutes.</I>

738
00:50:13,229 --> 00:50:15,278
Ernie, how's it going down there?

739
00:50:15,298 --> 00:50:17,113
<I>Decoy won't last forever.</I>

740
00:50:17,133 --> 00:50:19,112
Going as fast as we can.

741
00:50:24,842 --> 00:50:27,458
There. I see it - right ahead.

742
00:50:27,478 --> 00:50:30,939
Okay, Jimmy, let's get it opened up.

743
00:50:50,967 --> 00:50:52,516
Door's open.

744
00:50:52,536 --> 00:50:54,247
We're in business.

745
00:50:58,509 --> 00:50:59,824
Bloody hell.

746
00:50:59,844 --> 00:51:01,157
<I>What is it?</I>

747
00:51:01,177 --> 00:51:03,394
There must be
two dozen boxes down here.

748
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:05,830
There's no way we can
take this in in one haul.

749
00:51:05,850 --> 00:51:07,765
<I>We're gonna need two trips.</I>

750
00:51:07,785 --> 00:51:09,500
You'll be lucky to survive one.

751
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,302
<I>No choice - the winch
can only handle so much.</I>

752
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:15,214
Come on. No time to lose.

753
00:51:15,426 --> 00:51:17,106
I'll start loading, Jimmy.

754
00:51:17,126 --> 00:51:20,626
- You get the work lamp up.
- Copy that.

755
00:51:31,742 --> 00:51:33,122
It's done.

756
00:51:33,142 --> 00:51:34,932
Good work.

757
00:51:35,211 --> 00:51:38,940
Now jump in and start passing
those boxes through.

758
00:51:39,583 --> 00:51:41,446
I'm on it.

759
00:52:13,349 --> 00:52:17,040
Better tell them to watch it,
the decoy is gone.

760
00:52:17,988 --> 00:52:20,471
Ernie, Jim, decoy's gone.

761
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:22,740
<I>Be careful down there.
The shark could be anywhere.</I>

762
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:24,408
We're almost done anyway.

763
00:52:24,428 --> 00:52:26,633
The sled can't take much more.

764
00:52:26,997 --> 00:52:28,975
Okay, Jimmy, last one.

765
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:31,784
Here you go.

766
00:52:34,203 --> 00:52:36,410
Help me strap 'em on.

767
00:52:43,414 --> 00:52:45,061
I can handle the rest.

768
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:47,598
You keep an eye out
for that shark. Okay?

769
00:52:47,618 --> 00:52:48,799
On it.

770
00:52:48,819 --> 00:52:51,234
Clara, start the winch.

771
00:52:51,254 --> 00:52:52,436
<I>Let's see if she'll take it.</I>

772
00:52:52,456 --> 00:52:55,347
Roger that. Retract the winch - now!

773
00:53:02,165 --> 00:53:03,763
It's jammed!

774
00:53:04,735 --> 00:53:06,016
No good - it's too heavy.

775
00:53:06,036 --> 00:53:08,431
Roger that. We'll lighten the load.

776
00:53:13,410 --> 00:53:15,291
<I>Ernie, how's it going down there?</I>

777
00:53:15,311 --> 00:53:16,986
Almost done.

778
00:53:19,115 --> 00:53:20,523
Boss?

779
00:53:20,851 --> 00:53:22,409
Oh, shit.

780
00:53:25,689 --> 00:53:27,781
Ernie, I think she's back.

781
00:53:29,258 --> 00:53:30,674
Try now.

782
00:53:30,694 --> 00:53:32,329
Try it again.

783
00:53:35,198 --> 00:53:36,780
It's working.

784
00:53:36,800 --> 00:53:39,650
Slow, but it's on its way back.

785
00:53:39,670 --> 00:53:41,915
<I>Roger that.</I>

786
00:53:46,877 --> 00:53:48,056
Ernie!

787
00:53:49,245 --> 00:53:50,394
It's onto us, alright.

788
00:53:50,414 --> 00:53:51,996
<I>Stay in the van.</I>

789
00:53:52,016 --> 00:53:54,374
<I>Once we've got the sled
back up, we'll haul you in.</I>

790
00:53:54,652 --> 00:53:57,200
Roger that.

791
00:53:57,988 --> 00:53:59,546
That was close.

792
00:54:20,110 --> 00:54:22,925
It's snagged on something.
It's not moving.

793
00:54:23,147 --> 00:54:25,315
Ernie, it's snagged.

794
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:28,532
Come on, Jimmy. Let's go.

795
00:54:28,552 --> 00:54:30,467
What about the shark?

796
00:54:30,487 --> 00:54:32,808
We'll have to take our chances.

797
00:54:37,393 --> 00:54:39,599
Stay close to me, Jimmy.

798
00:54:53,276 --> 00:54:55,659
Hey, Clara, we found it.

799
00:54:55,679 --> 00:54:56,627
<I>Great.</I>

800
00:54:56,647 --> 00:54:58,495
- Shit.
<I>- What?</I>

801
00:54:58,515 --> 00:55:00,097
It's jammed against a log.

802
00:55:00,117 --> 00:55:01,297
<I>Oh, no.</I>

803
00:55:01,317 --> 00:55:04,068
Alright, you take that side.

804
00:55:04,088 --> 00:55:05,531
Come on.

805
00:55:06,023 --> 00:55:08,115
Put your shoulder into it.

806
00:55:08,926 --> 00:55:10,105
Come on.

807
00:55:10,961 --> 00:55:12,576
Go.

808
00:55:12,596 --> 00:55:13,736
Push.

809
00:55:18,001 --> 00:55:19,983
It's too heavy.

810
00:55:20,003 --> 00:55:23,198
Jimmy... let's try over here.

811
00:55:30,848 --> 00:55:32,963
Give me some slack on the cable.

812
00:55:32,983 --> 00:55:34,541
Back off the winch!

813
00:55:38,956 --> 00:55:40,437
Christ!

814
00:55:40,457 --> 00:55:42,139
It's too damn heavy.

815
00:55:42,159 --> 00:55:46,275
Clara, when I say, start that winch.

816
00:55:46,295 --> 00:55:47,478
<I>Okay.</I>

817
00:55:47,498 --> 00:55:49,378
When that winch starts, Jimmy,

818
00:55:49,398 --> 00:55:51,915
push the sled out
and around that tree.

819
00:55:51,935 --> 00:55:53,532
Hit it, Clara!

820
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:03,879
It's free! It's on its way!

821
00:56:04,481 --> 00:56:06,763
<I>Yes! It's working!</I>

822
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,133
Stand by, we're coming back.

823
00:56:09,153 --> 00:56:10,788
<I>Roger that.</I>

824
00:56:23,366 --> 00:56:25,015
- <I>Ernie?</I>
- Christ!

825
00:56:25,035 --> 00:56:26,517
- <I>Ernie?</I>
- Ernie!

826
00:56:26,537 --> 00:56:28,051
<I>Jimmy, tell me
what's going on down there.</I>

827
00:56:28,071 --> 00:56:30,754
Clara, I'm gonna cut
his weights. You haul him in.

828
00:56:30,774 --> 00:56:32,942
Roger that.

829
00:56:33,410 --> 00:56:37,861
I'm walkin' back. Hold onto
this, you might need it.

830
00:56:37,881 --> 00:56:39,099
Haul him in, quickly!

831
00:56:40,751 --> 00:56:43,338
Now! Haul him in!

832
00:56:43,854 --> 00:56:45,564
Chrissake... Haul him in.

833
00:56:47,791 --> 00:56:50,568
Hold on, Ernie. Hold on.

834
00:56:59,169 --> 00:57:02,060
Pull it faster! Pull!

835
00:57:05,776 --> 00:57:06,723
Oh, my God!

836
00:57:06,743 --> 00:57:09,254
Ernie, it's heading straight for you!

837
00:57:10,447 --> 00:57:13,376
Pull faster! Pull!

838
00:57:16,086 --> 00:57:17,568
No!

839
00:57:29,365 --> 00:57:32,295
Clara! What's goin' on?

840
00:57:48,952 --> 00:57:50,436
Come on.

841
00:58:00,130 --> 00:58:02,603
One down, one to go.

842
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,321
No, Ernie.

843
00:58:11,341 --> 00:58:12,422
No...

844
00:58:12,442 --> 00:58:14,291
No, no, no, no, no, no, no...

845
00:58:14,311 --> 00:58:15,792
- Ernie...
- Clara...

846
00:58:15,812 --> 00:58:18,128
Hold still, Ernie. We're gonna
get you out of here.

847
00:58:18,148 --> 00:58:19,529
We're gonna get you out of here.

848
00:58:19,549 --> 00:58:22,266
We have to stop the bleeding.

849
00:58:22,286 --> 00:58:24,101
Ernie, we have to get you
out of this suit.

850
00:58:24,121 --> 00:58:25,718
We have to get you out of here.

851
00:58:27,357 --> 00:58:28,538
We have to cut it off.

852
00:58:28,558 --> 00:58:29,890
Clara...

853
00:58:30,560 --> 00:58:33,143
You got to... get out of here...

854
00:58:33,163 --> 00:58:35,812
Ernie, we are not going anywhere.

855
00:58:35,832 --> 00:58:36,947
Run. Run...

856
00:58:36,967 --> 00:58:39,449
Ernie, no, just please, just...
Just hang on.

857
00:58:39,469 --> 00:58:40,784
Just hang on.

858
00:58:40,804 --> 00:58:44,721
We have to get him
to a hospital! Please!

859
00:58:44,741 --> 00:58:45,996
Please!

860
00:58:46,977 --> 00:58:48,955
You bastards!

861
00:58:55,352 --> 00:58:56,433
- Ernie?
- No, no, no...

862
00:58:56,453 --> 00:58:57,935
Ernie?

863
00:58:57,955 --> 00:58:59,515
Ernie!

864
00:58:59,823 --> 00:59:01,805
Ernie, please, please, please.

865
00:59:01,825 --> 00:59:03,640
Just hang on, just hang on, please.

866
00:59:03,660 --> 00:59:06,543
Please, please... Oh, God...

867
00:59:06,563 --> 00:59:08,879
Oh, God! Oh, God!

868
00:59:08,899 --> 00:59:10,231
No...

869
00:59:12,069 --> 00:59:14,313
No!

870
00:59:22,279 --> 00:59:23,419
Jimmy.

871
00:59:31,121 --> 00:59:33,175
Look out!

872
00:59:37,462 --> 00:59:39,343
You want to kill us, boy?

873
00:59:39,363 --> 00:59:41,144
Let's see you try, huh?

874
00:59:41,164 --> 00:59:42,779
Jimmy. No.

875
00:59:42,799 --> 00:59:45,500
- Put it down.
- No, no. Let him have a go.

876
00:59:46,036 --> 00:59:48,356
I'll make it fair for you.

877
00:59:51,975 --> 00:59:55,225
Come on, boy.
What are you waiting for, huh?

878
00:59:55,245 --> 00:59:56,793
What are you waiting for? Come on.

879
00:59:56,813 --> 00:59:59,196
Come on, Jimmy.
Let's see what you're made of!

880
00:59:59,216 --> 01:00:00,431
- Jimmy... No.
- Huh?

881
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:02,433
Come on, boy, come on!

882
01:00:02,453 --> 01:00:05,952
Do your worst! Come on!

883
01:00:12,129 --> 01:00:15,209
Fucking black bastard!

884
01:00:15,932 --> 01:00:17,264
No!

885
01:00:18,135 --> 01:00:19,182
You kill him,

886
01:00:19,202 --> 01:00:21,184
there's no getting back
the rest of your gold.

887
01:00:21,204 --> 01:00:22,552
I still have you.

888
01:00:22,572 --> 01:00:25,388
Are you gonna man the pumps?
You gonna suit me up?

889
01:00:39,856 --> 01:00:41,910
That was a nice shot, Jimmy.

890
01:00:44,127 --> 01:00:45,345
Stop!

891
01:00:46,963 --> 01:00:48,278
Stop!

892
01:00:48,298 --> 01:00:49,646
Stop.

893
01:00:49,666 --> 01:00:52,215
Now, we're still ten boxes short.

894
01:00:52,235 --> 01:00:53,650
So, tomorrow,

895
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:56,820
you and your boyfriend are
gonna go and get 'em for me.

896
01:00:56,840 --> 01:00:58,019
Okay?

897
01:00:59,976 --> 01:01:01,158
Jimmy?

898
01:01:01,178 --> 01:01:02,318
Jimmy...

899
01:01:26,403 --> 01:01:28,228
Jimmy.

900
01:02:31,735 --> 01:02:34,055
Come on. Get up.

901
01:02:39,544 --> 01:02:41,658
Ow!

902
01:02:41,678 --> 01:02:43,238
Shut up.

903
01:02:51,321 --> 01:02:52,669
Morning.

904
01:02:52,689 --> 01:02:54,553
Big day ahead.

905
01:02:55,459 --> 01:02:57,441
So, who's going swimming?

906
01:02:57,461 --> 01:02:58,576
I will.

907
01:02:58,596 --> 01:03:00,243
No. I'll go.

908
01:03:00,263 --> 01:03:01,845
No.

909
01:03:01,865 --> 01:03:04,080
I think little missy here
should have the honours.

910
01:03:04,100 --> 01:03:06,382
See if she's got what it takes.

911
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:09,819
Come on. Now's your one big chance.

912
01:03:09,839 --> 01:03:12,578
Make old Ernie proud.

913
01:03:17,247 --> 01:03:18,396
Go and get his body.

914
01:03:18,416 --> 01:03:21,532
It'll make a good decoy.
Keep the big fish occupied.

915
01:03:21,552 --> 01:03:24,175
You touch him, I'll bloody kill you.

916
01:03:25,255 --> 01:03:27,638
Ah, suit yourself, mate.

917
01:03:27,658 --> 01:03:29,750
It's your girlfriend in there.

918
01:03:36,634 --> 01:03:39,257
You're going to kill me now?

919
01:04:10,133 --> 01:04:12,782
The rest of the boxes
should all fit on the sled.

920
01:04:12,802 --> 01:04:14,685
Just make sure
you lash them on tight.

921
01:04:14,705 --> 01:04:16,263
Got it.

922
01:04:18,442 --> 01:04:22,777
Today you must become
stronger than the wamba.

923
01:04:23,447 --> 01:04:25,577
Stronger than the wamba.

924
01:04:28,452 --> 01:04:31,167
She's going in there,
she needs the knife.

925
01:04:31,187 --> 01:04:34,763
Shaun-boy, get her the knife.

926
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:42,879
Now, you're gonna stay down there

927
01:04:42,899 --> 01:04:45,449
until every one of those boxes
is accounted for.

928
01:04:45,469 --> 01:04:48,918
The faster you get it done,
the sooner you get to go home.

929
01:04:48,938 --> 01:04:52,757
Will you, though? Let us go home?

930
01:04:52,777 --> 01:04:54,793
That's the deal.

931
01:04:56,980 --> 01:04:59,262
You try anything stupid,

932
01:04:59,282 --> 01:05:01,432
I will blow the darkie's
head off, cut your air

933
01:05:01,452 --> 01:05:03,900
and leave you down there for
the shark and all her babies.

934
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:05,594
You got that?

935
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:10,294
That a girl.

936
01:05:51,769 --> 01:05:53,216
How you doing, Clara?

937
01:05:53,236 --> 01:05:55,404
<I>No sign of her yet.</I>

938
01:06:20,731 --> 01:06:22,633
Okay, I'm here.

939
01:06:23,366 --> 01:06:24,648
<I>Copy that.</I>

940
01:06:24,668 --> 01:06:26,379
<I>Be careful.</I>

941
01:06:42,887 --> 01:06:44,968
Right, that's all of them.

942
01:06:44,988 --> 01:06:47,337
Ten boxes and they're strapped down.

943
01:06:47,357 --> 01:06:49,906
- Start that winch, Jimmy.
<I>- Roger that.</I>

944
01:06:54,498 --> 01:06:56,361
It's on its way.

945
01:07:03,441 --> 01:07:06,055
Shit. She knows I'm here.

946
01:07:06,075 --> 01:07:07,357
<I>It's okay.</I>

947
01:07:07,377 --> 01:07:10,648
<I>Find somewhere to hide
until she loses interest.</I>

948
01:07:13,751 --> 01:07:15,699
<I>Do you copy, Clara?</I>

949
01:07:15,719 --> 01:07:16,901
Clara!

950
01:07:16,921 --> 01:07:18,669
Yes, I copy that.

951
01:07:18,689 --> 01:07:20,361
I'll hide.

952
01:07:28,231 --> 01:07:29,914
<I>Clara, are you okay?</I>

953
01:07:29,934 --> 01:07:32,939
Yes. Yes, I'm inside the van.

954
01:07:33,771 --> 01:07:36,219
I'll wait for her to lose interest.

955
01:07:36,239 --> 01:07:37,987
<I>Good idea. Stay put.</I>

956
01:07:38,007 --> 01:07:39,606
Okay.

957
01:07:57,126 --> 01:07:58,572
It's working.

958
01:07:59,095 --> 01:08:00,808
<I>Okay, good.</I>

959
01:08:17,448 --> 01:08:20,300
<I>Clara!</I>

960
01:08:21,819 --> 01:08:23,797
<I>Talk to me, Clara!</I>

961
01:08:25,990 --> 01:08:27,358
<I>Clara!</I>

962
01:08:28,124 --> 01:08:30,065
<I>Clara, are you safe?</I>

963
01:08:30,528 --> 01:08:33,944
I'm okay. She's trapped inside.

964
01:08:33,964 --> 01:08:35,646
I'm gonna try and jam the door.

965
01:08:35,666 --> 01:08:37,376
<I>Roger that.</I>

966
01:08:42,673 --> 01:08:44,354
She's trapped inside the van.

967
01:08:44,374 --> 01:08:46,427
<I>Good. Now get back fast.</I>

968
01:09:13,904 --> 01:09:17,251
Jimmy. In my belt, quick.

969
01:09:18,709 --> 01:09:19,927
Hide it.

970
01:09:32,088 --> 01:09:34,705
We're home free, boys. Well done.

971
01:09:34,725 --> 01:09:37,462
Can we finally kill them now?

972
01:09:39,930 --> 01:09:41,445
We're gonna take 'em
out to the river,

973
01:09:41,465 --> 01:09:44,782
strap those heavy boots on 'em
and dump 'em over the side.

974
01:09:44,802 --> 01:09:48,566
The three of us will be
out of here before you know it.

975
01:09:49,640 --> 01:09:52,322
Shaun-boy, get this loaded
into the truck.

976
01:09:52,342 --> 01:09:53,521
On it.

977
01:09:58,281 --> 01:10:00,296
Well done, missy.

978
01:10:00,316 --> 01:10:02,198
You made it back in one piece.

979
01:10:02,218 --> 01:10:04,435
We kept our end of the deal.
Now keep yours.

980
01:10:04,455 --> 01:10:07,538
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetheart.
That's not gonna happen.

981
01:10:07,558 --> 01:10:10,905
We can't have you running off
to the coppers now, can we?

982
01:10:11,327 --> 01:10:13,376
But that was the agreement.

983
01:10:13,396 --> 01:10:15,512
You know your gullibility is sweet,

984
01:10:15,532 --> 01:10:16,780
you know that?

985
01:10:16,800 --> 01:10:18,616
It's stupid, but it's sweet.

986
01:10:18,636 --> 01:10:21,752
Now go get your boss
and put him in the boat.

987
01:10:21,772 --> 01:10:22,786
What for?

988
01:10:22,806 --> 01:10:24,594
We're giving him a sea burial.

989
01:10:24,842 --> 01:10:26,896
Same as we're gonna give you.

990
01:10:32,116 --> 01:10:33,522
Move.

991
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:05,613
What is going on here?

992
01:11:09,653 --> 01:11:11,898
Just a spot of fishing, officer.

993
01:11:13,289 --> 01:11:15,040
And you need guns for that, do ya?

994
01:11:15,224 --> 01:11:17,608
Drop it.

995
01:11:17,628 --> 01:11:19,491
Kick it away.

996
01:11:30,074 --> 01:11:31,455
Now, all of you,

997
01:11:31,475 --> 01:11:32,856
keep your hands where I can see 'em.

998
01:11:32,876 --> 01:11:34,779
- Sergeant...
- Quiet!

999
01:11:37,681 --> 01:11:41,230
And what about you, big fella? Hmm?

1000
01:11:41,250 --> 01:11:43,646
I said hand over the gun.

1001
01:11:46,990 --> 01:11:48,665
There we go.

1002
01:11:50,259 --> 01:11:51,858
Now kick it away.

1003
01:11:53,063 --> 01:11:55,311
- And what about you two?
- We're hostages.

1004
01:11:55,331 --> 01:11:57,767
- Hostages?
- Yes, we're hostages.

1005
01:12:07,276 --> 01:12:08,952
Freeze!

1006
01:13:17,014 --> 01:13:19,258
Jimmy! Get in the water!

1007
01:13:30,260 --> 01:13:32,655
No-o-o!

1008
01:13:33,297 --> 01:13:34,778
You're dead!

1009
01:13:34,798 --> 01:13:36,584
Both of ya!

1010
01:14:31,154 --> 01:14:32,334
Come on.

1011
01:14:32,789 --> 01:14:35,148
You can't stay down there forever.

1012
01:14:54,978 --> 01:14:56,260
Come on.

1013
01:14:56,280 --> 01:14:57,928
You can hide from me,

1014
01:14:57,948 --> 01:15:01,219
but that shark
won't stay trapped forever!

1015
01:15:16,199 --> 01:15:19,015
I got you, you little bastard.

1016
01:15:24,775 --> 01:15:26,296
Aghh!

1017
01:15:36,987 --> 01:15:38,851
You bitch!

1018
01:16:07,851 --> 01:16:09,030
No...!

1019
01:16:40,717 --> 01:16:43,300
Clara! Get outta there!

1020
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,260
Wamba!

1021
01:16:46,223 --> 01:16:48,239
Get outta there!

1022
01:16:52,497 --> 01:16:53,903
Come on, Clara.

1023
01:17:20,057 --> 01:17:22,706
What are you gonna do
with that, sweetheart?

1024
01:17:22,726 --> 01:17:25,709
Call me that again. I dare you.

1025
01:17:25,729 --> 01:17:28,779
What are ya gonna do?
You gonna shoot me?

1026
01:17:28,799 --> 01:17:31,880
Come on, sweetheart.
What are you waitin' for?

1027
01:17:33,737 --> 01:17:37,198
Not one step closer.

1028
01:17:38,809 --> 01:17:41,205
You're down to your last shot.

1029
01:17:42,112 --> 01:17:43,827
You think you can get me
with one shot?

1030
01:17:43,847 --> 01:17:47,764
I'm a farmer's daughter,
and a better shot than he was.

1031
01:17:47,784 --> 01:17:50,219
That don't make you a killer.

1032
01:17:51,254 --> 01:17:53,232
Are you a killer?

1033
01:17:54,291 --> 01:17:55,470
Are ya?

1034
01:17:57,428 --> 01:17:59,025
No.

1035
01:18:00,063 --> 01:18:01,281
But she is.

1036
01:18:31,728 --> 01:18:33,934
Keep the pressure on it.

1037
01:18:35,799 --> 01:18:38,248
That true, you a farmer's daughter?

1038
01:18:38,268 --> 01:18:40,018
No.

1039
01:18:41,204 --> 01:18:43,372
He was a lawyer.

1040
01:18:43,508 --> 01:18:45,636
You had me fooled.

1041
01:19:45,268 --> 01:19:48,691
Sorry I'm late.
Had to pick up a few things.

1042
01:19:49,306 --> 01:19:50,954
Whose car is that out front?

1043
01:19:50,974 --> 01:19:52,822
Said they wanted to speak to us.

1044
01:19:52,842 --> 01:19:54,592
Been waiting almost an hour.

1045
01:19:54,612 --> 01:19:55,892
Oh, God.

1046
01:19:55,912 --> 01:19:59,298
No more police
or damned journalists. Please.

1047
01:20:00,850 --> 01:20:02,232
Good morning, gentlemen.

1048
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:05,168
I'm so sorry to have kept you
both waiting. I'm Clara.

1049
01:20:05,188 --> 01:20:07,204
Paul Whitemore.
First National Bank of Sydney.

1050
01:20:07,224 --> 01:20:09,640
Frank Sturgess.
Benchley & Shaw Solicitors.

1051
01:20:09,660 --> 01:20:11,174
I represent Ernie's estate.

1052
01:20:11,194 --> 01:20:13,411
Now, Ernie had no family to speak of,

1053
01:20:13,431 --> 01:20:16,480
and, quite bluntly, everything
he owned is in this shed.

1054
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:19,749
But what he did do was,
some time ago, write a will.

1055
01:20:19,769 --> 01:20:22,919
And in that will, he left
everything to you, Jimmy.

1056
01:20:22,939 --> 01:20:26,490
The Sea Dog Diving Company
is all yours. Congratulations.

1057
01:20:26,510 --> 01:20:27,824
Thank you.

1058
01:20:27,844 --> 01:20:30,360
Uh, on top of that,
it seems you were unaware,

1059
01:20:30,380 --> 01:20:33,897
the bank was offering a reward
of twenty five hundred pound

1060
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:35,700
for any information which led

1061
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:38,335
to the successful recovery
of the bullion.

1062
01:20:38,355 --> 01:20:41,606
Now, thanks to you two,
it was recovered in full.

1063
01:20:41,626 --> 01:20:43,184
So...

1064
01:20:43,893 --> 01:20:45,454
the reward is yours.

1065
01:20:48,532 --> 01:20:50,548
Er...

1066
01:20:54,672 --> 01:20:56,019
Thank you.

1067
01:20:56,039 --> 01:20:58,288
I... I don't really know
what else what to say.

1068
01:20:58,308 --> 01:20:59,889
'Thank you' will do fine.

1069
01:20:59,909 --> 01:21:02,259
If you do need anything
in the future,

1070
01:21:02,279 --> 01:21:04,928
please don't hesitate
to contact me personally.

1071
01:21:04,948 --> 01:21:07,801
- Of course.
- Good luck to you both.

1072
01:21:09,819 --> 01:21:11,227
Bye.

1073
01:21:18,295 --> 01:21:20,844
- Give me the keys.
- Where are we going?

1074
01:21:20,864 --> 01:21:22,690
To buy ourselves a boat.
