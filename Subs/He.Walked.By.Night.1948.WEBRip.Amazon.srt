[music playing]

00:01:20,602 --> 00:01:22,560
NARRATOR: This is Los
Angeles-- our lady,

3
00:01:22,604 --> 00:01:25,389
the Queen of the Angels as
the Spaniards named her.

4
00:01:25,433 --> 00:01:27,957
The fastest growing
city in the nation.

5
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,873
It's been called a bunch of
suburbs in search of the city.

6
00:01:30,916 --> 00:01:34,137
And it's been called the
glamour capital of the world.

7
00:01:34,181 --> 00:01:37,619
A mecca for tourists, a
stop over for transients,

8
00:01:37,662 --> 00:01:41,057
a target for gangsters, a haven
from those fleeing from winter,

9
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,103
a home for the hard working.

10
00:01:43,146 --> 00:01:45,279
It is a city holding
the hopes and dreams

11
00:01:45,322 --> 00:01:47,194
of over two million people.

12
00:01:47,237 --> 00:01:50,371
It sprawls out
horizontally over 452

13
00:01:50,414 --> 00:01:53,330
square miles of
valleys and upland,

14
00:01:53,374 --> 00:01:56,072
of foothills and beaches.

15
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:59,858
Because of that vast area and
because of a population made up

16
00:01:59,902 --> 00:02:02,296
of people from every
state in the union,

17
00:02:02,339 --> 00:02:05,429
Los Angeles is the largest
police beat in the country.

18
00:02:05,473 --> 00:02:08,171
And one of the toughest.

19
00:02:08,215 --> 00:02:09,955
We're going to take
you into the City Hall

20
00:02:09,999 --> 00:02:12,349
where police
headquarters are located.

21
00:02:12,393 --> 00:02:16,223
Here in Communications are the
ears and voice of the police.

22
00:02:16,266 --> 00:02:19,182
The lights on the complaint
board flash 24 hours a day--

23
00:02:19,226 --> 00:02:22,011
citizens reporting a
prowler, a lost child,

24
00:02:22,054 --> 00:02:25,710
a man molesting a woman, and
auto accident, a wild party.

25
00:02:25,754 --> 00:02:27,712
Spend an hour or two
here and you would think

26
00:02:27,756 --> 00:02:30,106
the whole city is gone berserk.

27
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,195
Minute by minute the orders
go up to the radio cars

28
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,066
in the far flung divisions.

29
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:36,678
Watson, Wilshire,
and West Los Angeles,

30
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:39,507
Hollywood and Hollenbeck
Heights in North Hollywood.

31
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:44,512
The work of a police, like
that of woman, is never done.

32
00:02:44,555 --> 00:02:47,819
This is the case history of a
killing taken from the files

33
00:02:47,863 --> 00:02:49,995
of the detective division.

34
00:02:50,039 --> 00:02:52,650
The facts are told
here is that happen.

35
00:02:52,694 --> 00:02:55,000
The story properly
starts here in Hollywood

36
00:02:55,044 --> 00:02:57,438
Division Headquarters at one
o'clock of a June morning

37
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,917
last year.

38
00:02:58,961 --> 00:03:01,224
Officer Robert Rawlins had
finished his tour of duty

39
00:03:01,268 --> 00:03:02,573
and signed out.

40
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:03,792
It had been a touch day.

41
00:03:03,835 --> 00:03:05,446
He'd be glad to get home.

42
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:07,230
His wife would be waiting up
for him, as she always did.

43
00:04:58,167 --> 00:04:58,863
Hey, fella.

44
00:04:58,907 --> 00:04:59,690
Come here.

45
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:06,306
What were you doing
back at that radio shop?

46
00:05:06,349 --> 00:05:07,263
Just looking.

47
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,744
Was on my way home.

48
00:05:09,787 --> 00:05:10,832
Live around here?

49
00:05:10,875 --> 00:05:13,313
A couple blocks down.

50
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:14,488
Let me see some identification.

51
00:05:14,531 --> 00:05:15,184
Sure.

52
00:05:18,927 --> 00:05:21,712
Yeah, I guess I
forgot my wallet.

53
00:05:21,756 --> 00:05:24,846
Look, I've got to see
some identification.

54
00:05:24,889 --> 00:05:25,803
How about my Army discharge?

55
00:05:25,847 --> 00:05:26,587
I got it right here.

56
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:28,110

57
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:35,378

00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,806
Well, what have you got so far?

97
00:07:38,849 --> 00:07:43,463
Well, not much, Captain Breen--
a couple of cartridge casings.

98
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:44,420
Hello Marty, Chuck.

99
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:45,682
Aye, Cap.

100
00:07:45,726 --> 00:07:47,118
Eyewitnesses?

101
00:07:47,162 --> 00:07:48,555
Who was first on the
scene-- reported it?

102
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:49,599
I was.

103
00:07:49,643 --> 00:07:50,731
I live here.

104
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:51,906
I'm a light sleeper.

105
00:07:51,949 --> 00:07:52,776
But my hearing is good.

106
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:54,212
And my cat was--

107
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:56,519
Did the officer say
anything before he collapsed?

108
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,521
Yeah, he gave a
description of the fella.

109
00:07:58,565 --> 00:07:59,566
He was--

110
00:07:59,609 --> 00:08:00,958
WOMAN [ON RADIO]:

00:08:01,002 --> 00:08:02,743

Brown hair.

116
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:12,927
Regular features.

117
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,104
Pencil mustache.

118
00:08:16,147 --> 00:08:17,714

-Is that about it?
-Yes, sir.

121
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,544
Exactly.

122
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:25,026
And the officer kept saying,
"he looked like such a nice kid.

123
00:08:25,069 --> 00:08:26,723
He looked like such a nice kid."

124
00:08:26,767 --> 00:08:30,684
As if he couldn't believe
what had happened to him.

125
00:08:30,727 --> 00:08:31,685
I see.

126
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:32,686
Is that all?

127
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:33,687
Yeah.

128
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:35,253
Thank you very much.

00:08:35,297 --> 00:08:37,168
Yeah, well anything else I
can do I'd be glad to help you.

130
00:08:37,212 --> 00:08:38,518
We may call you.

131
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:39,562
Get his name and
address-- will you , Bob?

132
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:44,349
This door been checked, Lee?

133

Yeah.

134
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:45,742
It's OK, Captain.

135
00:08:50,704 --> 00:08:51,705
Find anything?

136
00:08:51,748 --> 00:08:54,577
Nothing but some
smudges so far.

137
00:08:54,621 --> 00:08:56,361
Found this in the
glove compartment.

138
00:08:56,405 --> 00:08:57,101
I think its nitroglycerin.

139
00:08:59,843 --> 00:09:01,541
It doesn't look quite right.

140
00:09:01,584 --> 00:09:02,890
Well, check it down at the lab.

141
00:09:02,933 --> 00:09:03,543
Right.

142
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:12,334
Open this up, Joe.

143
00:09:12,377 --> 00:09:13,814
No key, captain.

144
00:09:13,857 --> 00:09:14,989
Well, pry it open.

145
00:09:15,032 --> 00:09:15,729
Hand me that bar, Frank.

146
00:09:32,876 --> 00:09:35,009
A regular arsenal.

147
00:09:35,052 --> 00:09:36,663
Yeah, get a load of that.

148
00:09:36,706 --> 00:09:37,751
What is it?

149
00:09:37,794 --> 00:09:39,056
I don't know.

150
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,798
It looks like some kind
of an electrical device.

151
00:09:41,842 --> 00:09:44,279
United States Navy.

152
00:09:44,322 --> 00:09:47,543
It's either stolen
or war surplus.

153
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:48,979
Send all this stuff
down to the lab

154
00:09:49,023 --> 00:09:50,807
and check the serial number
on that Navy equipment.

155
00:09:50,851 --> 00:09:52,156
Yes, sir.

156
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,637
Captain Breen, we
found these in the weeds

157
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,205
over by the radio store.

158
00:09:57,248 --> 00:09:58,293
What do you got?

159
00:09:58,336 --> 00:10:00,251
A pair of croc gloves, Captain.

160
00:10:00,295 --> 00:10:02,079
Well, he thought of
everything, didn't he?

161
00:10:02,123 --> 00:10:03,298
All right.

162
00:10:03,341 --> 00:10:04,560
Give them to one
of the technicians.

163
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:05,779
Yes, sir.

164
00:10:05,822 --> 00:10:07,432
Marty, you and Chuck
come along with me.

165
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,652
Let's go downtown and see what
they picked up in the dragnet.

166
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:10,305
Right.

167

Yeah.

170
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:31,065
I know his wife too.

171
00:10:31,108 --> 00:10:32,283
Ever since high school.

172
00:10:36,026 --> 00:10:37,637
Captain, I wish you'd let
Chuck and me handle this case.

173
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:43,468
All right.

174
00:10:43,512 --> 00:10:46,907
I don't want any dead heroes.

175
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,908
Just want the man
who shot Rawlins.

176

around the scene
of the shooting.

181
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,228
Every available radio car
and patrolman and detective

182
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:05,926
was out on the dragnet.

183
00:11:05,969 --> 00:11:08,798
The strings were being
drawn tighter and tighter.

184
00:11:08,842 --> 00:11:11,409
Many a man returning from
a data, or a late party,

185
00:11:11,453 --> 00:11:15,109
or a poker game, surprisingly
found himself in a squad car.

186
00:11:15,152 --> 00:11:17,024
It's sirens screaming
as it brought

187
00:11:17,067 --> 00:11:19,679
him to the detective bureau.

188
00:11:19,722 --> 00:11:21,898
The dragnet gathered
in some strange fish

189
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,727
and many ordinary ones.

190
00:11:24,771 --> 00:11:27,295
All the rest of that night
the detectives probed,

191
00:11:27,338 --> 00:11:30,907
needled, questioned, quizzed.

192
00:11:30,951 --> 00:11:33,257
Everything was
checked-- fingerprints,

193
00:11:33,301 --> 00:11:36,521
names, addresses, stories.

194
00:11:36,565 --> 00:11:38,785
Every fish in the
net was examined.

195
00:11:38,828 --> 00:11:42,092
Most of them thrown back into
the sea, not worth keeping.

196
00:11:42,136 --> 00:11:45,226
Except a few parole violators
and slightly shady characters

197
00:11:45,269 --> 00:11:47,750
whose stories needed
a lot of verifying.

198
00:11:47,794 --> 00:11:50,971
I wasn't prodding no
cars, just taking a walk.

199
00:11:51,014 --> 00:11:52,363
You know, getting in condition.

200
00:11:52,407 --> 00:11:54,757
You were running when the
radio cop picked you up.

201
00:11:54,801 --> 00:11:56,019
Yeah.

202
00:11:56,063 --> 00:11:58,152
Maybe that's why the
guys call me "punchy."

203
00:11:58,195 --> 00:11:59,762
He's got a point there.

204
00:11:59,806 --> 00:12:02,373
Two felony convictions,
no warrant, no warrant.

205
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:03,418
He's on parole.

206
00:12:03,461 --> 00:12:04,158
Book him.

207
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:05,333
Violation of the parole.

208
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:07,378
Let's have the next one, Joe.

209
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:10,599
What were you doing
in that vacant lot?

210
00:12:10,642 --> 00:12:12,209
The vacant lot?

211
00:12:12,253 --> 00:12:13,733
Lot.

212
00:12:13,776 --> 00:12:16,126
What were you doing in
it at that time of night?

213
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:17,388
[non-english speech]

214
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:30,880
You say your name
is Ralph Henderson?

215
00:12:30,924 --> 00:12:32,664
So what?

216
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,188
Well, you know, it's
a funny thing Ralph.

217
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:35,842
There's a guy around
this town that's

218
00:12:35,885 --> 00:12:39,497
been wearing your fingerprints,
only his name is Pete Hannon.

219
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,803
OK.

220
00:12:40,847 --> 00:12:42,979
So I'm dead.

221
00:12:43,023 --> 00:12:46,591
So what's one more
confession in my life?

222
00:12:46,635 --> 00:12:47,854
Now you're talking, Hannon.

223
00:12:47,897 --> 00:12:48,550
OK.

224
00:12:51,031 --> 00:12:52,032
Hello, Harry.

225
00:12:52,075 --> 00:12:53,598
What have we got here?

226
00:12:53,642 --> 00:12:57,211
Oh, some robbery suspects--
candidate's for San Quinten.

227
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:58,995
Handsome here is the big shot.

228
00:12:59,039 --> 00:13:01,998
He runs the outfit.

229
00:13:02,042 --> 00:13:03,957
Have a gander at his record.

230
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,264
Car theft, escape
from reform school,

231
00:13:07,308 --> 00:13:09,963
robbery, assault
with a deadly weapon.

232
00:13:10,006 --> 00:13:11,399
Not bad.

233
00:13:11,442 --> 00:13:12,574
Look at the heater
we found on him.

234
00:13:12,617 --> 00:13:13,314
German Luger.

235
00:13:13,357 --> 00:13:15,620
Fully loaded.

236
00:13:15,664 --> 00:13:17,492
Redhead here tried to carve
up one of the arresting

237
00:13:17,535 --> 00:13:20,712
officers with this pretty toy.

238
00:13:20,756 --> 00:13:22,366
Nice boys.

239
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:24,760
NARRATOR: By dawn, many minor
wrongdoings had been uncovered

240
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,849
and a few incipient felonies.

241
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,982
The checking of the
suspects have been thorough,

242
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,853
painstaking, and tedious.

243
00:13:30,897 --> 00:13:33,116
But all the work
was for nothing.

244
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,684
The man who had shot Officer
Rawlins was not among them.

245
00:13:35,727 --> 00:13:38,165
He remained no more
than a description.

246
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,123
A shadow of a man.

247
00:13:40,167 --> 00:13:43,474
Mysterious, elusive, deadly.

248
00:13:43,518 --> 00:13:45,433
Hidden away somewhere
in the vast city.

249
00:13:49,002 --> 00:13:53,049
As for Rawlins himself,
he couldn't help.

250
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:56,574
He was in a coma at Receiving
Hospital Mrs. Rawlins

251
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:59,273
waited out the long, tense
hours while her husband fought

252
00:13:59,316 --> 00:14:01,014
to live.

253
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:05,627
Many another officers wife had
so waited, many another will.

254
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,238
The word came shortly
after dawn up.

255
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,522
WOMAN [ON RADIO]: A
white male American.

256
00:14:31,566 --> 00:14:33,133
26 or 27.

257
00:14:33,176 --> 00:14:35,570
5 feet 10 or 11.

258
00:14:35,613 --> 00:14:38,573
155 to 165 pounds.

259
00:14:38,616 --> 00:14:39,791
Brown hair.

260
00:14:39,835 --> 00:14:40,705
Regular features.

261
00:14:40,749 --> 00:14:41,358
Pencil mustache.

262
00:14:44,971 --> 00:14:47,408
NARRATOR: This was no
frightened fugitive.

263
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:49,279
What went on in his mind?

264
00:14:49,323 --> 00:14:52,456
Why had he set his hand
against his fellow man.

265
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,068
Taken the life of
another, of a stranger,

266
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:58,506
of a man who was
merely doing his duty.

267
00:14:58,549 --> 00:15:01,291
He must have some
plan, some goal

268
00:15:01,335 --> 00:15:03,598
that called for a sudden death
to anyone who got in his way.

269
00:15:51,428 --> 00:15:52,212
Good morning, boys.

270
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:53,387
Morning, Lee.

271
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:56,912
Hi, Professor.

272
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,480
And I thought this
was safe cracker soup.

273
00:15:59,523 --> 00:16:01,003
You going to drink it, I hope.

274
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,396
I'm really a nice guy.

275
00:16:02,439 --> 00:16:03,092
Stick around.

276
00:16:03,136 --> 00:16:05,312
I'll prove it.

277
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:05,965
Come over here.

278
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:27,943
Hold this for me.

279
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,163
Will you, Chuck?

280
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:30,859
Thank you.

281
00:16:34,123 --> 00:16:35,603
Now if you'll hand me
that hammer, Marty.

282
00:16:38,693 --> 00:16:39,302
Thank you.

283
00:16:49,269 --> 00:16:50,835
Yeah.

284
00:16:50,879 --> 00:16:52,489
Nitroglycerin.

285
00:16:52,533 --> 00:16:56,015
I didn't ask for a collection
of fingers, just fingerprints.

286
00:16:56,058 --> 00:16:57,886
All those nice finger
prints on the car

287
00:16:57,929 --> 00:17:00,280
belong to the man it
was stolen from, Cap.

288
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:01,977
Nothing on the
guns, the pick locks.

289
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:04,240
Not even an interesting smudge.

290
00:17:04,284 --> 00:17:05,676
The gloves.

291
00:17:05,720 --> 00:17:06,416
Common type.

292
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,288
Worn by undertakers.

293
00:17:08,331 --> 00:17:09,289
I'll check on them.

294
00:17:09,332 --> 00:17:10,812
They won't show anything.

295
00:17:10,855 --> 00:17:12,814
What did your
scientific test show?

296
00:17:12,857 --> 00:17:14,685
A couple little things.

297
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:18,080
Tool identification
on these pick locks.

298
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,125
I got one under the scope.
You want to take a look?

299
00:17:19,168 --> 00:17:19,821
Yeah.

300
00:17:30,266 --> 00:17:31,267
Take a look.

301
00:17:34,575 --> 00:17:37,186
I see.

302
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:41,060
Well, it seems to tie the
tool up with the lock.

303
00:17:41,103 --> 00:17:43,975
Now, if that microscope could
only tell us who did it.

304
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:46,761
I'm working on that.

305
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:48,980
You know, only an amateur
would carry that liquid dynamite

306
00:17:49,024 --> 00:17:50,243
in the car.

307
00:17:50,286 --> 00:17:51,809
This boy's no amateur.

308
00:17:51,853 --> 00:17:53,681
He took the precaution
of desensitizing

309
00:17:53,724 --> 00:17:55,857
it so it'll take normal shock.

310
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:57,163
Took a lot of other
precautions too.

311
00:17:57,206 --> 00:17:59,513
No fingerprints,
no identification,

312
00:17:59,556 --> 00:18:01,471
nothing definite.

313
00:18:01,515 --> 00:18:07,477
Except he's scientific-- knows
electricity, is inventive.

314
00:18:07,521 --> 00:18:09,044
Yeah.

315
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:09,740
And happy on the trigger.

316
00:18:14,571 --> 00:18:16,051
This is Captain Breen.

317
00:18:16,095 --> 00:18:18,923
Get me Captain Stevens
at burglary, will you?

318
00:18:18,967 --> 00:18:20,403
I hate to disappoint
you, Lee, but I think

319
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:22,971
you've come up with something.

320
00:18:23,014 --> 00:18:25,147
Hello, Steve?

321
00:18:25,191 --> 00:18:27,106
How are you?

322
00:18:27,149 --> 00:18:30,109
Did your daughter's
marriage come off all right?

323
00:18:30,152 --> 00:18:31,849
Good.

324
00:18:31,893 --> 00:18:35,897
Look, Steve, on those burglaries
of electrical equipment lately,

325
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,899
were there any where pick
locks were used to gain entry?

326
00:18:41,381 --> 00:18:42,904
Good.

327
00:18:42,947 --> 00:18:44,471
Well, let me know if there's
another report of one,

328
00:18:44,514 --> 00:18:45,820
will you?

329
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:47,343
I've got an idea
that Rawlin's killer

330
00:18:47,387 --> 00:18:50,129
may be tied in with those.

331
00:18:50,172 --> 00:18:54,437
And uh-- give my regards
to the newlyweds too.

332
00:18:54,481 --> 00:18:57,310
So long, Steve.

333
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,399
Well, what are you waiting for?

334
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:00,878
You've got a job, haven't you?

335
00:19:00,922 --> 00:19:02,184
Get going.

336
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:03,664
Yeah, let's go, Junior.

337
00:19:03,707 --> 00:19:04,404
Hold this for me.

338
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:05,274
Will you, Lee?

339
00:19:05,318 --> 00:19:05,970
Thanks.

340
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:11,541
NARRATOR: And so with
no fingerprints and only

341
00:19:11,585 --> 00:19:13,978
a vague description to go
by, Sargent Brennan turned

342
00:19:14,022 --> 00:19:15,806
to the modus operandi file.

343
00:19:15,850 --> 00:19:17,852
A criminal, like
any human being,

344
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:20,594
has his own habit patterns--
unconscious traits

345
00:19:20,637 --> 00:19:21,464
that can lead to his downfall.

346
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,169
On the way out, Junior.

347
00:19:30,212 --> 00:19:31,909
Those are the burglars that
used pick locks for entry.

348
00:19:31,953 --> 00:19:33,215
Oh, great.

349
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,608
This narrows it down to
just a couple of hundred

350
00:19:34,651 --> 00:19:36,523
suspects in this area.

351
00:19:36,566 --> 00:19:37,219
Do your math, will you?

352
00:19:41,005 --> 00:19:42,616
It may not be so bad.

353
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,400
This guy has improved
on the system.

354
00:19:44,444 --> 00:19:46,968
Maybe he's left his
trademark of some other job.

355
00:19:47,011 --> 00:19:48,404
Well, here we go.

356
00:19:48,448 --> 00:19:50,928
Legging it all over town
asking a million questions.

357
00:19:50,972 --> 00:19:52,234
It's what your
paid for, isn't it?

358
00:19:52,278 --> 00:19:54,715
Am I paid you associate
with you too, Junior?

359
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:55,890
You could do worse.

360
00:19:55,933 --> 00:19:56,891
Not this year.

361
00:19:56,934 --> 00:19:57,544
Come on.

362
00:20:12,298 --> 00:20:14,996
WOMAN [ON RADIO]:
Car 12 Car 1-2.

363
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,085
In the 10,000 block
on Mississippi.

364
00:20:17,128 --> 00:20:18,782
A 394-15 disturbance.

365
00:20:25,093 --> 00:20:27,008
Car 80-K. Code One.

366
00:20:59,432 --> 00:21:02,130
All units-- on the broadcast
of the suspect arrested

367
00:21:02,173 --> 00:21:04,524
in the shooting of
Patrolman Rawlins,

368
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:05,960
cancel the cancellation.

369
00:21:06,003 --> 00:21:07,048
Suspect released from custody.

370
00:21:23,543 --> 00:21:24,500
Oh.

371
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,023
Hello, Mr. Martin.

372
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:27,460
You'll find Mr. Reeves
in the machine shop.

373
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:45,739
Hello, Roy.

374
00:21:45,782 --> 00:21:47,610
Glad to see you.

375
00:21:47,654 --> 00:21:48,437
How are you, Mr. Reeves?

376
00:21:48,481 --> 00:21:49,264
Fine.

377
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,613
I was hoping you drop in.

378
00:21:50,657 --> 00:21:52,572
I wanted to thank
you for showing us

379
00:21:52,615 --> 00:21:54,487
how to handle that repair job.

380
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,183
Helped a lot.

381
00:22:03,713 --> 00:22:04,453
Well, what have
we got this time?

382
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:12,200
A solar graft.

383
00:22:17,292 --> 00:22:20,034
We have plenty of
these around, Roy.

384
00:22:20,077 --> 00:22:22,950
Not like this one.

385
00:22:22,993 --> 00:22:24,430
Yes, I see.

386
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:26,214
I suppose as usual you've
added your own improvements.

387
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,394
You know, it seems wrong
that a man of your talents

388
00:22:32,438 --> 00:22:36,398
should bother consigning
equipment for rental.

389
00:22:36,442 --> 00:22:38,835
I'd like to see you
devote yourself entirely

390
00:22:38,879 --> 00:22:41,838
to experimental electronics.

391
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:44,624
It'll come one day.

392
00:22:44,667 --> 00:22:45,929
I'll have a place like this.

393
00:22:45,973 --> 00:22:47,844
Why wait?

394
00:22:47,888 --> 00:22:50,151
I've got a pretty
good set up here.

395
00:22:50,194 --> 00:22:52,153
They have modern
equipment to work with,

396
00:22:52,196 --> 00:22:55,809
a lab, and my confidence in you.

397
00:22:55,852 --> 00:22:57,898
Thanks, Mr. Reeves.

398
00:22:57,941 --> 00:22:59,247
I have other plans.

399
00:22:59,290 --> 00:23:01,423
But Roy, you can't
tell where it'll lead.

400
00:23:01,467 --> 00:23:03,730
You might even work your
way around to a percentage

401
00:23:03,773 --> 00:23:06,602
of the business.

402
00:23:06,646 --> 00:23:08,996
I like it this way.

403
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,563
You just rent out my equipment.

404
00:23:10,606 --> 00:23:11,520
Right, Roy.

405
00:23:11,564 --> 00:23:13,130
All right.

406
00:23:13,174 --> 00:23:14,436
Well, if you should
change your mind.

407
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,874
I'm not likely
to change my mind.

408
00:23:17,918 --> 00:23:19,746
I suppose you want me to
set this up for rental too.

409
00:23:23,489 --> 00:23:27,623
Mr. Reeves, you've already got
five pieces of my equipment.

410
00:23:27,667 --> 00:23:29,233
And you'd like to know
what results I've have

411
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:32,106
from the rentals so far, hm?

412
00:23:32,149 --> 00:23:34,848
Well, I can't say
as I blame you.

413
00:23:34,891 --> 00:23:35,936
I think you'll find
this satisfactorily.

414
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:41,855
Satisfactory.

415
00:23:41,898 --> 00:23:43,117
Goodbye, Mr. Reeves.

416
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,814
And you'll come back
again soon, won't you?

417
00:23:44,858 --> 00:23:46,294
Sure.

418
00:23:46,337 --> 00:23:48,557
Oh, incidentally.

419
00:23:48,601 --> 00:23:50,385
How's that television
projector coming along?

420
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:52,692
The one you said would
reflect a 12 foot image?

421
00:23:52,735 --> 00:23:54,345
Still working on it.

422
00:23:54,389 --> 00:23:57,218
I just wanted you to know I've
already set up a rental on it.

423
00:23:57,261 --> 00:24:00,874
In fact, I think
they'd like to buy.

424
00:24:00,917 --> 00:24:02,571
It'll come pretty high.

425
00:24:02,615 --> 00:24:04,443
Oh, money is no consideration
with this customer.

426
00:24:10,057 --> 00:24:11,841
Tell him he can
pick it up tomorrow.

427
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:13,582
I thought you said it
wasn't finished yet?

428
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:14,191
It'll be finished.

429
00:24:23,113 --> 00:24:25,028
It uses an image
fixer and then projects

430
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:25,681
by ordinary incandescents.

431
00:24:28,554 --> 00:24:32,166
Roy, this is the
best television

432
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:34,516
projector I've ever seen.

433
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,083
Let's hope that your
customer thinks so.

434
00:24:36,126 --> 00:24:37,171
He will.

435
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:38,999
[phone buzzing]

436
00:24:40,261 --> 00:24:40,870
Yeah?

437
00:24:44,091 --> 00:24:47,094
Send him right in, Charlotte.

438
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,531
There, you see our
customers is right here.

439
00:24:49,575 --> 00:24:52,621
Begging for the
privilege of buying.

440
00:24:52,665 --> 00:24:53,535
Better be running along.

441
00:24:53,579 --> 00:24:55,189
I'm not much good at business.

442
00:24:55,232 --> 00:24:56,103
Oh, but Roy.

443
00:24:56,146 --> 00:24:59,236
He'll want to congratulate you.

444
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,761
Just see that the
price is right.

445
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,066
All right, Roy.

446
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:04,372
I'll get you a good deal.

447
00:25:04,415 --> 00:25:05,678
So long.

448
00:25:05,721 --> 00:25:06,374
See you.

449
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:13,163
Well, Mr. Dunning, come in.

450
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:17,733
Isn't it a beauty?

451
00:25:30,398 --> 00:25:32,269
It's a beauty, all right.

452
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:33,444
You like it?

453
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:34,837
I certainly do like it.

454
00:25:34,881 --> 00:25:36,578
You see, it's mine.

455
00:25:36,622 --> 00:25:37,492
What do you mean?

456
00:25:37,536 --> 00:25:39,407
Let me have the police.

457
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:40,234
I built it.

458
00:25:40,277 --> 00:25:41,191
Spent years on it.

459
00:25:41,235 --> 00:25:42,845
Well, you must be crazy.

460
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:44,325
Roy built this machine himself.

461
00:25:44,368 --> 00:25:45,848
Your friend is a crook, Paul.

462
00:25:45,892 --> 00:25:46,762
You've been taken in.

463
00:25:46,806 --> 00:25:48,155
Hello?

464
00:25:48,198 --> 00:25:51,593
Get my the burglary detail.

465
00:25:51,637 --> 00:25:54,248
Dear Jim, regarding
your inquiry

466
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,990
on the 38 caliber Smith
and Wesson revolver-- oh,

467
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:59,470
come in boys.

468
00:25:59,514 --> 00:26:01,995
Burglary detail just
sent this report through.

469
00:26:02,038 --> 00:26:03,910
A man named Dunning
reports tracing

470
00:26:03,953 --> 00:26:08,479
a stolen television projector
to the Reeves Electronics Lab.

471
00:26:08,523 --> 00:26:10,786
You think it's a tie
with the Rawlins case?

472
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,484
Well, take a look at this
fella Reeves and see what gives.

473
00:26:13,528 --> 00:26:15,835
I'll notify burglary
we're following up on it.

474
00:26:15,878 --> 00:26:16,749
Right.

475
00:26:16,792 --> 00:26:17,445
Come on, Junior.

476
00:26:21,275 --> 00:26:22,581
What else did he place
with you for rental?

477
00:26:22,624 --> 00:26:24,626
Oh, a number of things.

478
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:27,324
All warn surplus that he
bought on his veteran's rating.

479
00:26:27,368 --> 00:26:28,630
Well, is this more
of his equipment?

480
00:26:28,674 --> 00:26:29,544
Yes.
Yes.

481
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,634
He left it here on consignment.

482
00:26:32,678 --> 00:26:35,855
I'm sure that Roy can
explain everything.

483
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:37,247
Well, maybe he can,
Mr. Reeves, if you'll

484
00:26:37,291 --> 00:26:38,684
tell us where he lives.

485
00:26:38,727 --> 00:26:40,294
But I don't know.

486
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:43,863
Mr. Martin is on
the phone, sir.

487
00:26:43,906 --> 00:26:44,994
I'd better talk to him.

488
00:26:45,038 --> 00:26:46,517
I think so, Mr. Reeves.

489
00:26:46,561 --> 00:26:47,518
I'll take it in the
superintendents office.

490
00:26:57,006 --> 00:26:58,965
Tell him that you sold
the set and his money

491
00:26:59,008 --> 00:27:00,140
is waiting for him here.

492
00:27:00,183 --> 00:27:01,184
Find out what time
he's coming by.

493
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,321
Put Mr. Martin on.

494
00:27:11,978 --> 00:27:12,979
Hello, Roy.

495
00:27:15,372 --> 00:27:16,069
Yes.

496
00:27:16,112 --> 00:27:16,809
Yes.

497
00:27:16,852 --> 00:27:18,506
I sold it.

498
00:27:18,549 --> 00:27:21,378
Your money is
waiting here for you.

499
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:22,292
Yes.

500
00:27:22,336 --> 00:27:24,251
I'll be working late tonight.

501
00:27:24,294 --> 00:27:25,513
What time will you be by?

502
00:27:25,556 --> 00:27:28,429
First thing in the morning.

503
00:27:28,472 --> 00:27:29,996
Well, maybe you better
come in tonight, Roy.

504
00:27:30,039 --> 00:27:33,173
A couple of things
I want cleared up.

505
00:27:33,216 --> 00:27:34,783
Like what?

506
00:27:34,827 --> 00:27:37,264
MR. REEVES [ON TELEPHONE]:
Oh, technical things.

507
00:27:37,307 --> 00:27:39,048
Besides, I don't like to
leave the money in the plant

508
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:39,701
overnight.

509
00:27:43,879 --> 00:27:44,924
How about 8:30?

510
00:27:44,967 --> 00:27:45,707
Fine.

511
00:27:45,751 --> 00:27:47,230
Fine.

512
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:48,492
I'll see you then.

513
00:27:48,536 --> 00:27:50,320
I leave the front door unlocked.

514
00:27:56,152 --> 00:27:57,284
He'll be here at 8:30.

515
00:28:06,336 --> 00:28:09,252
Well, I'll just run along
home and get some dinner.

516
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:11,820
Uh-- We'd like you to
stay too, Mr. Reeves.

517
00:28:11,864 --> 00:28:12,603
Why?

518
00:28:12,647 --> 00:28:13,343
For company.

519
00:28:13,387 --> 00:28:14,083
You want to cooperate.

520
00:28:14,127 --> 00:28:15,519
Don't you, Mr. Reeves?

521
00:28:15,563 --> 00:28:16,259
Certainly.

522
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:17,434
Good.

523
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:18,784
Now, you just wait
in your office.

524
00:28:18,827 --> 00:28:20,829
We'll be around.

525
00:28:20,873 --> 00:28:22,570
Very well.

526
00:28:22,613 --> 00:28:23,440
This way, gentlemen.

527
00:29:46,523 --> 00:29:47,133
Reeves.

528
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:53,574
Is that you, Roy?

529
00:30:01,887 --> 00:30:02,626
Go outside.

530
00:30:02,670 --> 00:30:04,498
Lock that alley door.

531
00:30:18,555 --> 00:30:19,426
Where are you, Roy?

532
00:30:26,128 --> 00:30:27,564
Who's in here?

533
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:28,827
No one.

534
00:30:28,870 --> 00:30:29,479
I'm alone.

535
00:30:35,790 --> 00:30:36,617
Come on in.

536
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:39,272
I've got your money for you.

537
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:40,316
Bring it out here.

538
00:30:42,666 --> 00:30:43,276
All right.

539
00:30:46,409 --> 00:30:47,280
Just a minute.

540
00:31:51,474 --> 00:31:52,084
Oh!

541
00:31:57,219 --> 00:32:00,048
[gun shots]

542
00:34:33,158 --> 00:34:35,116
No.

543
00:34:35,160 --> 00:34:38,511
None of them even
looks like Roy Martin.

544
00:34:38,554 --> 00:34:42,341
He had such a fine face.

545
00:34:42,384 --> 00:34:44,778
Didn't keep him
from carrying a gun.

546
00:34:44,821 --> 00:34:46,127
Or didn't you know that?

547
00:34:46,171 --> 00:34:47,128
No.

548
00:34:47,172 --> 00:34:49,174
I didn't.

549
00:34:49,217 --> 00:34:51,698
I told you all I know--
all he ever told me.

550
00:34:51,741 --> 00:34:53,265
What about his friends?

551
00:34:53,308 --> 00:34:55,397
Didn't he have a girl?

552
00:34:55,441 --> 00:34:56,137
No.

553
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:57,138
No.

554
00:34:57,182 --> 00:34:58,574
I don't think so.

555
00:34:58,618 --> 00:35:02,187
He had no interest in
anything but electronics.

556
00:35:02,230 --> 00:35:04,014
Where'd he pick up the stuff?

557
00:35:04,058 --> 00:35:04,754
Books.

558
00:35:04,798 --> 00:35:07,148
Magazines.

559
00:35:07,192 --> 00:35:08,323
Mostly from the signal call.

560
00:35:08,367 --> 00:35:11,587
He was attached to a radar unit.

561
00:35:11,631 --> 00:35:13,372
Get a teletype off
to the War Department.

562
00:35:13,415 --> 00:35:15,200
It might help.

563
00:35:15,243 --> 00:35:16,375
[buzz]

564
00:35:16,418 --> 00:35:17,724
Yes?

565
00:35:17,767 --> 00:35:18,899
WOMAN [ON TELEPHONE]:
Ready on your call

566
00:35:18,942 --> 00:35:20,379
to Receiving Hospital,
Captain Breen.

567
00:35:20,422 --> 00:35:21,380
Hello.

568
00:35:21,423 --> 00:35:23,251
This is Captain Breen.

569
00:35:23,295 --> 00:35:24,992
What is the latest
report on Sergeant Jones?

570
00:35:31,216 --> 00:35:34,262
I see.

571
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,046
Well, let me know if there's
any change, will you?

572
00:35:39,049 --> 00:35:39,659
Thanks.

573
00:35:43,053 --> 00:35:45,273
Sergeants in pretty
bad shape, Marty.

574
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:47,188
He's paralyzed.

575
00:35:47,232 --> 00:35:48,363
May never walk again.

576
00:35:54,717 --> 00:35:57,329
Oh, I'm sorry.

577
00:35:57,372 --> 00:35:59,635
It's funny that Martin showed
up at 7:00 when he told you he

578
00:35:59,679 --> 00:36:01,246
wouldn't be there until 8:30.

579
00:36:01,289 --> 00:36:03,117
I don't know why.

580
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:05,293
Except he was always
unpredictable.

581
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:07,469
I'll tell you why,
because you warned him.

582
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:08,514
That's why he came early.

583
00:36:08,557 --> 00:36:10,080
That's why he came
in the back way.

584
00:36:10,124 --> 00:36:11,430
But you heard me tell him
the front door would be open.

585
00:36:11,473 --> 00:36:12,692
And the key that let
him in the back way?

586
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:13,780
He must have had one made.

587
00:36:13,823 --> 00:36:15,173
Why don't you
tell us the truth?

588
00:36:15,216 --> 00:36:15,825
CAPTAIN BREEN: Marty.

589
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:27,054
Now look, Paul.

590
00:36:27,097 --> 00:36:29,404
You can make it a lot
easier for us to believe

591
00:36:29,448 --> 00:36:32,102
your story if you just
give us some facts--

592
00:36:32,146 --> 00:36:34,017
something that might help us.

593
00:36:34,061 --> 00:36:37,847
I told you all I know.

594
00:36:37,891 --> 00:36:39,458
I've been gullible, all right.

595
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:42,156
Bet he can make a fool of me.

596
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:45,115
But I'd do anything
to make up for what

597
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,205
he did to Detective Jones.

598
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:48,206
Sure.

599
00:36:48,249 --> 00:36:51,121
Sure you would.

600
00:36:51,165 --> 00:36:52,601
You can go now.

601
00:36:52,645 --> 00:36:55,648
Oh, thanks.

602
00:36:55,691 --> 00:36:56,257
Thanks.

603
00:36:59,478 --> 00:37:01,871
My friends-- they can
vouch for my character.

604
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:02,785
That's good.

605
00:37:02,829 --> 00:37:03,699
We'll call you if we need you.

606
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:06,702
Thank you very much.

607
00:37:06,746 --> 00:37:08,051
I think he's telling
the truth, Marty.

608
00:37:08,095 --> 00:37:09,923
I think he's just
said, like he said.

609
00:37:09,966 --> 00:37:11,577
What about the
stolen stuff he was

610
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,708
trying to peddle for Martin?

611
00:37:12,752 --> 00:37:14,493
We'll use it for bait.

612
00:37:14,536 --> 00:37:18,845
Maybe Martin will come back
for it, then we can ask him.

613
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:20,281
Here.

614
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,718
Nevertheless, I want a 24
hour tail put on Reeves

615
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:25,025
and I want a watch on
his home and his factory.

616
00:37:25,068 --> 00:37:26,766
Right.

617
00:37:26,809 --> 00:37:29,421
You can keep those.

618
00:37:29,464 --> 00:37:30,117
OK, Captain.

619
00:37:35,905 --> 00:37:37,385
NARRATOR: And now the
killer changes his tactics,

620
00:37:37,429 --> 00:37:39,692
his modus operandi.

621
00:37:39,735 --> 00:37:41,346
It would baffle the police.

622
00:37:41,389 --> 00:37:44,740
They always expected burglars
to remain burglars, not

623
00:37:44,784 --> 00:37:46,307
go in for stick ups.

624
00:37:46,351 --> 00:37:48,962
They'd never tie
this up with him.

625
00:37:49,005 --> 00:37:52,748
Wearing a variety of disguises,
coming and going like a shadow,

626
00:37:52,792 --> 00:37:55,055
ready to kill if
cornered, he struck

627
00:37:55,098 --> 00:37:56,926
the bottle stores in
a one-man blitz that

628
00:37:56,970 --> 00:37:58,537
had the robbery detail busy.

629
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,950
The killer, always resourceful,
always thinking along

630
00:38:20,994 --> 00:38:22,952
lines that would
baffle his hunters

631
00:38:22,996 --> 00:38:25,738
had discovered an
ideal avenue of escape.

632
00:38:25,781 --> 00:38:29,263
Under Los Angeles is a vast and
intricate system of huge storm

633
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,352
drains built to
siphon of the flash

634
00:38:31,396 --> 00:38:33,398
floods of the rainy season.

635
00:38:33,441 --> 00:38:34,921
Many of the tunnels
are large enough

636
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,271
for two cars to drive abreast.

637
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,753
Here was 700 miles
of hidden highways,

638
00:38:40,796 --> 00:38:43,538
ideal for the use of someone
who needed to hurry from place

639
00:38:43,582 --> 00:38:45,975
to place without being seen.

640
00:38:46,019 --> 00:38:48,238
Ideally as a hiding place
for guns and supplies

641
00:38:48,282 --> 00:38:48,891
in case of emergency.

642
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,809
Listen, Lee.

643
00:38:53,853 --> 00:38:55,289
Well, the reason I
asked you to come over

644
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,551
is I think I've
hit on something.

645
00:38:56,595 --> 00:38:57,770
An identification?

646
00:38:57,813 --> 00:38:58,553
No, not quite.

647
00:38:58,597 --> 00:39:00,425
But a tie-up.

648
00:39:00,468 --> 00:39:04,385
Now these are the shells from
the gun the killed Rawlins.

649
00:39:04,429 --> 00:39:05,865
These were fired in
the liquor store holdup

650
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:08,041
in which the bandit got away.

651
00:39:08,084 --> 00:39:10,826
And these were fired at Jack.

652
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:14,787
Now, as you know, every ejector,
even in guns of the same model

653
00:39:14,830 --> 00:39:16,876
and caliber is difference.

654
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:21,271
Each one leaves its own mark
on the cartridge casing.

655
00:39:21,315 --> 00:39:27,060
Now look at these fine
striations, this deep gouge.

656
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,017
The same on all three.

657
00:39:33,675 --> 00:39:36,635
In other words, the man who
killed Rollins and the man who

658
00:39:36,678 --> 00:39:39,202
shot at Jones and
Brennan, the stick up

659
00:39:39,246 --> 00:39:41,422
was blitzing the liquor
stores are all the same man.

660
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:42,902
Right.

661
00:39:42,945 --> 00:39:44,382
All we need to know is
what that man looks like.

662
00:39:49,256 --> 00:39:51,606
Get me Chandler in
robbery, will you?

663
00:39:51,650 --> 00:39:54,217
I've got an idea about that.

664
00:39:54,261 --> 00:39:55,697
Also it'll give us a
chance to see if Reeves

665
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:58,091
is on the level with us.

666
00:39:58,134 --> 00:39:59,397
Uh-- Steve?

667
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,920
Breen.

668
00:40:00,963 --> 00:40:03,270
About those blitz
hold ups you're on.

669
00:40:03,313 --> 00:40:05,011
Round up all the victims and
have them down her tonight,

670
00:40:05,054 --> 00:40:06,882
will you?

671
00:40:06,926 --> 00:40:09,537
Oh, it's just a little scheme.

672
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:10,233
Thanks, Steve.

673
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:16,936
That's good.

674
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:18,503
Now, sketch another one of
the same type, only this time

675
00:40:18,546 --> 00:40:19,460
thin it out a little.

676
00:40:19,504 --> 00:40:20,287
-All right.
-Hi, Lee.

677
00:40:20,330 --> 00:40:21,114
How's it coming?

678
00:40:21,157 --> 00:40:21,984
You' ready for the night?

679
00:40:22,028 --> 00:40:23,333
We'll be ready.

680
00:40:23,377 --> 00:40:24,552
Think it'll work?

681
00:40:24,596 --> 00:40:25,640
It should.

682
00:40:25,684 --> 00:40:27,512
Where'd you get the idea?

683
00:40:27,555 --> 00:40:29,818
From a kidnapping
case in Chicago.

684
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:31,472
I thought these slides
might be an improvement

685
00:40:31,516 --> 00:40:32,691
over the method they used.

686
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:33,822
Could be.

687
00:40:33,866 --> 00:40:35,128
Captain thinks so.

688
00:40:40,307 --> 00:40:41,656
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

689
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:44,703
May I have your attention
for a moment, please?

690
00:40:44,746 --> 00:40:48,141
You all are going to sit-in on
a little experiment tonight.

691
00:40:48,184 --> 00:40:52,058
We're going to try to build
a picture of a face-- a face

692
00:40:52,101 --> 00:40:56,976
of a man who's cunning,
resourceful, and definitely.

693
00:40:57,019 --> 00:40:59,674
He's a man who killed
a police officer.

694
00:40:59,718 --> 00:41:03,156
Now, some of you he held
up at the point of a gun.

695
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:06,812
You may have seen this face,
remembered something about him.

696
00:41:06,855 --> 00:41:11,251
And we want you to tell us
exactly what you remember,

697
00:41:11,294 --> 00:41:15,821
whether it's his hair,
eyes, nose, or mouth.

698
00:41:15,864 --> 00:41:18,737
And we're going to try to
put those pieces together

699
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:20,303
so that they add
up into a picture

700
00:41:20,347 --> 00:41:22,915
of the face of the man we want.

701
00:41:22,958 --> 00:41:26,571
Now, you can see how
we're depending on you.

702
00:41:26,614 --> 00:41:29,138
Lights.

703
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:31,576
Now first, we're going to
concentrate on the type of hair

704
00:41:31,619 --> 00:41:33,621
our man had.

705
00:41:33,665 --> 00:41:36,189
And if the picture looks
anything like his hair,

706
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:37,756
I want you to speak right up.

707
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:38,757
All right.

708
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:39,540
The first slide, Lee.

709
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:48,723
His hair had waves in it.

710
00:41:48,767 --> 00:41:49,942
Well groomed.

711
00:41:49,985 --> 00:41:51,117
That's the idea, Miss Smith.

712
00:41:58,690 --> 00:41:59,995
Is that any closer?

713
00:42:00,039 --> 00:42:01,562
Um, no.

714
00:42:01,606 --> 00:42:02,824
It was parted on the side.

715
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,962
Oh that's more like it.

716
00:42:10,005 --> 00:42:10,876
Except it was thicker.

717
00:42:19,145 --> 00:42:21,408
Oh, that's very close.

718
00:42:21,451 --> 00:42:23,149
Yes, that's the way
his forehead looked.

719
00:42:23,192 --> 00:42:25,107
It was broad and high.

720
00:42:25,151 --> 00:42:27,196
All right, hold that slide.

721
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:29,024
Now, the next series
of slides will

722
00:42:29,068 --> 00:42:30,156
take into account his eyes.

723
00:42:38,991 --> 00:42:39,687
Oh, one minute, please.

724
00:42:39,731 --> 00:42:40,688
Wait.

725
00:42:40,732 --> 00:42:41,863
One minutes.

726
00:42:41,907 --> 00:42:44,170
His eyes were a
little like that.

727
00:42:44,213 --> 00:42:49,044
Maybe a little
smaller-- like beans.

728
00:42:49,088 --> 00:42:49,915
Go on, Lee.

729
00:42:57,139 --> 00:42:58,967
Now-- now you've got it.

730
00:42:59,011 --> 00:43:01,796
Now hold that slide, Lee.

731
00:43:01,840 --> 00:43:04,930
Anyone else?

732
00:43:04,973 --> 00:43:07,106
That looks like him,
only a little madder.

733
00:43:07,149 --> 00:43:09,195
He had a patch over one eye
when he come into my dive--

734
00:43:09,238 --> 00:43:10,849
uh-- my place of business.

735
00:43:10,892 --> 00:43:13,808
I remember noticing the
one showing was blue.

736
00:43:13,852 --> 00:43:16,506
Well, the guy that stuck me
up had horn-rimmed glasses.

737
00:43:16,550 --> 00:43:18,204
He was wearing a
Bandaid across his nose

738
00:43:18,247 --> 00:43:20,075
when he knocked me over.

739
00:43:20,119 --> 00:43:21,511
Hmm.

740
00:43:21,555 --> 00:43:22,251
All right.

741
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:23,992
Hold that, Lee.

742
00:43:24,036 --> 00:43:25,472
Well, so much for the eyes.

743
00:43:28,170 --> 00:43:28,780
Go ahead.

744
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:46,058
[speaking spanish]

745
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,103
Yes, Miss Montavo?

746
00:43:48,147 --> 00:43:50,889
I-- [speaking spanish]

747
00:43:50,932 --> 00:43:52,281
[speaking spanish]

748
00:43:52,325 --> 00:44:00,638
[speaking spanish]

749
00:44:00,681 --> 00:44:01,464
Like that, Captain.

750
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:03,075
But more snuff-- wider.

751
00:44:03,118 --> 00:44:03,728
Try another one, Lee.

752
00:44:08,994 --> 00:44:11,605
[speaking spanish]

753
00:44:11,649 --> 00:44:13,172
She says that's about it.

754
00:44:13,215 --> 00:44:15,957
Thank you very
much, Miss Montavo.

755
00:44:16,001 --> 00:44:18,873
Get Reeves.

756
00:44:18,917 --> 00:44:20,266
Anymore comments?

757
00:44:20,309 --> 00:44:21,354
MAN 1: That's pretty
close, all right.

758
00:44:21,397 --> 00:44:22,660
Pretty close.

759
00:44:22,703 --> 00:44:24,052
MAN 2: Perfect.

760
00:44:24,096 --> 00:44:25,793
All right, now let's start
on the mouth and chin.

761
00:44:25,837 --> 00:44:26,446
The next series, Lee.

762
00:44:30,711 --> 00:44:33,235
I think his lower
lip stuck out lower.

763
00:44:33,279 --> 00:44:37,762
The mouth was thin and
mean, like it never laughed.

764
00:44:37,805 --> 00:44:40,503
Go ahead.

765
00:44:40,547 --> 00:44:41,983
Something like that,
but thicker lips.

766
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:47,032
There.

767
00:44:47,075 --> 00:44:48,381
That's it.

768
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:49,687
That's him.

769
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:50,600
All right.

770
00:44:50,644 --> 00:44:52,733
Now hold that right there, Lee.

771
00:44:52,777 --> 00:44:53,473
Oh.

772
00:44:53,516 --> 00:44:56,215
Come in, Mr. Reeves.

773
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:58,347
Good evening, Captain.

774
00:44:58,391 --> 00:44:59,218
Did you ever see
that face before?

775
00:45:03,178 --> 00:45:06,007
Oh, it's Roy.

776
00:45:06,051 --> 00:45:07,792
Except for the hair being a
little lighter and the eyebrows

777
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:11,317
a little heavier, it's Roy.

778
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,448
You're sure?

779
00:45:12,492 --> 00:45:13,362
I'm positive.

780
00:45:13,406 --> 00:45:14,146
I'd know him anywhere.

781
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:19,891
Lee, I want to
retouch the photograph.

782
00:45:19,934 --> 00:45:22,676
Now, lighten the hair and give
more body to the eyebrows.

783
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:23,764
Right.

784
00:45:23,808 --> 00:45:24,460
Lights.

785
00:45:27,072 --> 00:45:28,073
That's all.

786
00:45:28,116 --> 00:45:28,900
Thank you very much.

787
00:45:28,943 --> 00:45:30,553
You've been a great help.

788
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:33,513
It's positively amazing how you
found out what he looks like.

789
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:35,776
Well, we're look for an
amazing criminal, Mrs. Johnson.

790
00:45:35,820 --> 00:45:37,082
Thank you, and good night.

791
00:45:37,125 --> 00:45:39,258
Goodnight, Captain.

792
00:45:39,301 --> 00:45:41,913
NARRATOR: And so the face of
the unknown killer built up

793
00:45:41,956 --> 00:45:45,917
from fragments of evidence was
sent out all over the country--

794
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,789
to chiefs of police, to
sheriffs, to county constables,

795
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:54,708
and county jailers, to
the wardens of prisons,

796
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:59,147
to all post masters
and postal inspectors,

797
00:45:59,191 --> 00:46:05,066
to the agents of the Treasury
Department, to the FBI.

798
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:08,504
They showed that picture to the
inmates of jails and prisons,

799
00:46:08,548 --> 00:46:10,942
to men with a wide acquaintance
among the cat burglars

800
00:46:10,985 --> 00:46:14,554
and the violence boys, informers
and con men and sharp shooters

801
00:46:14,597 --> 00:46:17,209
were quizzed, those
on the fringe of crime

802
00:46:17,252 --> 00:46:19,341
and those deep in the rackets.

803
00:46:19,385 --> 00:46:22,605
Many wanted to
help, nobody could.

804
00:46:22,649 --> 00:46:24,259
No one in the
underworld recognized

805
00:46:24,303 --> 00:46:26,000
that mysterious face.

806
00:46:26,044 --> 00:46:28,742
He was as unknown as if he
had lived in the 16th century.

807
00:48:03,532 --> 00:48:04,098
Reeves.

808
00:48:06,884 --> 00:48:08,755
Roy.

809
00:48:08,798 --> 00:48:09,625
Listen carefully, Reeves.

810
00:48:12,367 --> 00:48:14,892
Control yourself.

811
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,329
I know you're
alone in the house.

812
00:48:17,372 --> 00:48:19,418
Act like you're
alone/ The cops are

813
00:48:19,461 --> 00:48:20,723
watching every move you make.

814
00:48:20,767 --> 00:48:21,463
The police?

815
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:23,639
Here?

816
00:48:23,683 --> 00:48:25,467
They've got you staked
out like a muskrat hide,

817
00:48:25,511 --> 00:48:27,817
watching you around the
clock-- here, at your plant,

818
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:28,470
tailing your car.

819
00:48:31,212 --> 00:48:31,909
Sit in that chair.

820
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:37,740
Pick up three books.

821
00:48:43,355 --> 00:48:44,486
Don't look up and
don't answer me.

822
00:48:47,359 --> 00:48:49,927
All right.

823
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:51,580
Now glance at the books.

824
00:48:57,151 --> 00:48:57,804
Pick up one of them.

825
00:49:03,244 --> 00:49:05,072
OK.

826
00:49:05,116 --> 00:49:06,944
Now that's the book you want
to read before you go to bed.

827
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:10,904
Now, get up and
turn off the lamp.

828
00:49:18,085 --> 00:49:19,957
Come here.

829
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,609
ROY: Come here.

830
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:30,793
Go in the den.

831
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:39,715
Pull those drapes tight.

832
00:50:04,262 --> 00:50:05,480
Now get away from them.

833
00:50:11,182 --> 00:50:14,141
What do the cops know about me?

834
00:50:14,185 --> 00:50:16,578
Not very much, Roy.

835
00:50:16,622 --> 00:50:17,927
No fingerprints.

836
00:50:17,971 --> 00:50:18,885
They haven't even
got a picture of you.

837
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:19,886
They're trying to make one.

838
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:28,112
How much cash you
got in the house?

839
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:29,287
None.

840
00:50:29,330 --> 00:50:30,940
I never keep any
cash in the house.

841
00:50:30,984 --> 00:50:32,942
It isn't good business.

842
00:50:32,986 --> 00:50:34,727
I suppose you think
it was good business

843
00:50:34,770 --> 00:50:36,033
letting me walk into that trap.
-No.

844
00:50:36,076 --> 00:50:36,946
I don't.

845
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:37,904
Don't do anything you'll regret.

846
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:39,253
Now, listen to me.

847
00:50:39,297 --> 00:50:40,428
It isn't too late.

848
00:50:40,472 --> 00:50:41,603
Give yourself up,
come to your senses

849
00:50:41,647 --> 00:50:42,865
before you kill someone else.

850
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:53,441
What do you mean, someone else?

851
00:50:53,485 --> 00:50:54,312
What do you mean?

852
00:50:54,355 --> 00:50:55,878
Nothing.

853
00:50:55,922 --> 00:50:59,230
The two officers, they
said one of them might die.

854
00:50:59,273 --> 00:51:03,712
But he's still alive, isn't he?

855
00:51:03,756 --> 00:51:06,715
Reeves, I never thought
you'd stooge for the police.

856
00:51:09,805 --> 00:51:10,806
You almost got me killed.

857
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:11,981
Come on Roy.

858
00:51:12,025 --> 00:51:12,895
You know the police
are right outside.

859
00:51:12,939 --> 00:51:14,593
You'd never get away with it.

860
00:51:20,729 --> 00:51:23,297
That's right.

861
00:51:23,341 --> 00:51:23,993
Now you're being sensible.

862
00:51:28,737 --> 00:51:30,261
I know there's money here.

863
00:51:30,304 --> 00:51:31,262
Where is it?

864
00:51:31,305 --> 00:51:32,219
Don't, Roy.

865
00:51:32,263 --> 00:51:32,915
I'll get it.

866
00:51:53,719 --> 00:51:55,373
It's not enough.

867
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:57,505
The stuff you've got of
mine is worth thousands.

868
00:51:57,549 --> 00:52:00,029
I'll get more.

869
00:52:00,073 --> 00:52:02,728
Get it and keep it handy.

870
00:52:02,771 --> 00:52:04,469
I'll be back next
week or next month,

871
00:52:04,512 --> 00:52:06,601
but get it and have it ready.

872
00:52:06,645 --> 00:52:07,733
Just give me time.

873
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:17,612
PAUL REEVES: Oh!

874
00:52:17,656 --> 00:52:21,355
Look, I don't want
policeman out side my house

875
00:52:21,399 --> 00:52:23,705
or following me around.

876
00:52:23,749 --> 00:52:26,186
That's what made Roy suspicious.

877
00:52:26,230 --> 00:52:28,057
I'm leaving in the morning.

878
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,234
I'm afraid I'll have
to disappoint you, Paul.

879
00:52:30,277 --> 00:52:33,759
Unfortunately, you're our bait.

880
00:52:33,802 --> 00:52:35,195
I won't do it.

881
00:52:35,239 --> 00:52:37,197
I've done enough.

882
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,808
Look, no one's done enough
until we find this killer.

883
00:52:43,072 --> 00:52:45,640
I asked you to keep look
out on this house, Marty.

884
00:52:45,684 --> 00:52:47,207
I did.

885
00:52:47,251 --> 00:52:48,600
Two of the best undercover
men in the department

886
00:52:48,643 --> 00:52:49,949
were assigned here.

887
00:52:49,992 --> 00:52:52,212
That didn't keep
Martin from getting in.

888
00:52:52,256 --> 00:52:52,995
What's the matter?

889
00:52:53,039 --> 00:52:53,648
You tired?

890
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:05,225
You got any idea
how long you've

891
00:53:05,269 --> 00:53:07,271
been on this case, Marty?

892
00:53:07,314 --> 00:53:09,316
Months.

893
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:10,839
Long enough to have come up
with something by this time.

894
00:53:13,929 --> 00:53:15,627
You know any more about
more about the Rawlins killer

895
00:53:15,670 --> 00:53:17,629
than you knew the first week?

896
00:53:17,672 --> 00:53:20,197
Yeah, that he's
about the toughest

897
00:53:20,240 --> 00:53:23,156
nut I've ever had to crack.

898
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:24,940
That's what I told the
chief when he called me

899
00:53:24,984 --> 00:53:26,246
in this afternoon
wanted to know why

900
00:53:26,290 --> 00:53:29,467
the case hadn't been broken.

901
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:30,859
Look, Captain.

902
00:53:30,903 --> 00:53:35,995
Rawlins was a friend
of mine, so was Chuck.

903
00:53:36,038 --> 00:53:39,564
I've got a bigger stake in
this than the chief knows.

904
00:53:39,607 --> 00:53:43,045
I'm doing everything I can.

905
00:53:43,089 --> 00:53:44,699
I'm afraid it's
not enough, Marty.

906
00:53:48,442 --> 00:53:51,445
Maybe you're too close
to it to see it clearly.

907
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:56,233
Maybe it needs a fresh
team, a new viewpoint.

908
00:53:56,276 --> 00:53:59,671
I think you better take a
couple weeks off, Marty.

909
00:53:59,714 --> 00:54:00,324
Starting tomorrow.

910
00:54:03,631 --> 00:54:04,241
Anything you say, Captain.

911
00:54:20,126 --> 00:54:20,822
Hiya, Marty.

912
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:22,084
Hi, Chuck.

913
00:54:22,128 --> 00:54:24,522
Meet Miss Scanion,
my new body guard.

914
00:54:24,565 --> 00:54:26,088
He's the one I've been
telling you about.

915
00:54:26,132 --> 00:54:28,308
Oh, you mean the one
with the steel trap brain.

916
00:54:28,352 --> 00:54:29,091
How do you do?

917
00:54:29,135 --> 00:54:29,962
Hello.

918
00:54:30,005 --> 00:54:31,006
Say, this guy been behaving?

919
00:54:31,050 --> 00:54:32,312
-After a fashion.
-See.

920
00:54:32,356 --> 00:54:34,140
She takes me out in my
go-cart, puts me to bed,

921
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:35,881
wakes me up, dresses me.

922
00:54:35,924 --> 00:54:38,231
You're perfectly capable
of dressing yourself now,

923
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,624
Mr. Jones.

924
00:54:39,667 --> 00:54:41,016
I'll be back in a few minutes.

925
00:54:44,368 --> 00:54:46,674
Well, how's it
been going, junior?

926
00:54:46,718 --> 00:54:48,197
Oh, pretty good, Chuck.

927
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:50,025
Pretty good.

928
00:54:50,069 --> 00:54:52,898
Is that's why
you're off the case?

929
00:54:52,941 --> 00:54:53,986
How'd you know?

930
00:54:54,029 --> 00:54:55,640
Breen was in to
see me this morning.

931
00:54:55,683 --> 00:54:57,337
Oh.

932
00:54:57,381 --> 00:54:59,687
I suppose he also told you they
put a new team on the case.

933
00:54:59,731 --> 00:55:01,863
He told me everything.

934
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,344
Yeah, lets see what
his new boys dig up.

935
00:55:04,388 --> 00:55:06,346
Maybe they'll examine the
facts of the case a little more

936
00:55:06,390 --> 00:55:07,869
carefully.

937
00:55:07,913 --> 00:55:10,959
What facts-- In a man's
shop, highly intelligent,

938
00:55:11,003 --> 00:55:12,483
works alone?

939
00:55:12,526 --> 00:55:13,788
That he has no record,
never leaves a fingerprint,

940
00:55:13,832 --> 00:55:15,529
knows every more we make?

941
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,270
Sure, plenty of facts, only
they add up to nothing.

942
00:55:17,314 --> 00:55:18,010
Sure.

943
00:55:18,053 --> 00:55:19,054
Forget it.

944
00:55:19,098 --> 00:55:20,360
You got yourself
a 10 day vacation.

945
00:55:20,404 --> 00:55:22,493
Go on down to the
beach, get a suntan.

946
00:55:22,536 --> 00:55:25,365
By the time you get back
the case will be broken.

947
00:55:25,409 --> 00:55:26,714
Isn't that what you want?

948
00:55:26,758 --> 00:55:27,802
You know it better than that.

949
00:55:27,846 --> 00:55:29,064
All I know is what I hear.

950
00:55:29,108 --> 00:55:30,588
You sit there batting
your gums about how

951
00:55:30,631 --> 00:55:32,198
the old man let you down.

952
00:55:32,241 --> 00:55:33,982
Maybe he's trying
to wake you up.

953
00:55:34,026 --> 00:55:35,244
He's got a funny
way of showing it.

954
00:55:35,288 --> 00:55:37,246
There you go, flying
off the handle-- always

955
00:55:37,290 --> 00:55:38,683
taking things for granted.

956
00:55:38,726 --> 00:55:41,381
I wish I could get up and
boot some sense into you.

957
00:55:41,425 --> 00:55:42,861
He knew what this
case meant to me.

958
00:55:42,904 --> 00:55:44,297
He still does.

959
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:45,211
That's why he's trying
to get you mad enough

960
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:45,951
to do something about it.

961
00:55:49,694 --> 00:55:51,652
You don't really figure
that his idea, do you?

962
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:54,394
I know it is.

963
00:55:54,438 --> 00:55:56,396
Ah, its a tough case, Chuck.

964
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:58,398
Not an angle, nothing to go on.

965
00:55:58,442 --> 00:56:01,053
You'd know what I met if you
were out working with me.

966
00:56:01,096 --> 00:56:02,576
I have been working with you.

967
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:04,361
That's all I've had
to do lately, just

968
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:06,972
sit around studying what
little facts we have trying

969
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:09,322
to figure out who we might be.

970
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:11,629
You know the kind of a
guy we're up against then.

971
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:13,195
I tell ya, Chuck.

972
00:56:13,239 --> 00:56:15,328
This guy's a genius
the way he operates.

973
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:16,721
As if were right there
with us every time

974
00:56:16,764 --> 00:56:17,635
we go our after a lead.

975
00:56:17,678 --> 00:56:19,288
Oh, sure.

976
00:56:19,332 --> 00:56:21,073
Breen's been tipping him off
just to make you look bad.

977
00:56:21,116 --> 00:56:23,423
I almost like that.

978
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:25,773
The way he beats us to
the punch every time.

979
00:56:25,817 --> 00:56:27,384
There's you angle.

980
00:56:27,427 --> 00:56:28,733
You just hit it on the
head, but you don't see it.

981
00:56:28,776 --> 00:56:30,125
Look, start adding.

982
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:32,563
One-- he's unknown
to the underworld.

983
00:56:32,606 --> 00:56:35,304
Two-- he beats you
to the punch, right?

984
00:56:35,348 --> 00:56:37,394
And three-- it's almost
as if he were with you.

985
00:56:37,437 --> 00:56:38,395
Isn't that what you said?

986
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:39,831
Yeah.

987
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:41,398
Well, tie that up with a
lot of other little things,

988
00:56:41,441 --> 00:56:43,965
like the fact that he uses a
police gun, and the accuracy

989
00:56:44,009 --> 00:56:45,663
of the shooting.

990
00:56:45,706 --> 00:56:47,839
Anybody could buy a police
gun, and the Army could've

991
00:56:47,882 --> 00:56:49,275
taught him how to shoot.

992
00:56:49,318 --> 00:56:50,450
Yeah, but who taught him
how the police operate?

993
00:56:54,062 --> 00:56:55,107
I know what you're
driving at, Chuck.

994
00:56:55,150 --> 00:56:57,718
But-- but a cop?

995
00:56:57,762 --> 00:57:00,155
Those things happen.

996
00:57:00,199 --> 00:57:01,200
Yeah.

997
00:57:01,243 --> 00:57:02,419
Now, if I were
still on the case

998
00:57:02,462 --> 00:57:03,985
I'd start with
out own department

999
00:57:04,029 --> 00:57:06,945
first, then Santa Monica,
Culver City, Burbank, Pasadena.

1000
00:57:06,988 --> 00:57:08,468
See you later, Junior.

1001
00:57:08,512 --> 00:57:10,209
Hey-- Don't let him out
of your sight, beautiful.

1002
00:57:10,252 --> 00:57:12,341
That was the first time in
years he's used his head.

1003
00:57:21,873 --> 00:57:23,265
But you get a print
of every mug we take.

1004
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:25,093
We always send LA
a copy, Sergeant.

1005
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:26,051
It's personnel photos I want.

1006
00:57:26,094 --> 00:57:26,704
You mean [inaudible]?

1007
00:57:31,230 --> 00:57:32,710
That's Rawlins
killer, isn't it?

1008
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:34,059
That's right.

1009
00:57:34,102 --> 00:57:35,756
You checked your
own department.

1010
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:36,453
We did that first.

1011
00:57:42,676 --> 00:57:45,244
NARRATOR: And so the
tedious quest went on.

1012
00:57:45,287 --> 00:57:48,290
Sergeant Brennan wore out his
shoes and his patience going

1013
00:57:48,334 --> 00:57:50,510
from police station
to police station,

1014
00:57:50,554 --> 00:57:53,295
checking photos until
his eyes were blurry.

1015
00:57:53,339 --> 00:57:54,993
For police work
is not all glamour

1016
00:57:55,036 --> 00:57:56,864
and excitement and glory.

1017
00:57:56,908 --> 00:57:59,606
There are days and
days of routine,

1018
00:57:59,650 --> 00:58:05,003
of tedious probing, of tireless
searching, fruitless days.

1019
00:58:05,046 --> 00:58:08,441
Days when nothing goes right,
when it seems as if no one

1020
00:58:08,485 --> 00:58:10,922
could ever think his way through
the maze of baffling trails

1021
00:58:10,965 --> 00:58:13,011
a criminals leaves.

1022
00:58:13,054 --> 00:58:16,667
But the answer to that is
persistence and the hope

1023
00:58:16,710 --> 00:58:20,409
that sooner or later something
will turn up, some tiny lead

1024
00:58:20,453 --> 00:58:22,890
that can grow into a
warm trail and point

1025
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:24,326
to the cracking of a tough case.

1026
00:58:38,558 --> 00:58:40,429
Well, that does it, boys.

1027
00:58:40,473 --> 00:58:43,215
Can't say I'm sorry you
didn't find him in here.

1028
00:58:43,258 --> 00:58:45,217
I'd hate to think it was a cop.

1029
00:58:45,260 --> 00:58:47,698
Doesn't seem to be anybody.

1030
00:58:47,741 --> 00:58:50,570
Just a lot of pieces of a
face that never existed.

1031
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:52,485
Do you mind if
I see that again?

1032
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,225
Sure.

1033
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:54,400
Frame it.

1034
00:58:54,443 --> 00:58:56,141
Put it on your dresser.

1035
00:58:56,184 --> 00:58:57,403
Wait a minute.

1036
00:58:57,446 --> 00:58:59,013
He wasn't a cop.

1037
00:58:59,057 --> 00:59:02,539
He was a radio technician right
here in our dispatch office.

1038
00:59:02,582 --> 00:59:03,627
What did you say?

1039
00:59:03,670 --> 00:59:06,325
I'm saying he
worked here in '42.

1040
00:59:06,368 --> 00:59:07,587
Well come on, give.

1041
00:59:07,631 --> 00:59:09,937
I remember the kid well.

1042
00:59:09,981 --> 00:59:11,591
He was sort of
strange, never bothered

1043
00:59:11,635 --> 00:59:14,812
with anyone in the department,
just kept to himself.

1044
00:59:14,855 --> 00:59:17,597
He was in line for a
promotion when he was drafted.

1045
00:59:17,641 --> 00:59:19,773
Where was he
living at the time?

1046
00:59:19,817 --> 00:59:22,384
I don't remember

1047
00:59:22,428 --> 00:59:23,037
Try the dead files.

1048
00:59:28,477 --> 00:59:30,610
He never asked for his
job back after the war.

1049
00:59:30,654 --> 00:59:32,177
I remember writing to
him about it though.

1050
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,482
He was an excellent worker.

1051
00:59:33,526 --> 00:59:35,093
Oh yeah, here we are.

1052
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:35,833
Yeah.

1053
00:59:35,876 --> 00:59:37,661
This is it.

1054
00:59:37,704 --> 00:59:39,140
Took a while before he answered.

1055
00:59:39,184 --> 00:59:41,273
But like he says in the
letter, he wasn't interested.

1056
00:59:50,195 --> 00:59:51,936
Postmarked Hollywood.

1057
00:59:51,979 --> 00:59:53,720
No return address.

1058
00:59:53,764 --> 00:59:56,070
What do you want us
to do-- all the work?

1059
00:59:56,114 --> 00:59:58,856
Oh, thanks a lot, Freddy.

1060
00:59:58,899 --> 01:00:00,248
Remember, he was a
civilian employee.

1061
01:00:10,998 --> 01:00:11,912
Well, how about it?

1062
01:00:11,956 --> 01:00:14,349
Anybody recognize him?

1063
01:00:14,393 --> 01:00:17,004
Not on my route.

1064
01:00:17,048 --> 01:00:19,267
I never saw him before.

1065
01:00:19,311 --> 01:00:20,007
Yeah?

1066
01:00:20,051 --> 01:00:21,052
OK, fellas.

1067
01:00:21,095 --> 01:00:21,705
Thanks very much.

1068
01:00:26,100 --> 01:00:31,453
I thought for a minute-- no.

1069
01:00:31,497 --> 01:00:33,499
And yet, that face.

1070
01:00:33,542 --> 01:00:34,239
I wonder--

1071
01:00:34,282 --> 01:00:35,849
Yeah?

1072
01:00:35,893 --> 01:00:37,329
Well, this may
not mean anything.

1073
01:00:37,372 --> 01:00:39,418
But he looks like a
guy that on my route.

1074
01:00:39,461 --> 01:00:40,941
He never gets any
mail, but I see

1075
01:00:40,985 --> 01:00:42,377
him around there all the time.

1076
01:00:42,421 --> 01:00:43,770
He lives in one of the courts.

1077
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:44,553
Where?

1078
01:00:44,597 --> 01:00:45,293
Come on.

1079
01:00:45,337 --> 01:00:46,512
I'll show you.

1080
01:00:46,555 --> 01:00:49,123
It's not that easy.

1081
01:00:49,167 --> 01:00:51,909
What time does your route
take you past those courts?

1082
01:00:51,952 --> 01:00:52,692
About nine o'clock.

1083
01:00:52,736 --> 01:00:54,085
Why?

1084
01:00:54,128 --> 01:00:54,738
Just thinking.

1085
01:01:05,618 --> 01:01:06,271
Hey!

1086
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,015
Got any chocolate milk?

1087
01:01:11,058 --> 01:01:13,626
Sure have, buddy.

1088
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,496
Here ya are.

1089
01:01:14,540 --> 01:01:16,890
Thanks.

1090
01:01:16,934 --> 01:01:19,066
Which apartment?

1091
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:19,937
Straight on back.

1092
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:27,031
Second in the L. Number seven.

1093
01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:29,076
All right.

1094
01:01:29,120 --> 01:01:30,774
Kind of warm today, huh?

1095
01:01:30,817 --> 01:01:32,514
Oh, it's not too bad for
this time of the year.

1096
01:01:38,172 --> 01:01:39,696
Good morning.

1097
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:40,827
Morning.

1098
01:01:40,871 --> 01:01:42,046
You're new on the
route, aren't you?

1099
01:01:42,089 --> 01:01:43,308
Yeah, a substitute.

1100
01:01:43,351 --> 01:01:45,571
What happened to
the other fella?

1101
01:01:45,614 --> 01:01:46,485
Sick.

1102
01:01:46,528 --> 01:01:47,704
Oh, what's the matter with him?

1103
01:01:47,747 --> 01:01:48,356
I don't know.

1104
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:51,229
I catch everything.

1105
01:01:51,272 --> 01:01:53,753
Hear about on the radio,
next morning I got it.

1106
01:01:53,797 --> 01:01:54,972
Too bad.

1107
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:56,625
You aren't very social.

1108
01:01:56,669 --> 01:01:58,540
The regular fella always
stops and talks to me.

1109
01:01:58,584 --> 01:01:59,454
I'm sorry, lady.

1110
01:01:59,498 --> 01:02:01,065
I'm a little late this morning.

1111
01:02:01,108 --> 01:02:04,851
I was hoping maybe
you could help me.

1112
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:07,158
There's something very funny
going on in this court.

1113
01:02:07,201 --> 01:02:07,898
Yeah?

1114
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:09,290
Yeah.

1115
01:02:09,334 --> 01:02:10,465
I was scared to go to
the police with it.

1116
01:02:10,509 --> 01:02:12,772
I thought maybe I
might be poisoned.

1117
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:13,817
What?

1118
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:15,949
Yeah, by the manager.

1119
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:18,038
She's a witch.

1120
01:02:18,082 --> 01:02:18,735
She's a what?

1121
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:19,736
A witch.

1122
01:02:19,779 --> 01:02:22,739
She puts poison in my milk.

1123
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:25,176
Oh, I see.

1124
01:02:25,219 --> 01:02:29,310
Look, switch the bottles
when she isn't looking, see.

1125
01:02:29,354 --> 01:02:30,834
Drink her milk.

1126
01:02:30,877 --> 01:02:32,139
Then you'll be safe, right?

1127
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:05,085
Why, I had a little accident.

1128
01:03:05,129 --> 01:03:06,086
Got a mop?

1129
01:03:06,130 --> 01:03:08,480
I'll clean it up.

1130
01:03:08,523 --> 01:03:09,220
Leave it be.

1131
01:03:09,263 --> 01:03:12,179
I'll clean it up myself.

1132
01:03:12,223 --> 01:03:13,093
OK, mister.

1133
01:03:42,253 --> 01:03:44,864
This place is called
Bellevue Court.

1134
01:03:44,908 --> 01:03:46,779
I drew this from memory,
but it's pretty close.

1135
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:47,736
That's where he's hiding out.

1136
01:03:47,780 --> 01:03:50,391
Right there.

1137
01:03:50,435 --> 01:03:52,219
You sure he's our man, Marty?

1138
01:03:52,263 --> 01:03:53,742
Captain, I couldn't
go on that face.

1139
01:03:53,786 --> 01:03:54,395
He's our man.

1140
01:04:00,749 --> 01:04:03,230
Now there are five
cottages in this area.

1141
01:04:03,274 --> 01:04:06,930
And two, number six and seven in
the "L" at the end of the road.

1142
01:04:06,973 --> 01:04:09,106
Our man lives in number seven.

1143
01:04:09,149 --> 01:04:12,718
His building department plan
will show you the whole layout.

1144
01:04:12,761 --> 01:04:14,241
It's bounded on three
sides by Fuller,

1145
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:16,678
Santa Monica, and [inaudible].

1146
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:18,506
Now, the court is partly
surrounded by a high wall.

1147
01:04:18,550 --> 01:04:21,031
[ringing]

1148
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:23,424
Breen, homicide.

1149
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:24,817
Good.

1150
01:04:24,861 --> 01:04:27,211
You keep your eyes open
until we get there.

1151
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:29,953
Morgan has just gone
into his bungalow alone.

1152
01:04:29,996 --> 01:04:31,258
Any questions?

1153
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:32,694
All right.
You all have your instructions.

1154
01:04:32,738 --> 01:04:33,608
Let's go.

1155
01:06:13,795 --> 01:06:15,319
We're right on time.

1156
01:06:15,362 --> 01:06:18,670
Wait five minutes, go around
and block the side entrance.

1157
01:06:18,713 --> 01:06:19,584
Keep your lights off.

1158
01:09:05,489 --> 01:09:06,142
[barking]

1159
01:10:10,728 --> 01:10:11,903
He's loose.

1160
01:10:11,946 --> 01:10:12,947
I want a radio car in a hurry.

1161
01:10:31,314 --> 01:10:33,881
[sirens]

1162
01:10:41,846 --> 01:10:43,326
WOMAN [ON RADIO]: All units.

1163
01:10:43,369 --> 01:10:45,632
All units in the vicinity
of Santa Monica and Fuller.

1164
01:10:45,676 --> 01:10:50,202
The murder suspect in the
Rawlins killing is at large.

1165
01:10:50,246 --> 01:10:53,074
[crash]

1166
01:10:56,513 --> 01:10:59,994
[gun shots]

1167
01:11:20,058 --> 01:11:22,452
I want a map covering the
storm drain system in this area.

1168
01:11:22,495 --> 01:11:24,367
Get it and meet me at
Venice and Garfield.

1169
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:28,153
Jones, Miller, you stay here
in case he comes up for air.

1170
01:11:28,196 --> 01:11:31,461
I want a man at every other
drain entrance along this line.

1171
01:11:31,504 --> 01:11:33,419
He's got to come up somewhere.

1172
01:11:33,463 --> 01:11:34,377
Come on, Marty.

1173
01:11:34,420 --> 01:11:35,073
You're driving.

1174
01:11:59,706 --> 01:12:01,099
Keep this drain covered.

1175
01:12:01,142 --> 01:12:02,056
He's liable to pop out anywhere.

1176
01:12:25,732 --> 01:12:27,168
Why Venice and
Garfield, Captain?

1177
01:12:27,212 --> 01:12:28,431
It's the main
intersection in the system

1178
01:12:28,474 --> 01:12:29,780
if you're heading
north that way.

1179
01:12:29,823 --> 01:12:31,564
80-K to Control One.

1180
01:12:31,608 --> 01:12:32,739
Air frequency seven.

1181
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:34,393
This is an emergency.

1182
01:12:34,437 --> 01:12:36,264
WOMAN [ON RADIO]: Control One
to all cars on frequency seven,

1183
01:12:36,308 --> 01:12:37,178
stand by.

1184
01:12:37,222 --> 01:12:39,137
Control one to 80-K, go ahead.

1185
01:12:39,180 --> 01:12:40,965
Notify homicide,
send the following

1186
01:12:41,008 --> 01:12:42,836
to Venice and Garfield.

1187
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,623
Four squads, battle lanterns,
gas masks, tear gas.

1188
01:12:46,666 --> 01:12:47,667
Urgent.

1189
01:12:47,711 --> 01:12:49,408
This is a Code Three.

1190
01:12:49,452 --> 01:12:50,453
WOMAN [ON RADIO]: Control
One to 80-K. Rodger.

1191
01:13:13,476 --> 01:13:15,478
And he'll probably head
down this main drain to where

1192
01:13:15,521 --> 01:13:16,740
it comes out at the Rio Hondo.

1193
01:13:16,783 --> 01:13:18,394
Now, you take your squad
and cover that exit.

1194
01:13:18,437 --> 01:13:19,786
Right.

1195
01:13:19,830 --> 01:13:20,700
Keep all spare radio cars
cruising back and forth

1196
01:13:20,744 --> 01:13:21,919
along this main street.

1197
01:13:21,962 --> 01:13:23,529
Watch the curb inlets.

1198
01:13:23,573 --> 01:13:24,530
We'll go in here.

1199
01:13:37,282 --> 01:13:38,196
Any sign of him?

1200
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:39,371
No.

1201
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,416
We've searched every
foot between here

1202
01:13:40,459 --> 01:13:42,200
and the Rio Hondo outlet.

1203
01:13:42,243 --> 01:13:43,810
Then he must be up ahead.

1204
01:13:43,854 --> 01:13:44,463
Let's go.

1205
01:16:23,796 --> 01:16:27,278
[gun shots]

1206
01:17:42,614 --> 01:17:43,223
Yeah, it's done.

1207
01:18:12,513 --> 01:18:15,560
[gun shots]
