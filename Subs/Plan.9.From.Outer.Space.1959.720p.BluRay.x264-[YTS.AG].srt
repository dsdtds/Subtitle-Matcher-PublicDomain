1
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:29,400
Criswell Predicts...

2
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
Greetings, my friend. We are
all interested in the future,

3
00:00:40,900 --> 00:00:45,500
for that is where you and I
are going to spend the
rest of our lives.

4
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:51,300
And remember my friend, future
events such as these will affect
you in the future.

5
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:57,700
You are interested in the
unknown, the mysterious, the unexplainable.

6
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,900
That is why you are here.
And now, for the first time,

7
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:07,900
we are bringing to you the full story of what
happened on that fateful day.

8
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,400
We are giving you all the evidence, based
only on the secret testimonies

9
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:16,100
of the miserable souls who survived

10
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:20,200
this terrifying ordeal. The
incidents, the places,

11
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:26,200
my friend we cannot keep this a secret any longer.
Let us punish the guilty,

12
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:31,700
let us reward the innocent. My friend,

13
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:36,900
can your heart stand the shocking facts
about grave robbers

14
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,900
from outer space?

15
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,500
Plan 9 From Outer Space

16
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,500
All of us on this earth, know that
there is a time to live,

17
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,000
and that there is a time to die,
yet death is always a shock

18
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,900
to those left behind.

19
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:17,900
It is even more of a shock,when death,
the proud brother, comes suddenly without warning.

20
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,700
Just at sundown, a small group,

21
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:25,700
gathered in silent prayer around
the newly-opened grave

22
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,800
of the beloved wife of an elderly man.
Sundown of the day,

23
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:35,000
yet also the sundown of the old man's heart,

24
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,500
for the shadows of grief clouded his very reason.

25
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,000
The funeral over, the saddened group left the graveside.

26
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:23,700
It was when the gravediggers started their task

27
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:27,700
that strange things began to take place.

28
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,900
Fifteen to four.

29
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,800
Yup, right on schedule. There's the
ol' San Fernando Valley

30
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,400
out there now.
-You better radio in

31
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,900
for landing instructions, Danny.
-Right, Jeff.

32
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:46,900
Burbank Tower, this is American
Flight 812, over.

33
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:51,200
Wouldn't surprise
me any if  he's asleep this time of the morning.

34
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:55,400
American Flight 812, this is Burbank Tower.
If I were asleep

35
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,400
you'd never get on the ground !
Your case maybe you'd be up there for good. Over.

36
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,600
You got me that time, Mac.
This American Flight 812 requesting -

37
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:14,200
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

38
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:18,200
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812, over.

39
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:22,300
Holy mackeral.
-Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,

40
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,900
are you in trouble?

41
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,200
-Trouble ?
-Take a look for yourself.

42
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:35,000
-What in the world...
-That's nothing from this world.

43
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,100
Burbank Tower to American Flight 812,
are you in trouble? Are you in trouble?

44
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,100
-Mayday, mayday. Stand by, Burbank Tower.
-Do you suppose the passengers saw it?

45
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:47,000
I doubt it. Most of them are asleep.
But it was quite a jolt, Jeff. I'll check.

46
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,400
Good. We'll get them ready for landing.
Keep it quiet until we get instructions.

47
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,400
-Right.
-American Flight 812 reporting to Burbank Tower, over.

48
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,700
-D'you hear anything ?
-I thought I did.

49
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't like hearin' noises.
'Specially when there ain't s'posed to be any.

50
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,600
-Yeah, sorta spooky-like.

51
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,000
-Maybe we're getting' old.
-Whatever it is it's gone now.

52
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,600
-That's the best thing for us too. Gone.

53
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:38,600
-Yeah, let's go.

54
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:15,300
The grief of his wife's death

55
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:19,300
became greater and greater agony.

56
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:28,200
The home they had so long shared together,
became a tomb.

57
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:33,700
A sweet memory of her joyous living.

58
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:40,300
The sky to which she had once looked,
was now only a covering for her dead body.

59
00:07:55,600 --> 00:08:00,600
The ever-beautiful flowers she had
planted with her own hand,

60
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,900
became nothing more than the
lost roses of her cheeks.

61
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:14,700
Confused by his great loss, the old man

62
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:18,700
left that home,
never to return again.

63
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:36,100
At the funeral of the old man,
unknown to his mourners,

64
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:41,300
his dead wife was watching.

65
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:45,000
-First his wife, then he.
-Tragic.

66
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,400
-Tell me something. Why was his wife buried in the ground,
and

67
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,300
he sealed in a crypt?
-Something to do with family tradition.

68
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,500
A superstition of some sort.

69
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:58,500
Well, it's getting' dark. We'd best be on our way.

70
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,900
Then, as two of his mourners left his final resting place.

71
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:45,200
Minutes later, the police, lead by Inspector Daniel Clay,

72
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,400
arrived at the scene.

73
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:50,600
-Who found him ?
-The man and girl.

74
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:54,600
-Medical, uh, examiner been 'round yet?
-Just left.

75
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,800
The morgue wagon oughta be along most any time.
-You get their

76
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:01,800
statement ?
Yeah, much as we could. They're pretty scared.

77
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:06,400
-Finding a mess like this oughta make anyone frightened.

78
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:10,700
Have one of the boys take the guy
and the girl back to town. You take charge.

79
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,700
-Okay Inspector. What're you gonna do?

80
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,200
-Look around a little.
-Pretty dark out there.

81
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,400
Once you get beyond those lights you won't be
able to see your hand in front of your face.

82
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,500
-I will get one of the flashlights from the patrol car.

83
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:27,500
-You be careful Clay.
-I'm a big boy now, Johnny.

84
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,800
Looks like a bobcat tore through them.

85
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,800
Yeah.

86
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:34,200
Say Lieutenant,

87
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:38,200
d'you get that funny odour ?
-How could I miss it ?

88
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,700
Oh, that'll be the morgue wagon now.

89
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,600
-That's the fifth siren in the last hour.
-Oh, something's happened down at

90
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,600
the cemetery. A lot of police cars and lights.
I stopped but I didn't see anything.

91
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:55,500
Oh well, whatever it is, the morning paper
will carry the whole story.

92
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:05,300
You seem to still be up there somewhere.

93
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,700
Maybe I am.

94
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:11,700
I don't think I've ever seen you
in this mood before.

95
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:17,400
I guess it's because I've never been
in this mood before.

96
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,200
Something about your flight ?

97
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:27,100
Yeah.

98
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,100
What happened, Jeff ?

99
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:39,700
-I saw a flying saucer.
-A saucer ?

100
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,700
You mean the kind from up there ?
-Yeah, or its counterpart.

101
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:48,900
I was shaped like a huge cigar.
Dan [something] saw it too.

102
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:52,900
When it passed over, the whole compartment
lighted up with a blinding glare.

103
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:56,300
Then there was a tremendous wind that practically
knocked us off our course.

104
00:12:56,300 --> 00:13:00,300
-Well did you report it ?
-Yeah, radioed in immediately and they said well

105
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:04,400
keep it quiet until you land.
Then as soon as we landed, big army brass grabbed us

106
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:08,600
and made us swear to
secrecy about the whole thing.

107
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,700
Oh, it burns me up. These things have been seen for years.
They're here, it's a fact.

108
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:16,700
And the public oughta know about it.
-There must be something more you can do about it.

109
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Oh no there isn't.
Oh, but what's the point of making a fuss.

110
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:25,400
Last night I saw a flying object that
couldn't possibly have been from this planet.

111
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:31,100
But I can't say a word. I'm muzzled by army brass!
I can't even admit I saw the thing!

112
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,600
Sounds like Clay's in trouble.

113
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,800
Bet that apparition we saw had
something to do with it.

114
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:48,800
Come on.

115
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,300
-Is he dead ?
-Yeah.

116
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,700
He's messed up as bad as those two back there.

117
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,300
S'pose that saucer or whatever it was
had something to do with this?

118
00:16:24,300 --> 00:16:27,300
Your guess is as good as mine, Larry.

119
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:31,100
But one thing's sure. Inspector Clay is dead...

120
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:35,100
murdered...and somebody's responsible!

121
00:16:35,800 --> 00:16:37,900
You're in charge now, Lieutenant.

122
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,900
-Yeah, guess I am. Kelton.
-Yes Sir ?

123
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:45,900
Get back up to the car and get on the radio.
Tell the coroner he's gotta make another trip out here.

124
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:48,000
Well how 'bout the lab boys ?

125
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,000
Well who do you think we left back at the car,
boy scouts ? Come on, Larry.

126
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:04,800
Greater love hath no man, than to
lay down his life for another.

127
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:08,400
It is always difficult to have last words

128
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,400
over the grave of a friend.
And Inspector Daniel Clay was a friend.

129
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,100
A dear friend to me and to all of us.

130
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:22,700
The bell has rung upon his great career.

131
00:17:23,300 --> 00:17:30,300
Now we lay him to rest. A rest well deserved, but so premature.

132
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,500
People turning south from the freeway
were startled when they saw

133
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:50,500
flying saucers high over Hollywood Boulevard.

134
00:17:57,200 --> 00:18:01,200


135
00:18:04,500 --> 00:18:08,500
A woman, startled by the sight in the
sky, telephones the police.

136
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,200
There comes a time in each man's life,

137
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:39,200
when he can't even believe his own eyes.

138
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Saucers seen over Hollywood!

139
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:51,100
Flying saucers seen over Washington D.C.

140
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,000
The army convoy moved into the field.

141
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,400
Rockets were quickly set up.

142
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:19,100
Colonel Tom Edwards, in charge of saucer field activities,

143
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,300
was to make the greatest decision of his career.

144
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:26,300
He made that decision. Colonel Edwards gave the signal to fire.

145
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,200
Then as swiftly as they had come,
they were gone.

146
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,200
Even to the piercing eye of radar and the speeding jet fighters.

147
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:50,700
-Quite a sight, wasn't it Sir.
-A sight I'd rather not be seeing.

148
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,700
-Are you worried about them Sir ?

149
00:20:52,700 --> 00:20:54,700
Well, they must have a reason for their visits.

150
00:20:54,700 --> 00:21:01,700
Visits? Well that would indicate visitors!
Are big guns the usual way of welcoming visitors?

151
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,900
We haven't always fired at them.

152
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:09,900
For a time we tried to contact them by radio, but no response.

153
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:16,200
Then they attacked a town. A small town, I'll admit.
But nevertheless a town of people.

154
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:20,600
People who died.
-I never heard about that Sir.

155
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,600
Well, it was covered up by the higher echelon. Take any fire,

156
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:29,500
any earthquake, any major disaster,

157
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:32,500
then wonder.
Flying saucers, Captain,

158
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,200
are still a rumour.

159
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:35,700
Officially.

160
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:41,700
Looks like we beat them off again Sir.

161
00:21:41,700 --> 00:21:45,700
What do they want...where are they from...where are they going...

162
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:49,100
They, Sir ? Who ?

163
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:53,400
Oh, this is a training manoeuver, Sir.
We only did a little practice firing at the clouds.

164
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:57,700
Yeah. I wonder what their next move will be.

165
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,300
What will their next move be ?

166
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,700
Your space commander has returned from Earth.

167
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:24,700
Send him in.

168
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,400
You have your report ?

169
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:37,300
We had to pull in here to
Space Station 7 for regeneration.

170
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,300
We're returning to the planet Earth
immediately thereafter.

171
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:45,100
-What progress has been made ?
-We contacted government officials.

172
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,900
They refuse over existence.

173
00:22:48,900 --> 00:22:50,900
What plan will you follow now ?

174
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,900
Plan 9. It's been absolutely impossible to work through these Earth creatures.

175
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,700
Their soul is too controlled.

176
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,200
Plan 9...ah yes. Plan 9 deals

177
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,800
with the resurrection of the dead.

178
00:23:05,800 --> 00:23:09,800
Long-distance electrodes shot into the pinion
pituitary glands of recent dead.

179
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Have you attempted any of this plan as yet ?
-Yes Excellency.

180
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,600
How successful has it been ?

181
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:20,600
We have risen two so far.
We shall be just as successful on more.

182
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:25,600
The living...they have no suspicion of your movements ?

183
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,900
We had to dispose of one policeman.

184
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:32,300
However, none of those risen have been seen.
At least, not by anyone who still remains alive.

185
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:37,500
It's too bad it must be handled this way. However it must.

186
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:42,100
Those who take from the grave will lead the way for our other operations.

187
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,000
Yes, Excellency.
-Continue on. Report to me

188
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,000
in two Earth days.

189
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:54,300
I feared His Excellency wouldn't take our report this well.

190
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:57,600
Well had he been dealing with our own people
his reaction would have been completely different.

191
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,000
He understands the difficulties of the Earth race.

192
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:05,000
What do you think will be the next obstacle
the Earth people will put in our way?

193
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Well, as long as they can think we'll have our problems.

194
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:15,600
But those whom we're using cannot think. They are the dead.
Brought to a simulated life by our electrode guns.

195
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:22,400
You know, it's an interesting think when you consider...the Earth people, who can think,

196
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:26,500
are so frightened by those who cannot: the dead.

197
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:31,500
Well our ship should be regenerated. We better get started.

198
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:29,300
I still think you oughta go in town and stay with your mother until I get back.

199
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:34,400
This is our home and nothing's going to take me from it.

200
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:38,400
Besides, most men try and keep their wives from going home to Momma.

201
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,800
-That's not the point.
-That's all the point there's going to be.

202
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:46,800
Now toddle off and fly your flying machine, Darling.
But if you see any more

203
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:51,500
flying saucers, will you tell them to pick another house to buzz?

204
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:55,800
Don't worry about me.

205
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:59,800
Oh you're the only thing I do worry about. Oh forget about the flying saucers.

206
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:06,300
They're up there. But there's something in that cemetery,

207
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:09,600
and that's too close for comfort.

208
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,500
The saucers are up there. And the cemetery's out there.

209
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:20,100
But I'll be locked up in there. Now off to your wild blue yonders.

210
00:26:20,600 --> 00:26:22,500
You promise you'll lock the doors immediately ?

211
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,500
I promise. Besides, I'll be in bed before half an hour is gone,

212
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:29,800
with your pillow beside me.
-My pillow ?

213
00:26:29,800 --> 00:26:33,800
Well, I have to have something to keep me company while you're away.

214
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:42,900
Sometimes in the night when it does get a little lonely,
I reach over and touch it, then it doesn't seem so lonely anymore.

215
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,100
A crazy kid.

216
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:59,000
I do love you, Darlin'.

217
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:16,200
See you Thursday.
-Goodbye, Honey.

218
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,100
You know I'm not leaving here until you're locked safely inside.

219
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:26,100
All right, Darling.

220
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:39,500
If you're especially nice I may even lock the side door.

221
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:44,000
And be sure you keep the yard lights on.

222
00:28:04,900 --> 00:28:08,300
You're mighty silent this trip, Jeff.

223
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:10,300
You haven't spoken ten words since takeoff.

224
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:13,500
I guess I'm preoccupied, Danny.

225
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:16,600
We've got thirty-three passengers back there that have time to be preoccupied.

226
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:20,100
Flying this flybird doesn't give you that opportunity.

227
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:23,200
I guess you're right, Danny.

228
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:26,400
-Paula ?
-Yeah.

229
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,600
-There's nothing wrong between you two ?
-Oh no, nothing like that.

230
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:33,200
Just that I'm worried, she being there alone and those strange things flying over the house and

231
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:37,600
those incidents in the graveyard the past few days. It's just got me worried.

232
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:42,250
Well, I haven't figured out those crazy skybirds yet but I give you fifty to one odds

233
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:45,100
the police have figured out that cemetery thing by now.

234
00:28:45,100 --> 00:28:48,400
-I hope so.
-If you're really that worried Jeff why don't you radio in and find out?

235
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,400
Mac should be on duty at the field by now.
He could call Paula and relay the message to you.

236
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:58,200
-Hi Edith.
-Hi Silents. I haven't heard a word from this end of the plane since we left the field.

237
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:01,800
Jeff's been giving me himself and me a study in silence.

238
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,000
-You boys are'nt feudin'?
-Oh no Edie, nothing like that.

239
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,700
Hey Edie, how about you and me balling it up in Albuquerque ?

240
00:29:07,700 --> 00:29:11,300
Albuquerque ? Have you read that flight schedule Boy ?
-What about it ?

241
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,300
We land in Albuquerque at 4 am. That's strictly a nine o'clock town.

242
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:17,800
Well I know a friend that'll help us --

243
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,200
-Let's have a problem first, huh Danny. 
-Ah he's worried about Paula.

244
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:26,200
I read about that cemetery business.
I tried to get you kids to not buy too near one of those things.

245
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,900
He thought it'd be quiet and peaceful there.

246
00:29:30,900 --> 00:29:34,300
No doubt about that.
It's quiet alright, like a tomb.

247
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,800
I'm sorry Jeff, that was a bad joke.

248
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:41,300
Say., I almost forgot what I came in here for.
How's the coffee situation?

249
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:44,400
-Mmmm that's for me.
-That sure wouldn't hurt anything, Edie.

250
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:48,400
Okay, I'll be right back. And say Jeff, make that call to your wife.

251
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:52,900
Huh, not only will she throw water on my Albuquerque plan but now she's
repeating herself.

252
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:57,100
-How 'bout that Albuquerque ball ?
-I can't resist your charm, Danny Boy.

253
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:08,300
Residents near the cemetery paid little attention to the blast of thunder

254
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:11,100
and the flash of lightning.

255
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:15,900
But from the blast, arose the moving figure of the dead old man.

256
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:48,300
Hello ? Who ?

257
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,400
Mac ? Well, hi Mac !

258
00:30:52,800 --> 00:30:54,800
Sure I'm all right.

259
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,800
I just fell asleep.

260
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:02,400
Tell Jeff I'm all right.

261
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,400
Okay Mac. Thanks for calling. Goodnight.

262
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,000
Mrs. Trent ! Mrs. Trent ! What's wrong ?

263
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:49,100
They'll be at the hatch in a moment.
You can open it now, Tanna.

264
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:14,200
Turn off the electrodes quickly.
They can't tell us from anyone else.

265
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:42,000
It's tough to find something when you don't know what you're looking for.

266
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:46,000
-I don't think the Lieutenant does either.
-Then what're doing out here? I was off duty an hour ago.

267
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,400
Ah don't ask me any questions. I'm just a hardhand just like you.

268
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:00,400
What do you suppose that noise was?

269
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:04,300
Whatever it was it's no more strange than the other things happening around this cemetery.

270
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:07,700
Spirits like Old Farmer Caulder talked about.

271
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,700
-Heh. Maybe.
-The only spirits he saw tonight were those I smelled on his breath.

272
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:15,700
Well don't forget Mrs. Trent claims to have seen them too.
She didn't have anything on her breath.

273
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:19,700
-She was hysterical.
-Well true, she was frightened, and in a state of shock.

274
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:24,200
But, don't forget that torn nightgown and the scratched feet.

275
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:31,700
Yeah I hadn't thought of that.
I guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant

276
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:34,400
and I'm still a uniformed cop.

277
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,800
Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry. In the meantime let's get-

278
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,700
-Lieutenant, Lieutenant ! Did you hear that ?
-How could we help it ?

279
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,600
-It sure was strange.
-Know what it was ?

280
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:45,000
-No more than you do.
-If it weren't for orders I'd get out of here right now.

281
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:47,400
-It was a saucer.
-A flying saucer ? What makes you say that ?

282
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:50,000
You remember the noise we heard the other night ?

283
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:52,500
We were knocked to the ground, how could I forget ?

284
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:56,300
Exactly, but you're not remembering that sound.

285
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:01,300
There you're wrong, Lieutenant.
I'm with a fact the sound is similar, but what about the blinding light?

286
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:06,000
Well haven't you heard ?
Many times a saucer hasn't had a glow,

287
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:10,500
or a light of any kind for that matter.
-That proves it. What next Lietenant ?

288
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:17,200
Maybe this doesn't mean much,
but uh Jamie and me found a grave that looks like it's been busting into.

289
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:18,800
-What ? Where ?
-Why uh why...

290
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:22,300
-Come on man out with it, we haven't got all day to waste.

291
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:26,300
-Uh, just over there beyond the crypt.
-All right, show us the way !

292
00:39:28,200 --> 00:39:32,200
Look, here it is Lieutenant.

293
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:37,400
Ah it's been broken into all right.

294
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,400
Strange. If someone had broken in, the dirt should be piled up here somewhere.

295
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:47,300
It looks like it's fallen in into the grave.
-Larry you'll be out of that uniform before you know it.

296
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:52,500
-Do we have the right to look down there Lieutenant ?
-Ah, technically no.

297
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:58,300
Well, this spot looks familiar, though.
We shouldn't investigate any further without the permission of  next of kin.

298
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,100
Let's go get it !

299
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:04,100
-How ?
-I see what you mean, the gravestone's down there.

300
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:06,900
Well, let's go down and find out who's grave it is.

301
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:10,700
-How ?
-By going down and finding out !

302
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:14,700
-Are you sure you mean that Lieutenant ?
-If I didn't mean it I wouldn't have said it.

303
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:18,800
-Scared ?
-Well, why do I always get hooked up with these spook details?

304
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,800
Monsters, graves, bodies,...

305
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,800
oooh all right.

306
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,500
Casket's here, but nobody's in it.

307
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:40,300
Can you read the name on the casket?

308
00:40:40,300 --> 00:40:43,600
It's too dark. Give me a flashlight.

309
00:40:43,600 --> 00:40:47,600
-How 'bout a match ?
-We sure could try it. Let me have them !

310
00:40:57,700 --> 00:41:01,700
It's Inspector Clay's grave !
Be he ain't in it!

311
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:11,600
But meanwhile, in the Pentagon, in Washington DC...

312
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:21,200
Try G2...

313
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:23,800
...come in !

314
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:27,800
Yes of course, I'll keep in touch.

315
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:35,200
Come in, Colonel Edwards. Close the door. At ease, Colonel.

316
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:38,900
-Thank you, Sir.
-Sit down.

317
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:46,400
I understand, Colonel, you've been on tap for many of our saucer attacks.

318
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:51,000
I'm in charge of field operations, Sir.

319
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:55,000
You believe there are such things as flying saucers, Colonel ?

320
00:41:55,300 --> 00:41:57,500
-Yessir.
-You've seen them ?

321
00:41:57,500 --> 00:41:59,300
Yessir.

322
00:41:59,300 --> 00:42:03,900
You realize there's a government directive
stating that there is no such thing as a flying saucer?

323
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:06,900
Yessir.

324
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:10,200
Do you stand by your statement that you've seen flying saucers ?

325
00:42:10,200 --> 00:42:13,600
Well, uh...

326
00:42:13,600 --> 00:42:16,400
yessir.

327
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:20,400
This could mean a court marshall. Admitting this against direct orders.

328
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,900
General Roberts, may I speak freely ?

329
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:27,900
-You may.
How could I hope to hold down my command

330
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:31,900
if I didn't believe in what I saw and shot at?

331
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:37,900
-I, uh, like you Colonel.
-Thank you, Sir.

332
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,700
There are flying saucers.

333
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:48,000
There's no doubt they are in our skies.
They've been there for some time.

334
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:50,700
What're we going to do about them ?

335
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:54,400
-Who knows ?
-Then, uh, they really are there ?

336
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:58,400
-I thought you were convinced of that !
-I am.

337
00:42:58,600 --> 00:43:00,800
We've had contact with them.

338
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,700
-Contact ? How ?
-Radio.

339
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:06,800
-They speak our language ?
-Well not quite.

340
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:12,100
We  received messages from their space ships.
For a while it came in as just a lot of jumbled noise.

341
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,000
And now, Sir ?

342
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,900
Well since they first uh tried contact with us by radio,
we've developed a language computer.

343
00:43:20,900 --> 00:43:24,800
A machine that breaks down any language to our own.

344
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:28,800
General, uh,  what's this all got to do with me?

345
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,300
Well you've been in charge of saucer field activity for a long while.

346
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:37,200
I think it's about time you heard these recordings. Do you mind?

347
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:41,200
Mind ? Huh, I'm anxious !

348
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:51,400
This is Eros, a space soldier from a planet of your galaxy.

349
00:43:52,500 --> 00:43:57,700
I fully realize our language differences,
however I also know you finally have

350
00:43:57,800 --> 00:44:05,800
perfected the dictorobitary, or as you on Earth put it,
the language computer. So you can now understand that which I speak.

351
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:11,000
Since the beginning of your time, we have been far beyond your planet.

352
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:17,300
It has taken you centuries to even grasp what we developed eons of your years ago.

353
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,700
Do you still believe it impossible we exist?
You didn't actually think you were the only inhabited planet in the universe?

354
00:44:25,700 --> 00:44:28,400
How can any race be so stupid ?

355
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:34,200
Permit me to set your mind at ease.
We do not want to conquer your planet. Only save it.

356
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,200
We could have destroyed it long ago, if that had been our aim.

357
00:44:40,300 --> 00:44:45,800
Our principal purpose is friendly.
I admit, we have had to take certain means which you might

358
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:48,000
refer to as criminal,

359
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:52,000
but that is because of your big guns
which have destroyed some of our representatives.

360
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:59,800
If you persist in denying us our landings,
then we must only accept that you do not want us on friendly terms.

361
00:45:01,900 --> 00:45:06,300
We then have no alternative but to destroy you before you destroy us.

362
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:15,000
With your ancient, juvenile minds, you have developed explosives too fast for your minds to conceive what you were doing.

363
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:19,300
You are on the verge of destroying the entire universe.

364
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,600
We are part of that universe.

365
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:22,600
This is our last -

366
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:33,100
That's the end of that one.
Atmospheric conditions in outer space often interfere with transmitting.

367
00:45:33,800 --> 00:45:36,300
How many of these recordings do you have General ?

368
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:40,300
An even dozen up to now. This was the last one.
We received it over a month ago.

369
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:44,600
-Do you think they mean business ?
-We can't afford to take any chances.

370
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,400
Come over here. You ever been to Hollywood ?

371
00:45:50,500 --> 00:45:54,400
-Oh a couple of times. A few years ago.
-You're going to be there in the morning.

372
00:45:54,400 --> 00:46:00,400
Just a few minutes from Hollywood, in the town of San Fernando, reports have come in

373
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:04,400
of saucers flying so low the exhaust  knocked people to the ground.

374
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:09,200
There have even been stated claims of saucer landings.

375
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:13,400
Major Carlson will replace you while you're out there.

376
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:16,700
You're the best man for the job of attempting to contact them.

377
00:46:16,700 --> 00:46:20,500
Find them, Colonel. See what in hell it is they want!

378
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:21,500
All right, Sir.

379
00:46:27,400 --> 00:46:31,000
These are confidential reports, Colonel.
Read them over carefully on the plane,

380
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:36,000
turn them over to intelligence when you get to Los Angeles.
They'll have further orders for disposition.

381
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:37,800
Yessir.

382
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:43,000
-Colonel Edwards ?
-Yessir ?

383
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:44,000
-Good luck.
-Thank you, Sir.

384
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,000
We are ready to report, Excellency.

385
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,000
-You are many days late.
-It was unavoidable.

386
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:24,000
We tried to transmit via televisor, but atmospheric
conditions made transmission impossible.

387
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:29,000
-You should have transmitted as soon as conditions permitted.
-I thought time was of the essence.

388
00:47:29,800 --> 00:47:33,800
Suspicion  has fallen upon our movements.
Our ships have been viewed near the point of operations.

389
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:38,000
And what has this extra time gained, Eros?

390
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:42,000
We have successfully risen three of the dead ones.

391
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,100
-Permit me to see one.
-Bring in the big one.

392
00:47:45,100 --> 00:47:49,100
Use your small electrode gun.

393
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,300
I have taken two ships from your command.

394
00:47:54,300 --> 00:47:57,800
But...that will leave only my ship !

395
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,800
It is necessary that you continue your mission alone.

396
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:05,700
I have need of your other ships elsewhere.

397
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:10,700
Even though you have risen three of the Earth dead,
the plan is far from successful,

398
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:16,000
and you Eros, must prove it an operational success before
more time,

399
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,000
energy, and ships, may be spent on it.

400
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:25,300
We will not fail. Everything is on our side.

401
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:29,600
Not everything !
You do not have the live Earth people !

402
00:48:34,700 --> 00:48:39,000
You report that your ship was viewed at scene of your present operations ?

403
00:48:39,100 --> 00:48:40,400
That is correct.

404
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:45,400
They have been viewed many times, but not at the scene of operations.

405
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:46,700
Something must be done about that.

406
00:48:54,900 --> 00:48:58,900
Stop him Tanna ! He's close enough ! Turn off your electrode gun !

407
00:48:59,100 --> 00:49:03,100
No ! No ! Stop him Tanna !

408
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:06,600
I can't get it, it's jammed !
-Stop him you fool !

409
00:49:06,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Drop the gun to the floor, Tanna !
The metal will break contact!

410
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:19,600
[Gasping] That was too close !

411
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:20,600
Yes.

412
00:49:25,300 --> 00:49:28,300
Bring the giant here that I may get a better look at him.

413
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:46,100
Yes, he's a fine specimen.
Are they all this powerful on planet Earth ?

414
00:49:46,500 --> 00:49:49,300
This one is an exception, Excellency.

415
00:49:49,300 --> 00:49:53,300
-What are the other two like ?
-One is a woman, the other an old man.

416
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:57,300
-An old man, you say ?
-Yes, Excellency.

417
00:50:01,100 --> 00:50:05,000
This gives me a plan. Put the big one away.

418
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,000
Pick up your electrode gun.
Make sure it's in working order before pointing it at him.

419
00:50:09,900 --> 00:50:12,200
Whatever made it jam must have been cleared by the fall.

420
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,400
Take him back to the ship.

421
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:33,700
The old one must be sacrificed. Re-land on Earth.
Send the old one to enter a dwelling.

422
00:50:34,900 --> 00:50:38,900
Then cut off the electrokinetic and turn on your ship's decomposure ray.

423
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:49,000
The result will astound those watching. Astound them enough to delay their attention until you have gained your other recruits from the cemetery.

424
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:53,400
Yes, Excellency. It'll be done.

425
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:54,400
Report to me when this has been accomplished.

426
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:07,700
Eros, the Earth people are getting to that which we fear.

427
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:11,600
Since they will not listen or respect our existence,

428
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:15,600
they cannot help but believe our powers when they see their own dead walking 'round again,

429
00:51:15,900 --> 00:51:20,900
brought about by our advancement in such things. As soon as you have enough of the dead recruits,

430
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:30,400
march them on the capitals of the Earth, let nothing stand in your way. Their own dead will be used to make them accept our existence, and believe in that fact.

431
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:17,500
Mr. and Mrs. Trent...this is Colonel Edwards from Washington DC.

432
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:19,900
-Good evening, Colonel.
-Hello Colonel.

433
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:22,100
Colonel would like to ask you a few questions.

434
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,100
-Questions ? What about, Colonel ?
-May I, uh, sit down ?

435
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,000
Oh, I'm sorry, please do.

436
00:52:29,000 --> 00:52:33,000
I want to ask you about your strange experience the other night, when you saw the flying saucer.

437
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:40,200
After that the police brought me home.

438
00:52:40,200 --> 00:52:43,600
I hope I never see such a sight again.

439
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:47,000
Well after your description I don't think I'd want to see it either.

440
00:52:47,000 --> 00:52:51,000
One thing
more...after you were forced to the ground by that blast of wind,

441
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:56,800
was it a hot or cold blast?
-It's kind of hard to explain.

442
00:52:56,800 --> 00:53:02,900
It wasn't hot, wasn't cold, it was just a terrific force. We-we couldn't get off the ground.

443
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:07,200
The light blinded me so badly I couldn't see a thing.

444
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:12,700
We could only feel the pressure of the wind, until it was gone.
When the glare left us,

445
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:16,100
we could see a glowing ball disappearing off in the distance.

446
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:17,700
-Which way ?
-Toward the cemetery.

447
00:53:34,500 --> 00:53:38,100
This is the most fantastic story I've ever heard.

448
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,000
And every word of it's true, too.

449
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,400
That's the fantastic part of it.

450
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,400
We found a lot of suspicious things out in that cemetery.

451
00:53:46,700 --> 00:53:50,700
Then again, didn't find anything to base a fact or suspicion on.

452
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:56,200
Hey, do you hear anything.

453
00:54:02,100 --> 00:54:04,600
You see anything out there Kelton ?

454
00:54:04,600 --> 00:54:08,400
Too dark, Lieutenant.

455
00:54:08,400 --> 00:54:12,400
But something's started stinking awful bad.

456
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:22,900
There's something out there.

457
00:55:50,100 --> 00:55:54,300
-What do you make of that ?
-You got me ! It didn't look that way a minute ago.

458
00:55:55,800 --> 00:55:58,800
-What about your man ?
-Oh, in the excitement I forgot all about Kelton.

459
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,300
Oh, he'll be all right in a few minutes.

460
00:56:11,100 --> 00:56:14,200
-Did you see that thing ? Did you get it ?
-We got it.

461
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,100
What was it ? It didn't fall...I fired every bullet I had.

462
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:23,600
So did I. I don't know what it was or what happened, but unless that bag of bones

463
00:56:23,700 --> 00:56:27,200
can reassemble itself, it's out of the running now.

464
00:56:38,400 --> 00:56:42,000
Colonel I've been out here so often you'd think I'd taken a lease on this place.

465
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:44,000
Not a long lease, I hope.

466
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:48,000
I see what you mean. But you know, I can't help but feel the answer's out here
somewhere.

467
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:51,000
Is the uh girl safe ?

468
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:56,300
Mrs. Trent you'd better stay with the car.
-Stay here alone? Not on your life.

469
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,000
-Modern women...
-Yeah, they been that way all down through the ages.

470
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,700
Especially in a spot like this.

471
00:57:03,700 --> 00:57:05,800
-Kelton ! -Yessir ?
-Stay with Mrs. Trent.

472
00:57:05,800 --> 00:57:06,800
All right, Lieutenant.

473
00:57:07,500 --> 00:57:10,500
-Now you stay close to the officer, Honey.
-I'd feel safer with you.

474
00:57:15,500 --> 00:57:20,100
-Now the Lieutenant knows best.
-Oh I don't like it, but I guess there isn't much I can do about it.

475
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:30,300
-You have a gun ?
-No.

476
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,300
Know how to use one ?

477
00:57:32,700 --> 00:57:34,300
After four years in the Marine Corps ?

478
00:57:37,800 --> 00:57:39,100
-Here.
-You think we'll need these ?

479
00:57:39,100 --> 00:57:40,900
You can never tell. Let's get going.

480
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,700
-What do you expect to find out here ?
-Well there's only one answer to that Mr. Trent,

481
00:58:05,700 --> 00:58:10,100
we'll know when we find it. Inspector Clay's grave is right over here.

482
00:58:10,700 --> 00:58:13,900
-Is that the one you told me was broken into ?
-Yes.

483
00:58:31,700 --> 00:58:33,400
-This it ?
-Yeah.

484
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:36,100
Looks to me like someone had broken out instead of in.

485
00:58:36,100 --> 00:58:43,000
-I figured that, but that's impossible ! -I wonder.
-Look, Colonel, some things just can't happen.

486
00:58:43,100 --> 00:58:49,700
Yeah well after that apparition that was draped across Mr. Trent's patio, I would say we should keep our minds open to anything.

487
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:53,800
Look, Colonel, I'm a policeman. I've got to deal in facts.

488
00:58:53,800 --> 00:59:01,400
But, I guess I'll have to go along with you.  You know I bet my badge right now we haven't seen the last of those weirdies.

489
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:10,300
-They'll discover our ship soon.
-You going to let them find us ?

490
00:59:10,300 --> 00:59:14,300
It's the only way. These are the same men who have been so close so often.

491
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:17,600
They must be halted before they can inform others about us.

492
00:59:17,600 --> 00:59:19,600
-But there were others in the car !
-They'll be taken too.

493
00:59:23,900 --> 00:59:27,900
Send the big one to get the girl and the policeman. I'll turn on the dictorobitary so we may converse with them.

494
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:03,000
You know, maybe we're barking up the wrong tree.

495
01:00:03,000 --> 01:00:06,000
One thing a policeman learns, Mr. Trent, is patience.

496
01:00:06,000 --> 01:00:10,000
-Where the burn spot you mentioned.
-Right over the - look!

497
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:21,700
We'll investigate, but move carefully.

498
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:11,900
A moment or two more, and you will be the first live Earth people

499
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,100
ever to enter a celestial ship.

500
01:01:15,500 --> 01:01:19,500
Wow...boy,  how could anything that big hide for so long a time ?

501
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:24,800
Never heard metal sound like that before.

502
01:01:24,800 --> 01:01:28,800
-What do you see ?
-Only my reflection. Must be some kind of one-way glass.

503
01:01:29,500 --> 01:01:33,500
-How do you get into this thing ?
-I'm not sure I want to find out.

504
01:01:46,100 --> 01:01:47,100
They're just outside.

505
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:54,600
You can open the outer hatch now.

506
01:02:11,400 --> 01:02:14,500
-You goin' in that thing ?
-That's what we're here for.

507
01:02:14,500 --> 01:02:19,500
-I don't know, the way these things speed around we might just get in there and pft! Off it goes.
-That's a chance we take.

508
01:02:21,100 --> 01:02:26,500
Well, I took a chance on those earlier airplanes. Might just as well see what the inside of one of these looks like. Got your guns ready ?

509
01:02:26,700 --> 01:02:32,500
-I tell you one thing, if a little green man jumps out at me I'm shooting first and asking questions later.

510
01:02:41,700 --> 01:02:43,200
They're in the outer chamber now.

511
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:49,200
Eros, do we have to kill them ?

512
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:54,600
-Yes.
-It seems such a waste.

513
01:02:55,200 --> 01:03:00,200
Well wouldn't it be better to kill a few now than, with their meddling, permit
them  to destroy the entire universe ?

514
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:05,500
-You're always right, Eros.
-Of course.

515
01:03:05,500 --> 01:03:09,500
But those are not my words, those are the words of the Ruler.

516
01:03:16,300 --> 01:03:17,300
Now you two stay right where you're at.

517
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:30,300
We will do as you command. For the moment.
-No for the moment about it. You just do as I tell you.

518
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:42,000
You do not need guns.
-Maybe we think we do.

519
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:46,300
They would be of no use to you now.
-They've been mighty useful before on flesh and blood,

520
01:03:47,100 --> 01:03:50,100
and you two look like you've got a lot of both.

521
01:03:52,600 --> 01:03:57,600
True, they would be effective upon us. If you were to have the opportunity to use them...

522
01:03:58,100 --> 01:04:02,900
Mister, if you don't get away from that control board I'll show you just how
effective they can be.

523
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:10,900
Shall we talk now, or wait ? Your friends will be here shortly.

524
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:14,500
-What friends ?
-Those you left at the vehicle.

525
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:18,500
-If you've done anything to Paula...
-Take it easy Mr. Trent.

526
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:22,500
Oh I assure you, no harm has come to her. Would you like to see?

527
01:04:25,000 --> 01:04:29,000
Next time you try that I won't aim at the board.
-You're a headstrong young man.

528
01:04:29,300 --> 01:04:32,600
I was only going to turn on the televisor so you could see her movements.

529
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:40,300
Go ahead, my friend, but move very carefully.

530
01:04:54,800 --> 01:04:56,500
She's only fainted.

531
01:04:57,500 --> 01:05:01,300
-You fiend !
-I ? A fiend ? ...

532
01:05:01,300 --> 01:05:05,000
I am a soldier of our planet !

533
01:05:06,700 --> 01:05:12,500
I ? A fiend ? We did not come here as enemies.

534
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:17,300
We came only with friendly intentions. To talk.

535
01:05:17,300 --> 01:05:18,900
To ask your aid.

536
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,500
-Our aid ?
-Yes.

537
01:05:21,500 --> 01:05:27,900
Your aid for the whole universe. But your governments of Earth refused even to accept our existence.

538
01:05:28,300 --> 01:05:34,300
Even though you've seen us, heard our messages, you still refused to accept us.

539
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:38,900
Why is it so important that you want to contact the governments of our Earth ?

540
01:05:38,900 --> 01:05:43,100
Because of death. Because all you of Earth are idiots !

541
01:05:44,600 --> 01:05:48,200
-Now you just hold on, Buster.
-No you hold on.

542
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:52,900
First was your firecracker, a harmless explosive. Then your handgrenade.

543
01:05:53,600 --> 01:06:00,600
They began to kill your own people a few at a time. Then the bomb, then a larger bomb.

544
01:06:00,700 --> 01:06:05,500
Many people are killed at one time. Then your scientists

545
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:09,600
stumbled upon the atom bomb. Split the atom.

546
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:14,000
Then the hydrogen bomb, where you actually explode the air itself.

547
01:06:15,700 --> 01:06:20,700
Now you [audio jump] brings the destruction of the entire universe, served by our sun.

548
01:06:22,600 --> 01:06:26,600
The only explosion left is the solaronite.

549
01:06:27,300 --> 01:06:30,600
-Why there's no such thing.
-Perhaps to you.

550
01:06:30,600 --> 01:06:35,600
But we've known it for centuries. Your scientists will stumble upon it as they have all the others.

551
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:43,000
But the juvenile minds you possess will not comprehend its strength, until it's too late.

552
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:46,800
You're way above our heads.

553
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:50,800
The solaronite is a way to explode the actual particles of sunlight.

554
01:06:51,400 --> 01:06:53,700
Why that's impossible.

555
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,700
Even now, your scientists are working on a way to harness the sun's rays.

556
01:06:58,100 --> 01:07:01,000
The rays of sunlight are minute particles.

557
01:07:01,000 --> 01:07:05,000
Is it so far from your imagination they cannot do as I have suggested?

558
01:07:05,000 --> 01:07:08,300
Why a particle of sunlight can't even be seen or measured.

559
01:07:08,300 --> 01:07:12,300
Can you see or measure an atom ? Yet you can explode one.

560
01:07:13,300 --> 01:07:16,200
A ray of sunlight is made up many atoms.

561
01:07:16,200 --> 01:07:20,200
So what if we do developed this solaronite bomb ? We'd be even a stronger nation than now.

562
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:26,700
Stronger. You see ? You see ? Your stupid minds...stupid ! Stupid !!

563
01:07:26,900 --> 01:07:28,900
-That's all I'm taking from you !
-Get back here you jerk !

564
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:31,700
Let him finish.

565
01:07:39,700 --> 01:07:43,000
It's because of men like you that all must be destroyed.

566
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,000
Headstrong, violent ! No use of the mind God gave you.

567
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,500
You talk of God ?

568
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:55,500
You also think it impossible that we, too, might think of God ?

569
01:07:58,500 --> 01:08:05,500
You,  who wear the uniform of your country. You see, I wear the uniform of my country.

570
01:08:06,600 --> 01:08:12,600
Yes, we've had to use drastic means to get to you, but you left us no alternative.

571
01:08:13,200 --> 01:08:20,200
When you have the solaronite, you have nothing. Nor, does the universe.

572
01:08:21,500 --> 01:08:25,500
You speak of solaronite, but just what is it ?

573
01:08:26,400 --> 01:08:32,400
Take a can of your gasoline. Say this can of gasoline is the sun.

574
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:38,600
Now you spread a thin a line of it to a ball, representing the Earth.

575
01:08:40,600 --> 01:08:44,600
Now, the gasoline represents the sunlight, the sun particles.

576
01:08:45,700 --> 01:08:49,700
Here we saturate the ball with the gasoline, the sunlight.

577
01:08:51,000 --> 01:08:55,000
Then we put a flame to the ball. The flame will speedily travel around the Earth,

578
01:08:55,900 --> 01:08:58,600
back along the line of gasoline to can,

579
01:08:58,600 --> 01:09:06,600
or the sun itself. It will explode this source, and spread to every place that gasoline, or sunlight, touches.

580
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:13,600
Explode the sunlight here, Gentlemen, and you explode the universe.

581
01:09:15,300 --> 01:09:21,300
Explode the sunlight here, and a chain reaction will occur, direct to the sun itself.

582
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,600
And to all the planets that sunlight touches.

583
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,600
To every planet in the universe. This why you must be stopped.

584
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:36,000
This is why any means must be used to stop you.

585
01:09:36,300 --> 01:09:41,300
In a friendly manner, or as it seems, you want it.

586
01:09:42,400 --> 01:09:47,400
-He's mad.
-Mad ? Is it mad that you destroy other people to save yourselves ?

587
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:49,800
You have done this.

588
01:09:49,800 --> 01:09:53,800
Is it mad that one country must destroy another to save themselves ?

589
01:09:53,800 --> 01:09:57,800
You have also done this. How then is it mad that one planet

590
01:09:58,100 --> 01:10:02,100
must destroy another that threatens the very existence-
-That's enough !!

591
01:10:04,500 --> 01:10:08,500
In my land, women are for advancing the race, not for fighting

592
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:13,800
man's battles. Life is not so expansive on my planet.

593
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:19,600
We don't cling to it like you do. Our entire aim is for the development of our planet.

594
01:10:38,100 --> 01:10:40,300
-What happened to you ?
-How come you're all alone ?

595
01:10:40,300 --> 01:10:44,300
I asked for lots of help !
-You sounded drunk or something on the radio.

596
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:47,300
-If I didn't see it with my own eyes I would never have believed it !
-Believed what ?

597
01:10:48,400 --> 01:10:50,800
It was horrible ! And he almost broke my shoulder !

598
01:10:50,800 --> 01:10:55,800
Look, what are you trying to say ? If you don't make sense we'll never get to the bottom of this. Now who slugged you ?

599
01:10:56,600 --> 01:10:58,300
Inspector Clay.

600
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:02,300
-What ?
-It was Clay all right, only not like we remembered him.

601
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,400
Well his grave was busted into, wasn't it ?

602
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:08,600
Next you'll tell me you saw skeletons.

603
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:12,600
-We did, earlier.
-Now I know you're off your rocker.

604
01:11:12,800 --> 01:11:16,100
All of us saw, the Lieutenant, the Colonel, everybody!

605
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:18,900
-Where's the Lieutenant now ?
-We've gotta find them.

606
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:24,500
Mrs. Trent is gone! I was left here to guard her. Then Clay showed up and put me out of the running.

607
01:11:24,600 --> 01:11:27,500
And the second time tonight and I'm getting darned tired of it !

608
01:11:27,500 --> 01:11:29,900
-Which way were they going ?
-Oh, that way.

609
01:11:29,900 --> 01:11:30,900
Come on !

610
01:11:38,200 --> 01:11:43,000
Then one day it could all be gone, in one big puff of smoke

611
01:11:43,200 --> 01:11:47,200
and ball of fire. All that out there,

612
01:11:48,000 --> 01:11:51,500
the stars, the planets,

613
01:11:51,500 --> 01:11:54,600
all just an empty void.

614
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:57,300
You two had better come along with us.

615
01:11:57,300 --> 01:12:01,300
-Come with you ? Where ?
-The police station.

616
01:12:03,800 --> 01:12:07,800
So it seems you think you have the upper hand.

617
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:09,100
Look out there.

618
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,200
Jeff.

619
01:12:26,900 --> 01:12:30,900
She is unharmed, but he would kill in seconds if I so choose.

620
01:12:40,900 --> 01:12:41,900
Holy cow!

621
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:51,000
Look there.

622
01:12:55,400 --> 01:12:59,400
It's Clay all right, there's no mistaking that.
-And he's got Mrs. Trent !

623
01:13:00,100 --> 01:13:04,100
-Get your gun ready.
-From all I've seen tonight guns won't do any good.

624
01:13:04,200 --> 01:13:08,500
Clay is dead, and we buried him. How are we going to kill somebody that's already dead ?

625
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:14,200
Dead ! And yet there he stands ! That other one earlier I emptied a full clip into him.

626
01:13:14,300 --> 01:13:18,300
I'm seeing it, that's the only reason I'm listening to you.

627
01:13:21,600 --> 01:13:25,600
Look, I've got an idea. Hurt him or not, we've got to try something.

628
01:13:25,700 --> 01:13:30,000
I'm going to sneak up behind him and whop him over the head. That oughta make him move.

629
01:13:30,300 --> 01:13:34,400
Follow me. Even when Clay was alive he couldn't run fast enough to catch me,

630
01:13:34,600 --> 01:13:38,700
so when he does, you grab Mrs. Trent and run like lightning in the opposite direction.

631
01:13:39,200 --> 01:13:42,200
-Oh, you think it will work ?
-Know anything else to try ?

632
01:13:59,300 --> 01:14:04,300
Oh, I'll be all right. Take care of the others.

633
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:08,900
Your men have felled the big one.

634
01:14:08,900 --> 01:14:12,600
This could only happen because the electrode ray is off.

635
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:14,600
He'll walk again when I turn it on.

636
01:14:14,600 --> 01:14:16,300
Hold it, right there.

637
01:14:16,300 --> 01:14:21,300
-Suppose the Lieutenant and the others are in that thing !
-Well suppose there are martians or something in there !

638
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:31,700
Come on, let's go.

639
01:14:34,700 --> 01:14:36,300
Open up in there, open up !

640
01:14:41,300 --> 01:14:44,200
-Get that door open.
-Colonel I wouldn't know one switch from another.

641
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:02,400
Hold on Eros, I'll have the ship in the air in a minute !

642
01:15:24,800 --> 01:15:27,300
Get out of here, Jeff ! The ship's on fire !

643
01:15:47,500 --> 01:15:49,600
Eros !

644
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:53,600
Eros everything's on fire ! Hurry, wake up Eros ! Eros, Eros, wake up, wake up !

645
01:16:00,700 --> 01:16:04,700
Eros! Eros wake up, Eros! God wake up!

646
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,100
Oh, I wonder if that's the last we'll see of them ?

647
01:16:26,100 --> 01:16:29,000
Perhaps, but sooner or later there'll be other.

648
01:16:29,000 --> 01:16:33,000
Look !

649
01:16:35,100 --> 01:16:38,800
Have they caught that woman, that thing yet ?

650
01:16:38,800 --> 01:16:41,300
Hey that's right, there's another ghoul running loose.

651
01:16:41,300 --> 01:16:43,700
And it's my guess that she'll look like him.

652
01:16:43,700 --> 01:16:47,700
With the ship and the ray gun gone, they have no control.

653
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:52,600
We got to hand it to them though, they're far ahead from us.

654
01:16:57,200 --> 01:17:01,200
Fire ! Eros ! Aaaaaaaaah !

655
01:17:07,400 --> 01:17:11,400
My friend, you have seen this incident based on sworn testimony.

656
01:17:12,500 --> 01:17:15,500
Can you prove that it didn't happen ?

657
01:17:15,500 --> 01:17:19,500
Perhaps on your way home, you will pass someone in the dark,

658
01:17:19,700 --> 01:17:23,700
and you will never know it, for they will be from outer space.

659
01:17:25,400 --> 01:17:29,400
Many scientists believe that another world is watching us this moment.

660
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:33,000
We once laughed at the horseless carriage,

661
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:37,000
the aeroplane, the telephone, the electric light, vitamins,

662
01:17:38,000 --> 01:17:40,700
radio, and even television !

663
01:17:40,700 --> 01:17:44,700
And now some of us laugh at outer space.

664
01:17:48,600 --> 01:17:52,600
God help us... in the future.

665
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:26,600
