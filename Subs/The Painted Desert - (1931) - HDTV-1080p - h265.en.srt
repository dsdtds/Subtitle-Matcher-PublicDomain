1
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,801
Give me a hand here, cash.

2
00:02:53,979 --> 00:02:55,810
Ooh, you know I will.

3
00:03:12,748 --> 00:03:14,238
Poor little cuss.

4
00:03:16,084 --> 00:03:17,949
It appears to me

5
00:03:18,128 --> 00:03:22,041
we'll be splitting our grubstake
three ways from now on, cash.

6
00:03:22,215 --> 00:03:25,127
Yeah. I reckon so.

7
00:03:31,224 --> 00:03:34,808
Ohh. What have we got
that'll fit his gizzard?

8
00:03:37,189 --> 00:03:38,599
He can't chaw jerky.

9
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:40,980
Oh, you don't know nothin'.

10
00:03:42,611 --> 00:03:47,071
Oatmeal gruel and a mite of bacon grease
will see him through.

11
00:03:48,116 --> 00:03:49,481
Come on, partner.

12
00:03:53,121 --> 00:03:54,406
Ohh.

13
00:04:18,855 --> 00:04:20,436
Yes, sir.

14
00:04:43,171 --> 00:04:44,911
Give me a hand here with the boy, cash.

15
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:46,580
You know I will.

16
00:04:52,973 --> 00:04:56,306
- Hey.
- Hey, you little rascal, you.

17
00:04:56,476 --> 00:04:58,808
Hey. Giddyap. Giddyap.

18
00:05:05,944 --> 00:05:09,357
Here. You're going to get
your shirt on now, bill.

19
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:13,315
Here. That's right.

20
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,034
Pretty little cuss, ain't he, Jeff?

21
00:05:17,205 --> 00:05:18,786
- He sure is.
- Yeah.

22
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,369
Looks just like me.

23
00:05:22,836 --> 00:05:23,836
Don't you, bill?

24
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:27,381
Hmm.

25
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:32,172
- Here we are. Here we are.
- Hey.

26
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:35,636
- Here we are, boy.
- Hey.

27
00:05:35,807 --> 00:05:37,343
Oh, jeez, that boy.

28
00:05:37,517 --> 00:05:40,634
Hmm. Bill sure does love me, Jeff.

29
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:44,311
Mines.

30
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:51,273
Come on, baby.

31
00:05:52,866 --> 00:05:53,901
Boy...

32
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,661
Attaboy.

33
00:06:04,836 --> 00:06:05,996
Lovely boy.

34
00:06:10,258 --> 00:06:13,250
Here. Take a swig of this, bill.

35
00:06:13,595 --> 00:06:14,960
It'll put hair on your chest.

36
00:06:15,138 --> 00:06:17,254
Don't be giving that Maverick poison.

37
00:06:17,432 --> 00:06:19,639
And don't be calling him bill.

38
00:06:20,018 --> 00:06:21,974
Once and for all, cash holbrook,

39
00:06:22,145 --> 00:06:25,478
we're callin' him Daniel Boone Cameron.

40
00:06:35,325 --> 00:06:37,281
And once and for all, Jeff Cameron,

41
00:06:37,452 --> 00:06:40,785
we're calling him buffalo bill holbrook.

42
00:06:41,623 --> 00:06:44,239
I've put up with your bullheadedness
about long enough.

43
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:46,453
Bullheadedness? Me?

44
00:06:47,254 --> 00:06:49,461
Why, you hammer-headed old mule.

45
00:06:49,631 --> 00:06:51,711
You're as stubborn
about branding that yearling as...

46
00:06:51,758 --> 00:06:53,794
As you are about wanting
to settle down here

47
00:06:53,969 --> 00:06:56,176
at this measly water hole.

48
00:06:56,346 --> 00:06:59,304
Water means a grubstake
in this country, cash.

49
00:06:59,474 --> 00:07:01,305
We're stayin' right here.

50
00:07:01,476 --> 00:07:04,218
No. We ain't.

51
00:07:04,813 --> 00:07:05,893
You are.

52
00:07:07,524 --> 00:07:10,015
Grubstake's just about as far
as you can see.

53
00:07:10,902 --> 00:07:13,234
I'm headin' west till I hit grazing land.

54
00:07:14,948 --> 00:07:18,315
I've put up with your stubbornness
ever since we started out, Jeff.

55
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,326
Now I'm done with you.

56
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:11,577
If you're headin' west,
it seems to me you'd best get goin'.

57
00:08:11,755 --> 00:08:14,747
Now, then, I'll take Dan.

58
00:08:17,719 --> 00:08:20,335
- Bill's going with me.
- Oh, no, he ain't.

59
00:08:20,513 --> 00:08:22,344
He's too smart for you, holbrook.

60
00:08:23,016 --> 00:08:24,972
He's a Cameron,
and he knows where he belongs.

61
00:08:25,477 --> 00:08:29,516
He's a bit young to know what a pigheaded
old hyena you are, Cameron.

62
00:08:29,898 --> 00:08:31,058
But I'll learn him.

63
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:35,100
You wouldn't plug Dan...

64
00:08:36,029 --> 00:08:37,360
Would you, Cameron?

65
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:57,919
And if you was to drill me in the back
while I was riding away,

66
00:08:58,093 --> 00:09:02,086
why, you'd just naturally bust
bill's neck.

67
00:10:14,669 --> 00:10:15,829
Mary Ellen?

68
00:10:19,674 --> 00:10:22,131
- Yes, dad?
- They're comin'.

69
00:10:34,564 --> 00:10:36,054
Put your ear to the ground.

70
00:10:42,447 --> 00:10:44,062
- Cattle.
- Yep.

71
00:10:44,824 --> 00:10:46,735
You see? I was right, Mary Ellen.

72
00:10:46,910 --> 00:10:50,698
When I seen that big, ornery bill holbrook
riding the Ridge this morning,

73
00:10:50,872 --> 00:10:53,454
I figured that him and his old man
was up to something.

74
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:57,288
Dad, them two are just alike,
meaner than two rattlers.

75
00:10:57,462 --> 00:10:59,999
Cash holbrook ruined the boy, Mary Ellen.

76
00:11:00,173 --> 00:11:02,380
He was a lively young'un when I found him.

77
00:11:02,550 --> 00:11:05,337
Well, dad, if they think they're
gonna water cattle here tonight,

78
00:11:05,512 --> 00:11:08,219
here's two winchesters say they ain't.

79
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,687
We'll get to the water hole
quicker that way.

80
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:23,647
All right, turn it.

81
00:11:24,322 --> 00:11:26,483
You know more about it than I do, Kirby.

82
00:11:27,909 --> 00:11:31,822
I ain't set foot on Jeff Cameron's land
in a good many years.

83
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:36,164
I wouldn't be doing it tonight
if this herd wasn't drying up on me.

84
00:11:36,334 --> 00:11:37,949
Well, we won't have no trouble.

85
00:11:38,128 --> 00:11:41,291
There ain't nobody at the water hole
but old Cameron and his daughter.

86
00:11:41,673 --> 00:11:43,459
I don't care if there's 50 of them.

87
00:11:44,634 --> 00:11:48,218
Cameron ain't keepin' me away
from that water no longer.

88
00:11:49,180 --> 00:11:50,180
So long.

89
00:12:01,067 --> 00:12:02,067
Listen.

90
00:12:03,194 --> 00:12:04,274
What was that?

91
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:07,354
Someone afoot.

92
00:12:20,044 --> 00:12:21,284
Stay where you are.

93
00:12:29,512 --> 00:12:30,718
What do you want here?

94
00:12:33,099 --> 00:12:35,590
Water. I can use some.

95
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:39,135
My name's rance Brett.

96
00:12:39,814 --> 00:12:42,726
Had to shoot my horse today.
Prairie dog hole.

97
00:12:42,901 --> 00:12:45,062
This is the first water I've seen since.

98
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:47,394
I don't know this country.

99
00:12:49,574 --> 00:12:53,112
You don't know cash holbrook
neither, I suppose?

100
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:55,287
Who?

101
00:13:00,001 --> 00:13:01,161
Go ahead, fill up.

102
00:13:02,712 --> 00:13:03,918
Thanks, mister.

103
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:43,919
Well?

104
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:52,542
Who's this, uh, holbrook
you were talkin' about?

105
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,836
You never heard of him, I suppose.

106
00:13:56,099 --> 00:13:57,930
Miss, I'm from Montana,

107
00:13:59,018 --> 00:14:01,225
and I'm headed new Mexico way.

108
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:04,645
What was your name in Montana?

109
00:14:11,906 --> 00:14:14,568
Brett. Same as here.

110
00:14:15,576 --> 00:14:17,532
And I'm headed new Mexico way.

111
00:14:20,790 --> 00:14:22,451
At least I was.

112
00:14:24,168 --> 00:14:25,704
While I had a horse.

113
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,757
Seems like I've stepped
into something here, mister.

114
00:14:33,928 --> 00:14:36,294
Might be you'd care
to enlighten me of what.

115
00:14:37,890 --> 00:14:40,848
Cameron's my name. Jeff Cameron.

116
00:14:42,103 --> 00:14:43,593
My daughter, Mary Ellen.

117
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,186
I'm honored to know you, miss Cameron.

118
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:50,107
This here is my livin'.

119
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:53,987
The only water hole
between the range and the railroad.

120
00:14:54,782 --> 00:14:58,400
Cowmen all water here
on their way to the loading pens.

121
00:14:58,578 --> 00:14:59,863
All but one.

122
00:15:01,706 --> 00:15:03,492
This, uh, holbrook fella?

123
00:15:05,877 --> 00:15:06,877
Yeah.

124
00:15:08,087 --> 00:15:10,453
I make him go the long way for water.

125
00:15:11,341 --> 00:15:15,175
Twenty-seven miles across the desert,
losing beef every mile.

126
00:15:16,721 --> 00:15:17,721
Why?

127
00:15:21,726 --> 00:15:22,726
Got a match?

128
00:15:33,946 --> 00:15:38,235
When they smell that water,
they're going big for a lection.

129
00:15:38,409 --> 00:15:40,525
Fire and brimstone won't stop 'em.

130
00:15:40,703 --> 00:15:42,614
Neither will Jeff Cameron.

131
00:15:43,331 --> 00:15:45,492
I got married and settled down here.

132
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,406
He kept on persecuting me.

133
00:15:48,544 --> 00:15:50,956
Why, it wasn't a month after her ma died,

134
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:53,166
he tried to stampede me into selling.

135
00:15:54,467 --> 00:15:56,253
It began right here,

136
00:15:56,427 --> 00:15:59,544
and it's liable to end right here,
tonight.

137
00:16:03,851 --> 00:16:06,388
- Meaning what?
- Meaning this.

138
00:16:09,357 --> 00:16:10,847
Miss, do you aim to take aim?

139
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:13,732
I do if a holbrook crosses our line.

140
00:16:16,072 --> 00:16:17,687
Well, the odds ain't with you.

141
00:16:19,659 --> 00:16:23,618
Perhaps it'd even them up a little if I
might offer to throw in with you folks.

142
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:27,071
Thanks just the same.

143
00:16:28,042 --> 00:16:29,248
Well, put it this way:

144
00:16:29,961 --> 00:16:33,874
Maybe I could work it out around here
long enough to get me a horse.

145
00:16:36,634 --> 00:16:38,124
Startin' tonight.

146
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:46,473
They're comin'.

147
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:51,308
Throw a saddle onto one of them broncs.
We'll ride out to meet 'em.

148
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:53,733
Good enough.

149
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:56,313
They won't get in here tonight.

150
00:17:05,913 --> 00:17:07,995
They're gettin' mighty uneasy.

151
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:10,077
They're liable to start any minute now.

152
00:17:32,398 --> 00:17:34,184
We'll tangle with them right here.

153
00:17:34,358 --> 00:17:36,269
Mary Ellen, you get behind them rocks.

154
00:17:36,444 --> 00:17:38,564
Brett, you go hold out
on the other side of that wash.

155
00:17:38,738 --> 00:17:40,194
I'll stay here.

156
00:17:57,632 --> 00:17:59,873
Don't take no chances with yourself, now.

157
00:18:11,979 --> 00:18:13,435
There they go!

158
00:18:18,986 --> 00:18:20,021
Whoa.

159
00:18:26,953 --> 00:18:28,944
- It's a bunch of rustlers!
- No, it ain't.

160
00:18:29,121 --> 00:18:30,657
Cameron's got men to help him.

161
00:18:31,666 --> 00:18:34,624
They're stampeding the herd
away from the water hole!

162
00:18:50,393 --> 00:18:51,929
What happened?

163
00:18:52,103 --> 00:18:53,764
I'll tell you what's happened.

164
00:18:53,938 --> 00:18:55,849
They're not holbrook's cattle at all.

165
00:18:56,482 --> 00:19:00,566
But holbrook's got men running off stock
that's being drove to my water.

166
00:19:00,736 --> 00:19:02,522
He's tryin' to break me.

167
00:19:39,525 --> 00:19:41,641
Well, it might've been worse.

168
00:19:41,819 --> 00:19:43,480
We only lost a few head.

169
00:19:45,656 --> 00:19:50,571
Jeff Cameron declared war on me
when he drove them cattle off tonight.

170
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:55,113
Before it's over,
I'll drive him out of the country.

171
00:19:56,792 --> 00:19:59,329
I wonder who those men was helpin' him.

172
00:20:00,504 --> 00:20:02,586
I'll find that out too.

173
00:20:09,013 --> 00:20:11,925
- And when I do...
- Take it easy.

174
00:20:17,688 --> 00:20:20,054
I ran that herd out of there tonight, dad.

175
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:29,821
You ran that herd off?

176
00:20:34,997 --> 00:20:36,737
What's to make of all this, son?

177
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,998
I'll tell you, dad.

178
00:20:39,168 --> 00:20:43,332
I ran those cattle off to keep you
and Jeff Cameron from killing each other.

179
00:20:43,506 --> 00:20:44,506
Hmm.

180
00:20:46,717 --> 00:20:50,335
And who appointed you
to be my guardian angel?

181
00:20:51,305 --> 00:20:53,466
You and Jeff split over me, dad.

182
00:20:54,725 --> 00:20:57,216
Tonight, when I learned you
was gonna tangle, I had to stop it.

183
00:20:57,395 --> 00:21:00,057
Yeah, and make a fool out of me
right in front of him,

184
00:21:00,231 --> 00:21:02,187
to say nothin' of the cattle lost.

185
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:06,893
Dad, you and Jeff shared
your last flapjack once.

186
00:21:08,030 --> 00:21:11,397
Since then, you've wasted
all those years hating each other.

187
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:15,701
But it's not too late.

188
00:21:16,872 --> 00:21:18,578
I've got something to show you.

189
00:21:25,381 --> 00:21:26,461
You see that?

190
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:28,800
Hmm.

191
00:21:30,761 --> 00:21:32,092
Well, what is it?

192
00:21:34,932 --> 00:21:35,967
What about it?

193
00:21:37,643 --> 00:21:39,508
That is tungsten ore.

194
00:21:40,312 --> 00:21:42,974
There might be a little gold
and silver in it too.

195
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,472
But the tungsten is what counts.

196
00:21:46,527 --> 00:21:49,018
And I've located a rich deposit of it.

197
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:52,071
But there's a catch to it.

198
00:21:55,286 --> 00:21:56,947
Just what are you driving at?

199
00:21:58,038 --> 00:22:02,077
Well, the man that owns the land that
this is on doesn't even know it's there.

200
00:22:02,251 --> 00:22:03,912
If he did, he couldn't mine it.

201
00:22:04,837 --> 00:22:05,997
He's broke.

202
00:22:07,631 --> 00:22:10,293
You've got the money,
and I know how to run a mine.

203
00:22:12,136 --> 00:22:13,171
You can help him.

204
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:16,594
And he was once your friend.

205
00:22:17,975 --> 00:22:19,681
Now do you know who I mean?

206
00:22:22,563 --> 00:22:24,394
You mean Jeff Cameron?

207
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,146
Jeff Cameron.

208
00:22:28,903 --> 00:22:30,518
He needs your help, dad.

209
00:22:31,447 --> 00:22:34,359
He's old, and he's getting tired.

210
00:22:35,367 --> 00:22:37,358
He'll give in if you'll let him.

211
00:22:40,539 --> 00:22:41,995
Did I hear right?

212
00:22:43,083 --> 00:22:46,246
You want me to make up to him?

213
00:22:47,379 --> 00:22:49,415
I think it's about time you did, dad.

214
00:22:56,889 --> 00:23:00,131
I raised you single-handed and alone.

215
00:23:01,352 --> 00:23:04,970
I sent you to mining school
when you ought to have been punching cows.

216
00:23:05,147 --> 00:23:06,147
Right.

217
00:23:06,524 --> 00:23:11,393
I always let you have your say,
most always your own way.

218
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:16,318
But I'll see you eternally
in fire and brimstone

219
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:21,236
before I let you stand up there
and tell me to be friend to Jeff Cameron.

220
00:23:21,705 --> 00:23:25,072
I didn't tell you, dad. I asked you.

221
00:23:30,297 --> 00:23:34,085
A man sure gets punishment
for his mistakes.

222
00:23:35,678 --> 00:23:38,135
When I picked you up on the desert,

223
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:40,174
I made mine.

224
00:23:40,349 --> 00:23:43,011
I don't know what kind
of blood you got in you,

225
00:23:44,562 --> 00:23:46,553
but I know it ain't my kind.

226
00:23:50,734 --> 00:23:52,690
I'll say good night to you on that.

227
00:23:54,905 --> 00:23:56,861
And when I get up in the morning,

228
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,993
I don't think you'd better be here.

229
00:24:17,386 --> 00:24:18,501
You and Jeff...

230
00:24:19,763 --> 00:24:22,926
Have spent half your lives
building a wall that separates you...

231
00:24:24,268 --> 00:24:26,133
When you should've been friends.

232
00:24:27,771 --> 00:24:30,729
But someday I'll break it down.

233
00:24:33,485 --> 00:24:36,101
Good-bye... dad.

234
00:25:07,895 --> 00:25:08,895
Whoa.

235
00:25:21,575 --> 00:25:22,655
Whoa.

236
00:25:26,288 --> 00:25:27,778
Afternoon, miss Mary.

237
00:25:27,957 --> 00:25:30,369
You stay where you are, bill holbrook.

238
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:35,874
Is your father in?
I'd like to talk to him.

239
00:25:36,048 --> 00:25:39,711
You must be craving trouble to come here
after what you done last night.

240
00:25:41,428 --> 00:25:42,588
Last night?

241
00:25:42,763 --> 00:25:44,469
Don't try to brazen it out.

242
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,382
I saw you and your hands
run them cattle off.

243
00:25:47,559 --> 00:25:51,097
You must feel mighty proud of yourself,
takin' away our livin'.

244
00:25:55,776 --> 00:25:58,016
If you'll excuse me now,
I'll go and talk to your father.

245
00:25:58,821 --> 00:26:00,732
You'll not set foot on our land.

246
00:26:06,537 --> 00:26:08,528
I'll take care of him, Mary Ellen.

247
00:26:09,206 --> 00:26:11,288
You ride over
and get a hold of rance Brett.

248
00:26:11,834 --> 00:26:13,825
He's stringing new wire up at the gap.

249
00:26:19,383 --> 00:26:20,589
What are you doing here?

250
00:26:22,678 --> 00:26:25,294
Mr. Cameron,
I'd like to have a little talk with you.

251
00:26:25,472 --> 00:26:27,303
I ain't got nothin' to talk to you about.

252
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:31,092
You will have
when you've heard what I've got to say.

253
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:33,386
Your threats don't bother me none.

254
00:26:34,773 --> 00:26:36,058
Get on inside.

255
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:53,740
Now, then, do your talkin',
and talk mighty careful.

256
00:27:08,348 --> 00:27:11,215
Hi there! Mary Ellen!

257
00:27:11,393 --> 00:27:12,758
Hello there, tonopah!

258
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:15,811
Hey! Come on, heliotrope.

259
00:27:15,981 --> 00:27:17,767
See who's waitin' for you.

260
00:27:17,941 --> 00:27:20,648
Look who's waitin' to see you, doggone ya.
Come on.

261
00:27:23,989 --> 00:27:28,198
Well, Mary Ellen.
Why, you're gettin' prettier every day.

262
00:27:28,368 --> 00:27:29,733
How's old heliotrope?

263
00:27:29,912 --> 00:27:31,527
Oh, lazier than the deuce.

264
00:27:31,705 --> 00:27:33,286
Where you in from this time, tonopah?

265
00:27:33,457 --> 00:27:35,368
Tornado basin. Whew.

266
00:27:35,542 --> 00:27:38,329
My gosh, I pretty near dried up
and blowed away.

267
00:27:38,504 --> 00:27:40,085
Where you runnin' off to?

268
00:27:40,255 --> 00:27:43,964
Oh, dad's got that bill holbrook inside,
and I'm gonna go over and...

269
00:27:44,134 --> 00:27:45,499
- Bill holbrook?
- Yeah.

270
00:27:45,677 --> 00:27:47,258
Oh, doggone it.

271
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:49,670
I knowed I had some news for you.

272
00:27:49,848 --> 00:27:51,839
Hey, listen. Listen to this.

273
00:27:52,017 --> 00:27:53,928
I came by holbrook's this morning,

274
00:27:54,103 --> 00:27:58,062
and, uh, there ain't been a ruckus
like that around here

275
00:27:58,232 --> 00:27:59,597
like they had in years,

276
00:27:59,775 --> 00:28:02,187
and I went up and I...

277
00:28:02,361 --> 00:28:06,730
If you... uh, doggone it, maybe I'd better
begin at the beginning, huh?

278
00:28:06,907 --> 00:28:08,067
Yeah. Well...

279
00:28:11,328 --> 00:28:13,819
On my land,
and it takes my water to mine it.

280
00:28:15,082 --> 00:28:16,117
That's right.

281
00:28:19,378 --> 00:28:20,378
Well...

282
00:28:22,381 --> 00:28:24,463
I made out alone a good many years.

283
00:28:27,136 --> 00:28:29,798
And I ain't takin' a holbrook
for a partner just yet.

284
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,392
If you can borrow money
at the bank to mine this stuff,

285
00:28:36,562 --> 00:28:37,597
so can I.

286
00:28:38,897 --> 00:28:40,433
Yes, you can, Jeff.

287
00:28:43,694 --> 00:28:44,854
Say...

288
00:28:46,405 --> 00:28:48,191
How come you have to borrow money?

289
00:28:52,828 --> 00:28:54,864
Have you fought with cash holbrook?

290
00:28:57,166 --> 00:29:00,374
With cash? After what he's done for me?

291
00:29:05,299 --> 00:29:07,756
No, but he's fought with you.

292
00:29:08,594 --> 00:29:09,594
Ain't that it?

293
00:29:13,432 --> 00:29:14,467
I knowed it.

294
00:29:15,726 --> 00:29:18,217
Cash wouldn't have no truck with me.

295
00:29:18,395 --> 00:29:19,851
No more than I would with him.

296
00:29:21,773 --> 00:29:25,231
But he's on the outs with you...
Over that.

297
00:29:27,738 --> 00:29:31,856
Jeff, cash thinks he's right
in hating you.

298
00:29:33,327 --> 00:29:36,490
Just the same as you think
you're right in hating him.

299
00:29:38,207 --> 00:29:39,947
But you're both dead wrong.

300
00:29:41,543 --> 00:29:45,286
I've told him that. Now I'm telling you.

301
00:29:46,173 --> 00:29:48,414
And someday
I'll make you both believe it.

302
00:29:48,592 --> 00:29:50,878
Never. Don't you try it.

303
00:29:51,428 --> 00:29:53,669
- I'll never stop.
- Might as well.

304
00:29:54,223 --> 00:29:56,805
That stuff can lay in the ground
till judgment day

305
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,806
before I have dealings with a holbrook.

306
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,225
Well...

307
00:30:06,568 --> 00:30:08,024
That's what I am.

308
00:30:10,530 --> 00:30:11,530
Hold on.

309
00:30:12,824 --> 00:30:14,564
By the eternal, you ain't.

310
00:30:16,787 --> 00:30:19,494
You're a Cameron by rights. I found you.

311
00:30:20,374 --> 00:30:25,038
You pointed me out to be your pa
right here at this water hole years ago.

312
00:30:26,255 --> 00:30:27,995
Did I, Jeff? You sure did.

313
00:30:28,757 --> 00:30:30,748
And I knowed I'd get you back someday.

314
00:30:32,803 --> 00:30:34,168
You belong right here.

315
00:30:36,682 --> 00:30:38,468
I'll throw in with you, bill.

316
00:30:38,642 --> 00:30:40,428
Mean Dan.

317
00:30:41,853 --> 00:30:45,141
Water and all. Give me that stuff.

318
00:30:45,315 --> 00:30:46,805
So, you see, Mary Ellen,

319
00:30:46,984 --> 00:30:49,851
in doing what he allowed
was right about them cattle,

320
00:30:50,028 --> 00:30:53,020
he riled cash holbrook
into throwing him out of the house.

321
00:31:05,002 --> 00:31:09,166
Well, I've got to be in town a few days,
but we'll break ground in about a week.

322
00:31:09,339 --> 00:31:13,332
When cash holbrook hears about this,
he'll have to be hog-tied.

323
00:31:24,980 --> 00:31:26,311
Come here.

324
00:31:31,778 --> 00:31:34,565
- See you in about a week.
- Good luck.

325
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:40,989
Well, Jeff, doggone it,
I'm glad to see you. How be you?

326
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:42,369
Hello, tonopah.

327
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:46,282
Say, bill holbrook, uh, was over here,

328
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:48,700
and you and him seemed
to be kind of friendly, don't you?

329
00:31:48,754 --> 00:31:50,460
- You bet we're friendly.
- Yeah.

330
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:53,167
Say, did you hear about what happened
between he and cash?

331
00:31:53,342 --> 00:31:55,378
- Yes, I heard...
- They had an awful rumpus.

332
00:31:55,552 --> 00:31:56,291
Yes, I...

333
00:31:56,470 --> 00:31:58,031
Cash throwed his own boy out of the house.

334
00:31:58,055 --> 00:31:59,636
His own boy, mind you.

335
00:31:59,806 --> 00:32:01,512
What do you mean? What?

336
00:32:01,683 --> 00:32:03,514
What do you mean, his own boy?

337
00:32:03,685 --> 00:32:05,141
He's my boy.

338
00:32:05,312 --> 00:32:07,974
Your... how could you... would you...

339
00:32:08,148 --> 00:32:10,685
He's my boy now.

340
00:32:28,377 --> 00:32:30,789
I've got something to say to you.

341
00:32:30,962 --> 00:32:32,577
I've got no use for you,

342
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:35,623
and I've been raised to hate
everything that carries your brand.

343
00:32:36,218 --> 00:32:39,927
But I've got to tell you
that, well, I'm sorry for what I said.

344
00:32:40,097 --> 00:32:42,964
I didn't know then why you run
them cattle off last night.

345
00:32:44,184 --> 00:32:46,721
It's mighty nice of you to say that,
miss Mary.

346
00:32:47,354 --> 00:32:51,893
You know, you had me a mite uneasy
with that Winchester.

347
00:32:52,067 --> 00:32:54,058
What have you been talking dad into?

348
00:32:54,694 --> 00:32:56,776
Lots of things.

349
00:33:17,300 --> 00:33:20,792
So, you see, you and your dad will have
more money than you'll ever need.

350
00:33:21,388 --> 00:33:24,095
You can have all the things
you've always wanted,

351
00:33:24,266 --> 00:33:26,473
all the things you should've had.

352
00:33:26,643 --> 00:33:31,387
Oh, it... it doesn't seem possible
anything so wonderful could happen to us.

353
00:33:32,274 --> 00:33:33,935
It's always been out there,

354
00:33:34,484 --> 00:33:36,691
but I'm glad I was the one
that found it for you.

355
00:33:36,862 --> 00:33:41,322
Hmm. You know,
the desert's taken so much out of dad.

356
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,367
Gee, it doesn't seem possible
it's about to pay it all back.

357
00:33:45,871 --> 00:33:48,954
I'm happier for him even than I am for me.

358
00:33:51,084 --> 00:33:54,668
Mary Ellen,
look out there across the desert.

359
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,251
As far as you can see.

360
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:01,590
Way off there in the distance.

361
00:34:02,721 --> 00:34:05,554
Do you see those big, lonesome pinnacles?

362
00:34:08,185 --> 00:34:09,800
When I was a little boy,

363
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:14,472
I used to lie out there evenings,
watching the shadows cross over them.

364
00:34:15,734 --> 00:34:18,521
I used to imagine
they were all sorts of things.

365
00:34:19,738 --> 00:34:22,229
- Dragons fighting.
- Hmm.

366
00:34:22,407 --> 00:34:24,489
Giants lying there, sleeping.

367
00:34:25,202 --> 00:34:26,783
And great, big monsters

368
00:34:26,953 --> 00:34:29,069
that might come down after it got dark
and get me.

369
00:34:29,247 --> 00:34:32,580
I know. I used to think that way too.

370
00:34:33,001 --> 00:34:34,537
You got over it though.

371
00:34:34,961 --> 00:34:37,293
Over it? Why, sure.

372
00:34:37,464 --> 00:34:39,546
As soon as I knew what they really was...

373
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:40,922
Just big rocks.

374
00:34:41,718 --> 00:34:44,630
But before that, you were a little bit
afraid of them, weren't you?

375
00:34:45,096 --> 00:34:46,211
Yes, I was.

376
00:34:48,141 --> 00:34:50,632
Well, it's just that way with folks.

377
00:34:52,187 --> 00:34:55,679
Now, way off in the distance
of you or mine,

378
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:59,649
there's a terrible man
called cash holbrook.

379
00:35:01,404 --> 00:35:04,146
To you, he's been one
of those awful monsters

380
00:35:04,324 --> 00:35:05,860
that you used to imagine.

381
00:35:08,119 --> 00:35:12,078
But I've been up close to him
in the broad daylight,

382
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,038
and to me, he's been a kind man

383
00:35:18,088 --> 00:35:19,453
and mighty good.

384
00:35:21,258 --> 00:35:26,594
I never had anyone make things
so sort of clear to me before.

385
00:35:27,222 --> 00:35:32,182
Hmm. Would you think I was kind of crazy
if I asked you to forgive me

386
00:35:32,352 --> 00:35:35,094
for the thoughts I've held
about you all these years?

387
00:35:37,857 --> 00:35:39,848
I can't do that, Mary Ellen.

388
00:35:41,361 --> 00:35:43,226
There's nothing to forgive.

389
00:35:44,573 --> 00:35:46,689
I hope there won't never be.

390
00:36:52,599 --> 00:36:55,011
Well, we've done it, we've done it.

391
00:36:55,185 --> 00:36:56,766
There she sits.

392
00:36:56,936 --> 00:37:01,054
The first load ready to roll,
and it's right on time.

393
00:37:01,232 --> 00:37:04,520
And none too soon.
You know something, Jeff?

394
00:37:04,694 --> 00:37:07,936
Banks have a very funny habit
of wanting their money on time.

395
00:37:08,114 --> 00:37:10,070
And they'll get their wish tomorrow.

396
00:37:10,241 --> 00:37:13,324
And from then on, those wagons
will keep right on rolling.

397
00:37:13,495 --> 00:37:15,986
And the mine will pay its way.

398
00:37:16,164 --> 00:37:20,203
I guess I'm all ready. The wagons
are about to start, I guess, huh?

399
00:37:20,377 --> 00:37:22,063
You're not sorry you're going,
though, are you?

400
00:37:22,087 --> 00:37:24,578
Of course she ain't.
Mary Ellen always wanted to go to school.

401
00:37:24,756 --> 00:37:25,996
Ain't you, Mary Ellen?

402
00:37:26,174 --> 00:37:31,009
Yes, but it's gonna seem kind of lonesome
being away from all of you.

403
00:37:31,179 --> 00:37:34,717
Shucks, it won't be no time
before a vacation comes around.

404
00:37:34,891 --> 00:37:36,802
No, sir.

405
00:37:36,976 --> 00:37:38,011
Come on.

406
00:37:38,895 --> 00:37:40,305
Say, what's...

407
00:37:41,231 --> 00:37:42,516
What's in you?

408
00:37:42,691 --> 00:37:45,353
Friend... why... why ain't you
down there with the folks?

409
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,320
What for?

410
00:37:49,072 --> 00:37:52,690
Well, to say good-bye to Mary Ellen.

411
00:37:56,246 --> 00:37:59,329
I only work here. I got the teams ready.

412
00:37:59,499 --> 00:38:03,412
I guess that lets me out,
as far as she's concerned.

413
00:38:03,878 --> 00:38:07,666
Well, I know, but doggone it,
she's going away.

414
00:38:07,841 --> 00:38:09,797
She's going to school.

415
00:38:10,802 --> 00:38:12,508
- Yeah, I know.
- Yeah.

416
00:38:12,679 --> 00:38:13,839
Great idea.

417
00:38:14,472 --> 00:38:16,713
It took bill holbrook to think that up.

418
00:38:18,268 --> 00:38:20,133
Eh? What?

419
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:23,432
That girl in town alone.

420
00:38:24,107 --> 00:38:27,190
Oh, she's gonna live with old lady Gilroy.

421
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:28,816
She won't be lonesome.

422
00:38:29,654 --> 00:38:34,489
And bill holbrook will have to be
gettin' in town every week or two.

423
00:38:35,618 --> 00:38:36,618
Yeah?

424
00:38:37,996 --> 00:38:40,988
That'll be great.
You bet "twill.

425
00:38:44,294 --> 00:38:47,627
None of that, now, or I'll be smackin'
the daylights out of you.

426
00:39:03,104 --> 00:39:04,719
Help her there, Carson.

427
00:39:08,359 --> 00:39:11,897
I'm gonna launch
this here "pe-rade” right.

428
00:39:12,071 --> 00:39:16,940
I'm gonna bust a bottle
of real old corn right on her nose.

429
00:39:17,118 --> 00:39:18,118
Come on.

430
00:39:22,916 --> 00:39:28,786
J and bury me not on the lone prairie I

431
00:39:28,963 --> 00:39:32,251
I where the wild coyotes...

432
00:39:32,759 --> 00:39:34,966
Oh. Oh, rance?

433
00:39:45,730 --> 00:39:50,269
Hey, hold on there, everybody. Listen.

434
00:39:50,443 --> 00:39:55,483
When they launch a cornerstone,
they christen it.

435
00:39:55,657 --> 00:39:58,899
Uh, same as when they christen a ship,

436
00:39:59,077 --> 00:40:02,240
they launch a cornerstone, you understand?

437
00:40:02,413 --> 00:40:08,204
Well, uh, same as...
Same as you christen a mine.

438
00:40:08,378 --> 00:40:09,993
And that's that.

439
00:40:10,171 --> 00:40:14,289
Now I'm gonna christen
the... I'm gonna Chris...

440
00:40:14,467 --> 00:40:18,426
I'm gonna... ohh. Hey. Ohh.

441
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:22,092
Oh, doggone you, I christen you.

442
00:40:35,572 --> 00:40:36,812
Good-bye, rance.

443
00:40:43,288 --> 00:40:44,824
Why, what's the matter?

444
00:40:47,542 --> 00:40:48,782
Nothing.

445
00:40:49,419 --> 00:40:50,875
All ready, boss.

446
00:40:51,045 --> 00:40:52,626
All right, let her go.

447
00:40:54,299 --> 00:40:57,257
- Good-bye, Mary Ellen.
- Good-bye, bill.

448
00:40:57,427 --> 00:40:59,588
You'll come to see me soon,
won't you, bill?

449
00:40:59,762 --> 00:41:01,093
What do you think?

450
00:41:03,182 --> 00:41:04,888
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

451
00:41:26,706 --> 00:41:28,697
I'll tuck him in bed every night!

452
00:41:57,737 --> 00:41:59,147
Get!

453
00:42:03,618 --> 00:42:05,859
There's cash holbrook.

454
00:42:06,037 --> 00:42:08,028
Is this his land we're going through?

455
00:42:08,206 --> 00:42:11,323
Yeah. Both sides of us,
from here to the canyon.

456
00:42:11,501 --> 00:42:13,287
And ya get! Get!

457
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:17,086
Get out at it. Get.

458
00:42:18,424 --> 00:42:20,255
Get out at it.

459
00:42:20,843 --> 00:42:25,428
Well, it looks like the boy and Cameron
was doin' pretty good.

460
00:42:27,642 --> 00:42:28,722
Think so?

461
00:42:32,021 --> 00:42:33,021
Come on.

462
00:43:29,287 --> 00:43:30,287
Come on.

463
00:43:42,341 --> 00:43:44,332
Get! Get!

464
00:43:45,553 --> 00:43:47,214
Come on. Get!

465
00:43:47,388 --> 00:43:51,131
There, look. There's someone on the Ridge.

466
00:43:51,309 --> 00:43:54,676
Oh, just some of the cowhands
comin' in off the range, that's all.

467
00:43:54,854 --> 00:43:56,845
Why don't they use the road, I wonder?

468
00:43:57,023 --> 00:43:59,105
Oh, they ain't civilized enough.

469
00:44:09,118 --> 00:44:12,281
Denver, look. There they are again.

470
00:44:12,455 --> 00:44:14,446
Just don't fret yourself, now.

471
00:45:18,938 --> 00:45:20,428
Hey.

472
00:45:21,399 --> 00:45:23,319
What's the matter?
What's happened? What's wrong?

473
00:45:23,401 --> 00:45:24,921
- Are you hurt, boy?
- No, ma'am.

474
00:45:24,986 --> 00:45:27,022
But we're shy seven tons of ore

475
00:45:27,196 --> 00:45:29,687
and two wagons
and quite some mule-power though.

476
00:45:29,866 --> 00:45:31,356
Where'd they get to? Who was it?

477
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:34,863
We was kind of busy.
We didn't stop to ask.

478
00:45:35,037 --> 00:45:38,575
Don't be squabblin' about that.
We want to get Mary Ellen out of here.

479
00:45:38,749 --> 00:45:39,955
Come on, fellas. Hop on.

480
00:45:40,126 --> 00:45:43,289
Let's get out of here. Come on.
Make it easier, now.

481
00:45:43,462 --> 00:45:44,827
Roll on into town.

482
00:45:45,006 --> 00:45:46,962
I'll beat it back to the mine
and tell bill.

483
00:45:47,133 --> 00:45:49,715
Get! Get! Get! Get!

484
00:46:07,361 --> 00:46:09,397
- What?
- Why, it's Tex.

485
00:46:09,572 --> 00:46:12,154
What's going on here? Let's go and see.

486
00:46:12,992 --> 00:46:14,107
What happened?

487
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:17,364
Easy, boss. Wait a minute.

488
00:46:18,414 --> 00:46:21,030
- What's the matter, Doyle?
- Somebody's plugged him.

489
00:46:22,710 --> 00:46:24,450
What happened, Tex? Are you hurt bad?

490
00:46:24,629 --> 00:46:27,837
They... they got us at the rim.

491
00:46:36,224 --> 00:46:38,260
Are you sure she's all right?

492
00:46:38,434 --> 00:46:41,676
Yes. Got through. In town by now.

493
00:46:43,105 --> 00:46:44,970
Boys, get him into my house quick.

494
00:46:46,525 --> 00:46:49,813
Doyle, get both your shifts out.
We're gonna start loading.

495
00:46:50,238 --> 00:46:52,479
Brett, I've got to have
two wagons and a tank.

496
00:46:52,657 --> 00:46:54,147
- Get them mules on 'em.
- Okay.

497
00:46:54,325 --> 00:46:57,988
And listen, a thousand dollars for the
shift that gets their wagon loaded first.

498
00:47:02,667 --> 00:47:03,998
Bring down some torches.

499
00:47:04,168 --> 00:47:06,284
Did you see anything of cash holbrook?

500
00:47:06,462 --> 00:47:09,829
Yeah. Passed him, some of his men.

501
00:47:10,466 --> 00:47:12,832
Crossing, he is, north 160.

502
00:47:13,844 --> 00:47:15,209
I knowed it.

503
00:47:21,811 --> 00:47:23,347
Cash holbrook done that.

504
00:47:25,731 --> 00:47:28,222
Cash didn't have any more
to do with that than I did.

505
00:47:28,401 --> 00:47:29,766
Nobody but him would ever...

506
00:47:29,944 --> 00:47:32,356
That's enough, Jeff. You're wrong.

507
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:35,363
We've got to get seven tons of ore
into that railroad by morning,

508
00:47:35,533 --> 00:47:38,195
or the bank will be in the mining business
instead of us.

509
00:47:39,662 --> 00:47:41,448
And I'm gonna drive.

510
00:47:46,669 --> 00:47:48,375
Is he hurt bad, Charlie?

511
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:50,753
Just creased a little, bill.

512
00:47:50,923 --> 00:47:52,413
Oh, he'll be all right.

513
00:47:53,676 --> 00:47:55,007
Take it easy, boy.

514
00:48:00,683 --> 00:48:01,763
I'm goin' with you.

515
00:48:01,934 --> 00:48:05,643
If cash holbrook thinks he can get away
with anything like this, I...

516
00:48:05,813 --> 00:48:08,304
You're gonna stay right here on the job.

517
00:48:08,482 --> 00:48:10,438
And I'll tell you something else.

518
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:12,270
I'm goin' through.

519
00:48:13,612 --> 00:48:17,230
Nobody's gonna stop me.
Do you understand that?

520
00:48:17,742 --> 00:48:19,107
Nobody.

521
00:48:26,542 --> 00:48:27,827
Hurry up, boys.

522
00:49:11,879 --> 00:49:13,415
We're comin' to the canyon rim!

523
00:49:13,589 --> 00:49:14,589
Hang on!

524
00:49:19,637 --> 00:49:22,128
- What about you, Flynn?
- I never thought of it.

525
00:49:22,306 --> 00:49:23,716
Well, tiny, you ought to know.

526
00:49:24,475 --> 00:49:26,591
Here comes Carson and the boys.

527
00:49:27,478 --> 00:49:29,969
Set out a bottle, clem.
They'll be wantin' it.

528
00:49:30,147 --> 00:49:31,182
Right, yes.

529
00:49:31,982 --> 00:49:33,267
Seen the sheriff yet?

530
00:49:33,442 --> 00:49:36,058
No, he's over to red rock.
Be back tomorrow.

531
00:49:36,570 --> 00:49:38,310
- Gentlemen.
- Hi, judge.

532
00:49:38,489 --> 00:49:40,150
The silver dollar welcomes you.

533
00:49:40,324 --> 00:49:41,924
Have one on the house, boys.

534
00:49:41,951 --> 00:49:42,951
Ah.

535
00:49:43,911 --> 00:49:45,617
Well, how's the little lady feeling?

536
00:49:45,788 --> 00:49:49,827
I, uh... oh, here's Denver now.
How's Mary Ellen, Denver?

537
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:52,366
Well, miss Gilroy finally
got to lay down for a spell.

538
00:49:52,545 --> 00:49:54,331
Excited state. She's rare.

539
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:56,496
She wanted to start back
to the mine on horseback.

540
00:49:56,674 --> 00:49:57,834
Worried about bill, huh?

541
00:49:58,008 --> 00:50:00,215
Worried? She's loco about him.

542
00:50:00,386 --> 00:50:02,172
Bill holbrook? Mm.

543
00:50:02,346 --> 00:50:03,346
Yeah.

544
00:50:04,223 --> 00:50:07,761
Wow. Wait'll his old man hears about that.

545
00:50:07,935 --> 00:50:08,935
Yeah.

546
00:50:11,647 --> 00:50:13,888
- Hi, Santa fe.
- All right.

547
00:50:17,778 --> 00:50:19,314
Here's your bill of lading, Carson.

548
00:50:19,488 --> 00:50:21,319
All right, Santa fe. Have a drink.

549
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:22,980
Sure! I never refuse.

550
00:50:24,034 --> 00:50:25,990
- How are you, Santa fe?
- Howdy.

551
00:50:26,162 --> 00:50:28,369
A lot of good that's gonna do us.

552
00:50:28,998 --> 00:50:30,613
Seven tons of ore on the car,

553
00:50:30,791 --> 00:50:32,471
and seven more
in the bottom of the canyon.

554
00:50:32,543 --> 00:50:34,454
Yeah, if that old rib-pickin' buzzard...

555
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:36,164
Say, what is his name?

556
00:50:36,338 --> 00:50:37,919
- At the bank?
- Stilson.

557
00:50:38,090 --> 00:50:40,706
That's him.
He won't wait five minutes for his dough.

558
00:50:40,885 --> 00:50:42,841
He'd love to get his hooks into that mine.

559
00:50:43,012 --> 00:50:45,344
Well, that's pretty near now, yeah?

560
00:50:47,099 --> 00:50:50,637
Time enough for another load,
if Tex got through.

561
00:50:50,811 --> 00:50:52,551
Say, who do you allow done it?

562
00:50:52,730 --> 00:50:54,345
- Dumpin' the wagons?
- Yeah.

563
00:50:54,523 --> 00:50:57,435
Well, I'd say it was cash holbrook.

564
00:50:57,610 --> 00:51:00,192
Don't you think that's
a pretty broad statement, young fella?

565
00:51:00,362 --> 00:51:03,650
Well, givin' you a straight answer,
judge, I don't.

566
00:51:03,824 --> 00:51:06,281
You talk a whole lot with your mouth,
don't you, Steve?

567
00:51:06,452 --> 00:51:07,282
He's right.

568
00:51:07,453 --> 00:51:10,320
Holbrook wouldn't stop at nothin'
when it comes to Jeff Cameron.

569
00:51:17,087 --> 00:51:20,875
Hey. Cash holbrook just rolled in town.

570
00:51:23,636 --> 00:51:24,876
Yeah?

571
00:51:35,397 --> 00:51:36,512
What's that?

572
00:51:42,947 --> 00:51:44,107
It's bill!

573
00:51:51,163 --> 00:51:53,950
Give us a hand up here, Carson.
They plugged Sullivan.

574
00:51:54,124 --> 00:51:55,330
Line them up.

575
00:51:56,544 --> 00:51:58,330
I'll get on the other side.

576
00:51:59,547 --> 00:52:01,128
Hand him down here, bill!

577
00:52:01,298 --> 00:52:02,458
Take it easy, boy.

578
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:07,468
Did you get any of 'em?
Don't know. I didn't wait to see.

579
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:09,340
Hey, is Mary Ellen all right?

580
00:52:09,515 --> 00:52:11,255
You bet. She's resting over at Gilroy's.

581
00:52:11,433 --> 00:52:12,969
- Good.
- I'll get doc partridge, bill.

582
00:52:13,143 --> 00:52:14,349
Okay, buck.

583
00:52:14,979 --> 00:52:16,810
Well, did you see who they was?

584
00:52:16,981 --> 00:52:19,313
No, they tried to stampede us
into the canyon.

585
00:52:19,483 --> 00:52:21,565
That's what they done to me.

586
00:52:26,865 --> 00:52:28,776
Carson, you get that ore
over there to the car.

587
00:52:28,951 --> 00:52:29,690
Yeah.

588
00:52:29,868 --> 00:52:32,548
Santa fe, go along with him,
and hurry that bill of lading, will ya?

589
00:52:32,663 --> 00:52:35,780
Sure thing, bill.
I'll have it here in ten minutes.

590
00:52:36,625 --> 00:52:39,992
Cummings, you can go in
and tell old man stilson

591
00:52:40,170 --> 00:52:43,128
to write "paid in full”
right across that note of mine.

592
00:52:43,882 --> 00:52:46,168
Bill! Bill, you're safe!

593
00:52:47,636 --> 00:52:50,503
I knew you'd try and bring
those wagons through, and I...

594
00:52:50,681 --> 00:52:51,921
Oh, bill.

595
00:52:52,850 --> 00:52:54,966
The wagons had to come in, honey.

596
00:52:55,144 --> 00:52:56,600
And I had to know how you were.

597
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,226
Oh, I'm all right, but...

598
00:52:58,397 --> 00:53:00,479
Well, you'll have to go back there.

599
00:53:00,649 --> 00:53:03,265
I won't let you, bill.
I couldn't stand it.

600
00:53:11,035 --> 00:53:12,035
Honey...

601
00:53:25,966 --> 00:53:27,877
Oh, judge Matthews,

602
00:53:28,052 --> 00:53:31,044
do you think you could arrange
to marry a couple of people,

603
00:53:31,221 --> 00:53:34,679
say, about, uh, 4:00 this afternoon?

604
00:53:35,309 --> 00:53:39,769
If my suspicions is correct
as to the parties involved,

605
00:53:40,689 --> 00:53:43,021
I should be most honored.

606
00:53:46,195 --> 00:53:49,358
Hey, provney, will you ride out
to the mine and get a hold of Jeff?

607
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:50,737
Sure thing, bill.

608
00:53:50,908 --> 00:53:51,908
Buck?

609
00:53:53,285 --> 00:53:55,776
How's the chance of a loan
of a comb and brush?

610
00:53:55,954 --> 00:53:57,945
Huh? =a comb and brush.

611
00:53:59,249 --> 00:54:01,365
I got a good curry comb over at the barn.

612
00:54:24,066 --> 00:54:25,931
All right, clear out of there!

613
00:54:32,199 --> 00:54:33,860
You be all right here, dynamite?

614
00:54:34,034 --> 00:54:35,570
Yeah, plenty far.

615
00:54:36,662 --> 00:54:39,199
You know, Cameron, if I'm right...

616
00:54:39,373 --> 00:54:41,989
Of course, I could be wrong...
But if I'm right...

617
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:44,704
Wait'll I get these Jacks
up to the corral, dynamite.

618
00:54:44,878 --> 00:54:46,334
The blast won't bother them.

619
00:54:46,505 --> 00:54:47,961
Go ahead, rance.

620
00:54:48,507 --> 00:54:49,667
As I was sayin'...

621
00:54:50,718 --> 00:54:53,960
Of course, I could be wrong...
But if I'm right,

622
00:54:54,138 --> 00:54:56,880
there's somebody takin' dynamite
out of my powder house.

623
00:54:57,057 --> 00:54:59,298
Takin"? You mean stealin'?

624
00:54:59,476 --> 00:55:00,476
Yes, sir.

625
00:55:01,353 --> 00:55:04,811
Now, today, I counted out what I had.

626
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:08,644
Then I figured out what I ought to have.
And there's somebody around here...

627
00:55:08,819 --> 00:55:10,400
Say, by heck, you know,

628
00:55:10,571 --> 00:55:12,812
that fits in with something
that happened last night.

629
00:55:17,369 --> 00:55:18,950
Somebody around here's stealin' it.

630
00:55:19,121 --> 00:55:22,033
Say, look here, Jeff,
I didn't sleep very well last night,

631
00:55:22,207 --> 00:55:24,163
and I heard something,
because I couldn't do it

632
00:55:24,334 --> 00:55:25,949
with the bad tooth I got here, see?

633
00:55:26,128 --> 00:55:27,914
I did...

634
00:55:30,758 --> 00:55:32,874
And if I find out who it is, I'll...

635
00:55:41,101 --> 00:55:42,181
What's that?

636
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:45,431
- Somebody else shootin'?
- There hadn't better be.

637
00:56:14,343 --> 00:56:17,255
- Who's using powder down there?
- Nobody. We don't know what's happened.

638
00:56:19,723 --> 00:56:22,180
Clear, everybody! She's coming down!

639
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,176
- Anybody hurt?
- No, everybody got clear.

640
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:45,904
A minute ago, that was a producing mine,

641
00:56:47,251 --> 00:56:48,457
payin' its way.

642
00:56:49,753 --> 00:56:50,913
Now it's...

643
00:56:52,589 --> 00:56:53,589
Nothin'.

644
00:57:02,057 --> 00:57:03,057
Brett...

645
00:57:04,852 --> 00:57:06,513
You'd better ride into town.

646
00:57:07,896 --> 00:57:09,887
I don't feel quite up to it.

647
00:57:11,567 --> 00:57:15,731
Tell bill... the Cameron mining company...

648
00:57:19,658 --> 00:57:22,695
Ain't in business anymore.

649
00:57:27,332 --> 00:57:30,995
Well, bill, looks like now they'll be
puttin' the old branding iron on you.

650
00:57:31,169 --> 00:57:33,535
Oh, he ain't the first bronc
who broke a harness.

651
00:57:33,714 --> 00:57:36,547
Maybe not the first,
but sure enough the luckiest.

652
00:57:36,717 --> 00:57:38,173
- Yeah.
- My boy.

653
00:57:38,969 --> 00:57:43,178
In my many years as presiding justice
in this here township,

654
00:57:43,348 --> 00:57:44,963
I have never looked forward

655
00:57:45,142 --> 00:57:47,349
to splicing the holy bonds of matrimony

656
00:57:47,519 --> 00:57:49,134
unto no young couple

657
00:57:49,313 --> 00:57:52,350
with more salubrious feelings
of admiration and esteem.

658
00:57:52,524 --> 00:57:53,604
Hey!

659
00:57:54,943 --> 00:57:56,183
To our...

660
00:57:57,696 --> 00:58:01,314
Illustrative fellow citizen
William holbrook

661
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:04,107
and his charming bride-to-be.

662
00:58:04,286 --> 00:58:07,073
- Thank you, judge.
- Folks, let's partake.

663
00:58:07,247 --> 00:58:09,784
Hold on, fellers. Right after the wedding,

664
00:58:09,958 --> 00:58:12,916
me and buck here is givin'
a barbecue up to the ranch,

665
00:58:13,086 --> 00:58:15,202
and everybody in town's invited!

666
00:58:18,383 --> 00:58:20,999
Does that take in cash holbrook?

667
00:58:22,387 --> 00:58:23,843
Cash holbrook!

668
00:58:41,615 --> 00:58:43,401
Hello, dad.

669
00:58:44,910 --> 00:58:46,741
I'll take rye, bartender.

670
00:59:16,149 --> 00:59:19,858
Holbrook, Jeff Cameron
sent me in town to find you.

671
00:59:20,028 --> 00:59:22,360
- What's wrong?
- Plenty.

672
00:59:22,531 --> 00:59:24,146
There's been a slide at the mine.

673
00:59:24,324 --> 00:59:26,781
The mill's gone
and both shafts are filled.

674
00:59:26,952 --> 00:59:28,567
There's nothing left.

675
00:59:28,745 --> 00:59:29,905
Anybody hurt?

676
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:31,741
No, the first blast warned 'em.

677
00:59:31,915 --> 00:59:34,201
They was all out when she let go.

678
00:59:34,376 --> 00:59:36,662
Blast? What do you mean? What happened?

679
00:59:36,837 --> 00:59:40,500
The men say it sounded like
four explosions, the number-two drift.

680
00:59:40,674 --> 00:59:42,665
On the last one,
half the mountain cut loose.

681
00:59:46,888 --> 00:59:49,300
Well, I guess we're all through.

682
00:59:50,559 --> 00:59:52,345
What do they think happened?

683
00:59:54,396 --> 00:59:58,105
They think what half this town's thinking.

684
00:59:59,109 --> 01:00:00,109
What's that?

685
01:00:01,653 --> 01:00:03,189
Cash holbrook.

686
01:00:11,872 --> 01:00:13,828
Do you know cash holbrook?

687
01:00:16,918 --> 01:00:17,918
No.

688
01:00:19,588 --> 01:00:23,922
Well, he and Jeff Cameron have been
enemies for a good many years.

689
01:00:24,926 --> 01:00:26,962
He had a boy that he'd raised.

690
01:00:28,096 --> 01:00:29,677
Threw him out of his house.

691
01:00:32,392 --> 01:00:37,603
Folks always said that he
was mighty fond of that boy.

692
01:00:38,482 --> 01:00:41,770
Heh. Didn't look much like it
when he done that.

693
01:00:43,987 --> 01:00:46,899
The boy and Jeff Cameron went partners.

694
01:00:48,533 --> 01:00:51,946
Since then, he's hated Cameron
worse than ever.

695
01:00:53,955 --> 01:00:59,746
He's had more reason to be back of this
than any man in the world.

696
01:01:02,672 --> 01:01:04,162
Do you think he done it?

697
01:01:06,468 --> 01:01:07,628
No.

698
01:01:23,652 --> 01:01:25,859
Oh, uh, cummings.

699
01:01:27,823 --> 01:01:29,905
When the bank opens up in the morning,

700
01:01:30,700 --> 01:01:34,534
I want my account fixed up
so's it can be drawed on

701
01:01:34,704 --> 01:01:37,366
right up to the last two-bit piece

702
01:01:38,792 --> 01:01:40,157
by my boy...

703
01:01:45,006 --> 01:01:46,917
I'll take rye, bartender.

704
01:01:55,142 --> 01:01:56,427
Thanks, cash.

705
01:02:00,647 --> 01:02:02,137
But one thing more.

706
01:02:03,775 --> 01:02:06,858
Half my share in the mine belongs to you.

707
01:02:12,075 --> 01:02:13,781
If that's the way you want it.

708
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:25,331
Can we step into your office a minute,
judge?

709
01:02:27,424 --> 01:02:28,424
Indeed.

710
01:02:39,186 --> 01:02:41,552
I want you to arrange something for me,
judge.

711
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,345
I'll be glad to.

712
01:03:10,258 --> 01:03:11,258
Cummings.

713
01:03:16,056 --> 01:03:19,139
I'm part owner in Jeff Cameron's mine.

714
01:03:20,727 --> 01:03:23,469
That makes me part owner in the Wells.

715
01:03:24,648 --> 01:03:27,310
Got a herd on the way
to the railroad right now.

716
01:03:28,818 --> 01:03:32,231
They're going to water
at Jeff Cameron's Wells.

717
01:03:33,949 --> 01:03:34,949
Tonight.

718
01:03:36,826 --> 01:03:39,112
- What'll you have?
- Uh, small beer.

719
01:03:39,287 --> 01:03:40,823
Bartender. Small beer?

720
01:03:40,997 --> 01:03:41,997
Yes.

721
01:03:44,501 --> 01:03:46,583
"To cash holbrook."

722
01:03:47,921 --> 01:03:50,833
- Half interest?
- In my share.

723
01:04:13,363 --> 01:04:15,604
- Jeff Cameron here?
- Yes.

724
01:04:15,782 --> 01:04:17,067
I work for him, ma'am.

725
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:24,783
Sign it right there, my boy.

726
01:04:30,255 --> 01:04:31,255
Judge...

727
01:04:33,216 --> 01:04:35,207
I'd rather you'd give this to him.

728
01:04:40,473 --> 01:04:42,338
Well, how about the wedding?

729
01:04:42,517 --> 01:04:44,599
Don't you want him there?

730
01:04:44,769 --> 01:04:47,636
Sure I do, but he'd never come.

731
01:04:49,774 --> 01:04:52,186
I'll see you at the courthouse at 4:00.

732
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,975
All right, judge.

733
01:05:18,053 --> 01:05:19,053
Judge...

734
01:05:20,138 --> 01:05:24,131
I'm going to water beef tonight
at Cameron's well.

735
01:05:25,226 --> 01:05:27,638
Don't let nobody tell bill.

736
01:05:28,563 --> 01:05:30,428
It would only rile him.

737
01:05:36,363 --> 01:05:37,728
There goes trouble.

738
01:05:42,118 --> 01:05:43,324
Where is bill?

739
01:05:44,662 --> 01:05:45,742
He went out.

740
01:05:46,998 --> 01:05:48,989
=I'll find him. Wait a minute.

741
01:06:07,769 --> 01:06:11,227
Hello, Jeff. Glad you got in all right.

742
01:06:11,898 --> 01:06:14,731
It's the first time I've had a chance
to ask you about Mary Ellen.

743
01:06:15,610 --> 01:06:18,226
How's for your partner
being your son-in-law?

744
01:06:18,405 --> 01:06:19,690
You ain't my partner.

745
01:06:20,407 --> 01:06:23,365
You ain't never gonna be nothin' to me.

746
01:06:26,830 --> 01:06:28,570
What do you mean by that, Jeff?

747
01:06:29,124 --> 01:06:31,456
One thing I hate to admit to

748
01:06:31,626 --> 01:06:33,992
is being mistook in my judgment of a man.

749
01:06:34,796 --> 01:06:37,378
I've always told myself
you wasn't a holbrook.

750
01:06:38,174 --> 01:06:39,914
But you are.

751
01:06:40,093 --> 01:06:44,006
The thing you just done
proved it to me once and forever.

752
01:06:47,183 --> 01:06:48,343
The thing I just done?

753
01:06:48,518 --> 01:06:50,099
Sold me out to cash holbrook.

754
01:06:52,605 --> 01:06:54,596
But, Jeff, we were all through.

755
01:06:55,358 --> 01:06:57,849
Cash offered us help, and I took it.

756
01:06:58,027 --> 01:07:00,313
Of course you took it. Why not?

757
01:07:00,488 --> 01:07:02,444
You'd side with him against me

758
01:07:02,615 --> 01:07:05,857
and believe him when he lied
it was to help me.

759
01:07:06,035 --> 01:07:07,035
"Help me."

760
01:07:07,787 --> 01:07:11,279
He's been trying to get ahold of my Wells
ever since we split.

761
01:07:11,458 --> 01:07:13,574
Now he's done it, and you've helped him!

762
01:07:15,879 --> 01:07:17,961
- You're wrong, Jeff.
- Wrong?

763
01:07:18,590 --> 01:07:21,753
And him drivin' his cattle
in there tonight? Answer that.

764
01:07:24,179 --> 01:07:26,215
Say, how did you hear all this, Jeff?

765
01:07:26,389 --> 01:07:27,595
You ain't answered me yet.

766
01:07:27,765 --> 01:07:29,630
I said, how did you hear it?

767
01:07:29,809 --> 01:07:32,175
Rance Brett happened to be right there.

768
01:07:32,353 --> 01:07:33,593
You forgot that.

769
01:07:40,236 --> 01:07:41,271
Mary Ellen...

770
01:07:43,406 --> 01:07:45,818
You don't believe that I did anything.

771
01:08:02,592 --> 01:08:05,004
We all better be gettin' over
to the courthouse, Bob.

772
01:08:05,178 --> 01:08:06,884
It's almost time for the splicing.

773
01:08:09,641 --> 01:08:11,177
Might not be any.

774
01:08:13,937 --> 01:08:15,017
What's that?

775
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:20,060
Let's have a drink.

776
01:08:21,945 --> 01:08:23,355
No, thanks.

777
01:08:38,545 --> 01:08:41,412
Say, what are you gonna do, Jeff?

778
01:08:41,589 --> 01:08:43,545
Don't let Mary Ellen out of the house.

779
01:08:45,635 --> 01:08:50,925
Cash holbrook ain't gonna water no cattle
at Cameron's Wells tonight.

780
01:08:51,099 --> 01:08:52,839
Oh, you're gonna...

781
01:08:53,017 --> 01:08:54,928
Don't let Mary Ellen out of the house.

782
01:09:06,197 --> 01:09:08,529
I just started out to find you, bill.

783
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:09,700
Yeah?

784
01:09:12,829 --> 01:09:15,366
This fella Brett.
What about him?

785
01:09:16,332 --> 01:09:20,200
He just said something
that sounded sort of peculiar.

786
01:09:20,378 --> 01:09:21,378
What?

787
01:09:21,879 --> 01:09:26,213
Well, it wasn't so much what he said
as the way he said it.

788
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:28,719
Yeah?

789
01:09:32,140 --> 01:09:34,131
I've been waitin' for you, Kirby.

790
01:09:36,561 --> 01:09:40,554
We're going to water cattle
at Jeff Cameron's Wells tonight.

791
01:09:40,732 --> 01:09:42,472
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

792
01:09:43,443 --> 01:09:46,105
Well, I'll tell you what I just heard.

793
01:09:46,279 --> 01:09:47,894
Jeff's lookin' for you.

794
01:09:48,781 --> 01:09:50,612
- He is?
- Yeah.

795
01:09:50,783 --> 01:09:52,398
With a.44.

796
01:10:06,674 --> 01:10:10,838
Bob, I think you're right
about this fella Brett.

797
01:10:11,012 --> 01:10:12,343
I know I am.

798
01:10:13,848 --> 01:10:15,304
Is cash holbrook in the bar?

799
01:10:15,475 --> 01:10:16,475
No, he left.

800
01:10:17,143 --> 01:10:19,850
- Is Brett there?
- Yeah.

801
01:10:24,609 --> 01:10:27,021
Don't follow me in there too soon.

802
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:32,985
You wait here.

803
01:10:35,620 --> 01:10:37,986
We ain't leavin' town just yet.

804
01:10:39,791 --> 01:10:43,079
Well, he was in the silver dollar
a little while ago.

805
01:10:43,252 --> 01:10:44,252
Thanks.

806
01:10:47,006 --> 01:10:48,587
Now, Mary Ellen, don't you take on

807
01:10:48,758 --> 01:10:50,678
about something
you ain't got nothin' to do with.

808
01:10:50,760 --> 01:10:52,091
Open that gate.

809
01:10:52,261 --> 01:10:55,503
No, sirree Bob.
Jeff said you stay right here.

810
01:10:56,224 --> 01:10:58,590
Tonopah, you open that gate.

811
01:10:58,768 --> 01:10:59,848
No, sir!

812
01:11:02,480 --> 01:11:05,438
- Hello, cash.
- Hello, Jim.

813
01:11:06,109 --> 01:11:07,724
You lookin' for Jeff Cameron?

814
01:11:10,238 --> 01:11:11,569
Supposin'I am?

815
01:11:12,365 --> 01:11:13,445
Well...

816
01:11:15,159 --> 01:11:16,945
He's headed for the silver dollar.

817
01:11:21,582 --> 01:11:22,582
Thanks.

818
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:09,077
Brett?

819
01:12:09,630 --> 01:12:11,621
I've got something to settle with you.

820
01:12:21,267 --> 01:12:23,679
I never thought I'd have to kill a man.

821
01:12:24,687 --> 01:12:26,894
But it may be that I will.

822
01:12:28,691 --> 01:12:31,899
Brett, you're back of all this trouble.

823
01:12:33,029 --> 01:12:37,272
And what you've done may cost the lives
of two of the finest men on this earth.

824
01:12:38,493 --> 01:12:39,528
Now talk.

825
01:12:40,787 --> 01:12:43,028
Out loud, so everybody can hear you.

826
01:12:43,623 --> 01:12:45,579
And clear cash holbrook.

827
01:12:47,251 --> 01:12:49,412
If you lie to me, I'll know it.

828
01:12:50,922 --> 01:12:54,460
And, Brett, I'll kill you.

829
01:12:57,053 --> 01:12:59,965
All right, holbrook. Here it is.

830
01:13:01,098 --> 01:13:05,011
I did everything. Wagons, mine and all.

831
01:13:05,937 --> 01:13:07,723
And I'd do it again

832
01:13:07,897 --> 01:13:11,435
if you or any other man
come between me and what I want.

833
01:13:13,402 --> 01:13:14,402
That enough?

834
01:13:20,660 --> 01:13:22,366
Everybody hear that?

835
01:13:22,537 --> 01:13:23,617
I think so.

836
01:13:28,960 --> 01:13:30,040
Get movin'.

837
01:14:14,380 --> 01:14:16,917
I don't know which one of you
did that, but...

838
01:14:17,091 --> 01:14:18,922
You're both bad shots.

839
01:14:23,222 --> 01:14:26,180
Give me a hand with the boy,
will you, Jeff?

840
01:14:28,269 --> 01:14:30,055
You know I will, cash.

841
01:14:46,913 --> 01:14:48,244
Bill, what's happened?

842
01:14:48,414 --> 01:14:50,029
Only one thing.

843
01:14:55,421 --> 01:14:58,584
We're going to be a little bit late
at the courthouse, honey.
