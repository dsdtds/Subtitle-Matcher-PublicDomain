BENZ KONG, WONG MEI-MEI, KONG YUK-LAN

5
00:03:19,124 --> 00:03:21,334
- What's your name?
- Wai Chung.

6
00:03:23,253 --> 00:03:25,464
- How old are you?
- Twenty years old.

7
00:03:26,631 --> 00:03:28,842
- What do you do?
- Jobless.

8
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,220
That's 'unemployed'.

9
00:03:34,264 --> 00:03:36,975
- Where are you from?
- Canton, Toishan.

10
00:03:38,894 --> 00:03:40,353
Ruthless enough!

11
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,356
Came all the way to the north
to kill someone?

12
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:46,151
That's nothing, just killed one.

13
00:03:48,528 --> 00:03:52,991
I broke the law,
but I've got a chivalrous heart!

14
00:03:54,326 --> 00:03:57,996
Sir, have you heard of
Wong Fei-Hung from Canton?

15
00:03:58,163 --> 00:04:00,582
I've heard that he is a master
of Hung Fist.

16
00:04:01,416 --> 00:04:03,877
He's my auntie's cousin's cousin.

17
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:07,672
So I'm a bit chivalrous like him.

18
00:04:07,839 --> 00:04:10,592
When I see something I don't like,
I'LL beat them up!

19
00:04:12,427 --> 00:04:14,012
Sir, I just said Wong Fei-Hung—

20
00:04:14,179 --> 00:04:16,389
Take him in. The last one.

21
00:04:18,058 --> 00:04:20,018
Sir, how long do I stay here?

22
00:04:22,687 --> 00:04:25,440
The above sentenced you
to three years and eight months.

23
00:04:25,607 --> 00:04:26,399
So long!

24
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,781
Hey! The last one.

25
00:04:55,971 --> 00:04:57,973
- You've got to be kidding.
- Hey!

26
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,267
This kid's so bold to walk into that one.

27
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,144
Yeah. The old man
is really going to mess him up.

28
00:05:03,311 --> 00:05:04,271
Yeah.

29
00:05:22,122 --> 00:05:23,331
Damn old man.

30
00:05:39,764 --> 00:05:41,266
You've got skill!

31
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:55,989
Charge!

32
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:14,674
What the hell's that?

33
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:38,198
That's really something!

34
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:46,957
This kid's got guts.

35
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:55,256
I ain't done!

36
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:31,835
Hey, you still wanna mess with him?

37
00:07:32,002 --> 00:07:34,963
What if I do? Damn old man.

38
00:07:36,131 --> 00:07:37,590
Don't be so loud, be careful.

39
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,729
Hey, I'm telling you,
this old guy is a lunatic.

40
00:07:50,895 --> 00:07:52,856
He's already been sentenced to death.

41
00:07:53,023 --> 00:07:56,735
Whoever lives here that provokes him
will be unlucky.

42
00:07:57,318 --> 00:08:00,488
Why should I be afraid of him?
You don't know who you're dealing with.

43
00:08:00,655 --> 00:08:03,491
It's because I couldn't stand
wicked folks bullying others.

44
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:07,120
I beat him to death with two punches,
so I'm in this prison.

45
00:08:07,287 --> 00:08:09,247
Kid, aren't you afraid to die?

46
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,875
Afraid, my arse!

47
00:08:12,459 --> 00:08:16,629
Fine. If you have the guts,
just go over and sit on those stools.

48
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:18,381
All over there.

49
00:08:19,174 --> 00:08:21,134
He brought those stools in himself?

50
00:08:22,052 --> 00:08:23,511
He didn't exactly bring it in.

51
00:08:23,678 --> 00:08:27,891
But none of us guys
has ever dared to sit on those stools.

52
00:08:29,184 --> 00:08:31,019
You're all unworthy.

53
00:08:31,186 --> 00:08:34,147
Right, watch how 'uncle' does it.

54
00:09:08,223 --> 00:09:11,142
Old man, no one here
dares to sit on this stool.

55
00:09:11,309 --> 00:09:13,186
Uncle will, as you can see!

56
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,109
See! Both hands are steady!

57
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:29,828
Blow me, old man!

58
00:09:39,629 --> 00:09:41,089
There is something else!

59
00:09:51,599 --> 00:09:52,809
You broke my arse in half!

60
00:09:57,897 --> 00:09:58,857
Charge!

61
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,371
What? Think I can't sit firmly? Watch!

62
00:10:19,794 --> 00:10:20,753
Well?

63
00:10:28,928 --> 00:10:29,888
So comfortable!

64
00:10:33,683 --> 00:10:35,852
What's great about this? I can do it too!

65
00:10:41,316 --> 00:10:42,275
Can't sit down?

66
00:10:51,284 --> 00:10:54,162
Old man...! Have mercy on me!

67
00:10:54,329 --> 00:10:55,830
Old man, I give up!

68
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:15,808
Mr Ma, what is it?

69
00:11:15,975 --> 00:11:17,810
I'm letting you know

70
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,439
that I'm going to the execution ground
tomorrow morning.

71
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,274
You're really going there?

72
00:11:23,858 --> 00:11:28,446
Don't be concerned, it was inevitable.

73
00:11:28,613 --> 00:11:31,783
- I want to give you something now.
- What is it?

74
00:11:32,992 --> 00:11:33,952
Here.

75
00:11:34,869 --> 00:11:38,122
- This is—
- This piece of wood is only a half.

76
00:11:38,289 --> 00:11:40,583
After you get out of prison,

77
00:11:40,750 --> 00:11:44,212
you must do everything possible
to find the other half.

78
00:11:44,379 --> 00:11:45,672
The other half?

79
00:11:46,256 --> 00:11:51,719
Yes. Put the two pieces together
and you will understand the mystery.

80
00:11:55,640 --> 00:11:58,351
I like your stubborn
and brave personality.

81
00:11:58,518 --> 00:12:02,355
That's why I've no worries
about giving you this thing.

82
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:06,484
Young man, you must remember my words
and do this.

83
00:12:14,784 --> 00:12:18,746
Can you find treasures in prison?

84
00:13:30,985 --> 00:13:32,570
Hey! Slacking off?

85
00:13:32,737 --> 00:13:33,905
When have I been slacking?

86
00:13:34,489 --> 00:13:37,283
I saw you sit and look at a bit of wood!
Still denying it?

87
00:13:40,119 --> 00:13:41,704
Hey! Don't hit me!

88
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:43,956
Bring out the bit of wood on you,
bring it out!

89
00:13:44,123 --> 00:13:45,625
- Why?
- Bring it out!

90
00:13:45,792 --> 00:13:47,460
- Don't take it! Damn it!
- Hey...!

91
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:48,961
Won't bring it out?

92
00:13:49,128 --> 00:13:50,088
I won't!

93
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,469
Damn you!

94
00:13:57,053 --> 00:13:58,513
- Damn you!
- Drop dead!

95
00:13:58,679 --> 00:13:59,847
Damn you!

96
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:01,974
Damn you...!

97
00:14:11,401 --> 00:14:13,528
Hey! Stop that...!

98
00:14:13,694 --> 00:14:15,405
Stop! I'll shoot!

99
00:14:16,697 --> 00:14:20,326
Hey! Go! Go quickly! Ignore him, go!

100
00:15:13,838 --> 00:15:15,047
Come on, this way!

101
00:15:32,148 --> 00:15:35,067
- Hey, have you managed it?
- No, how about you?

102
00:15:35,234 --> 00:15:36,444
Of course not!

103
00:15:36,611 --> 00:15:39,071
- Then let's keep moving.
- All right.

104
00:15:41,866 --> 00:15:42,700
Hey...!

105
00:15:44,911 --> 00:15:47,455
- Hey, why drag me into the water?
- You dragged me in!

106
00:15:47,622 --> 00:15:50,958
- I'm going this way!
- I'm going that way!

107
00:15:57,757 --> 00:15:59,634
So which way shall we go?

108
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:03,095
- I say go east.
- Then I say go west.

109
00:16:03,262 --> 00:16:04,722
The west has a small path.

110
00:16:04,889 --> 00:16:07,850
Those chasing us will know
that we'll take that one.

111
00:16:08,017 --> 00:16:08,976
Then I'm sorry.

112
00:16:09,143 --> 00:16:12,480
I've only ever taken the small paths
in my life, never the main ones.

113
00:16:12,647 --> 00:16:14,857
All right, then let's go west.

114
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:29,247
Hey, you said to go west,
why won't you move?

115
00:16:29,413 --> 00:16:32,500
Sorry, I've changed my mind now.

116
00:16:32,667 --> 00:16:33,876
What?

117
00:16:34,043 --> 00:16:36,254
I want to go back, to the east.

118
00:16:37,505 --> 00:16:40,299
- Fine.
- Hey, don't keep following me.

119
00:16:41,175 --> 00:16:43,636
- What about this thing?
- There's a way.

120
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:46,764
- What's that?
- Hey, watch out!

121
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:49,809
Hey, what are you doing?

122
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:52,395
Breaking that iron chain.

123
00:16:52,562 --> 00:16:54,480
Hey, careful!

124
00:17:02,405 --> 00:17:04,407
- Are you dead?
- My arse!

125
00:17:11,455 --> 00:17:15,001
- Hey, think I'm a monkey?
- I want to turn you into a hairy crab!

126
00:17:22,133 --> 00:17:23,759
Don't you look like a tied-up crab?

127
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:30,057
- Look like your daddy!
- So, I'm your bitch?

128
00:18:18,648 --> 00:18:20,941
Trying to kill me? It hurts!

129
00:18:26,155 --> 00:18:27,114
Come on!

130
00:18:34,038 --> 00:18:35,915
Buddy, this is for real.

131
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:38,626
It's your own fault!

132
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:41,379
- So what should we do now?
- What do you mean?

133
00:18:41,545 --> 00:18:44,382
- Think of a way to get rid of the chain!
- All right.

134
00:18:44,548 --> 00:18:47,301
Right, let's go find a place now
and break this first.

135
00:18:52,682 --> 00:18:56,268
Coach, is the old man
you're looking for named Ma?

136
00:18:56,435 --> 00:18:57,395
Yes.

137
00:18:57,561 --> 00:19:00,022
- Is he blind in one eye?
- Correct.

138
00:19:01,315 --> 00:19:04,151
Coach, you're late.

139
00:19:04,318 --> 00:19:06,529
He was shot the day before yesterday.

140
00:19:13,035 --> 00:19:15,996
I don't know what business
Coach has with him?

141
00:19:18,499 --> 00:19:22,670
The upper commander ordered us
to do our best for Coach.

142
00:19:22,837 --> 00:19:25,673
Did he leave anything when he was dying?

143
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,634
- Leave something?
- Think hard.

144
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:29,760
Yes, Coach.

145
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,055
Is it the half piece of wood?

146
00:19:33,222 --> 00:19:35,433
That's right,
this is what I'm looking for.

147
00:19:35,599 --> 00:19:38,686
Then I know.
He gave it to a young prisoner.

148
00:19:38,853 --> 00:19:40,438
Where is this prisoner now?

149
00:19:40,604 --> 00:19:43,566
What a coincidence. He escaped yesterday.

150
00:19:46,485 --> 00:19:47,695
That's right.

151
00:19:47,862 --> 00:19:50,906
A new prisoner escaped with him.

152
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,243
Yes, there were still chains
on their feet at the time.

153
00:19:57,121 --> 00:19:59,081
Okay. We'll pursue them separately.

154
00:20:08,924 --> 00:20:11,594
Hey, this situation could use his help!

155
00:20:11,761 --> 00:20:13,888
Aren't you scared of him reporting us?

156
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:15,765
Think of a way! Go!

157
00:20:25,775 --> 00:20:29,111
- Hey, can you help us break a chain open?
- Money talks.

158
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:32,323
- What's the charge?
- Hammering a horseshoe is 15 coins.

159
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:34,950
Hammering a donkey's chain is 12 coins.

160
00:20:37,286 --> 00:20:39,747
Okay, whatever price. Just break it.

161
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:44,919
Is it a horseshoe or a donkey chain?

162
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,932
So you dudes are the escaped prisoners.

163
00:20:58,933 --> 00:21:01,769
It's okay to be a horseshoe,
and it's okay to be a donkey chain.

164
00:21:01,936 --> 00:21:02,895
Just name your price.

165
00:21:03,062 --> 00:21:04,647
Don't trouble me.

166
00:21:04,814 --> 00:21:09,401
I, Dai Ngau-Bing, am a good
and law-abiding, first-class citizen.

167
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:12,029
- I don't do anything sketchy.
- Is this sketchy?

168
00:21:12,947 --> 00:21:16,325
I let you go,
and the government will arrest me again.

169
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:17,952
Who are you kidding?

170
00:21:22,998 --> 00:21:25,668
Hey, I'm giving you business now.

171
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:26,627
I refuse.

172
00:21:26,794 --> 00:21:29,672
Hey! You see us suffering
but won't save us, what do you want?

173
00:21:32,758 --> 00:21:33,801
Are you leaving?

174
00:21:33,968 --> 00:21:36,428
You won't help us get this chain off,
we won't go.

175
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:37,721
You won't go?

176
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:55,447
Don't jump into the well!
Break our chain first!

177
00:22:00,744 --> 00:22:02,580
Nose...!

178
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:06,000
- Chest...
- Nose...!

179
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:06,959
Foot!

180
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,587
On your knees!

181
00:22:12,756 --> 00:22:13,716
Still not free!

182
00:22:14,884 --> 00:22:15,843
Thanks!

183
00:22:25,019 --> 00:22:25,978
Still not!

184
00:22:29,773 --> 00:22:30,566
Strike.

185
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:34,737
Look!

186
00:22:40,034 --> 00:22:41,493
Not been hit yet.

187
00:22:45,247 --> 00:22:46,206
You held it for me!

188
00:22:46,916 --> 00:22:48,375
I won't, then.

189
00:22:56,425 --> 00:22:57,384
Catch!

190
00:23:00,304 --> 00:23:02,514
- What is that?
- You know!

191
00:23:09,939 --> 00:23:11,273
There! You almost got it!

192
00:23:27,456 --> 00:23:28,415
That was a close one!

193
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:33,671
Not afraid of the heat?

194
00:23:42,471 --> 00:23:43,430
This way!

195
00:23:46,058 --> 00:23:47,685
My hand's here!

196
00:23:47,851 --> 00:23:49,311
This is the real deal!

197
00:24:09,623 --> 00:24:10,582
Hey!

198
00:24:19,383 --> 00:24:20,592
Catch!

199
00:24:27,391 --> 00:24:28,350
- Done!
- Go!

200
00:24:28,517 --> 00:24:29,601
Don't run!

201
00:24:42,281 --> 00:24:43,240
Go!

202
00:24:47,036 --> 00:24:47,911
NGAU'S BLACKSMITH

203
00:24:59,048 --> 00:25:01,467
Have you seen two fugitives
walking by here?

204
00:25:02,051 --> 00:25:04,219
You've come now to catch them;
it's too late.

205
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:06,889
Did you see them?

206
00:25:07,056 --> 00:25:09,892
Not only did I see them,
they messed up things here!

207
00:25:10,059 --> 00:25:12,144
Look! See how I am now.

208
00:25:12,311 --> 00:25:15,022
They also demolished my stall,
and ran off like horses!

209
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:19,401
- So where are they going now?
- How do I know?

210
00:25:21,195 --> 00:25:22,654
Did you see where they went?

211
00:25:24,573 --> 00:25:25,532
That way.

212
00:25:31,705 --> 00:25:33,332
We'll go west.

213
00:25:37,586 --> 00:25:40,047
Great...

214
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,216
Great!

215
00:25:42,382 --> 00:25:45,511
- Hey buddy, we'll have a fight now!
- What do you mean?

216
00:25:46,345 --> 00:25:49,056
You helped me break the chain
and I also broke yours.

217
00:25:49,223 --> 00:25:51,809
So you don't owe me,
and I don't owe you either.

218
00:25:51,975 --> 00:25:54,311
- Yeah.
- Then let's split up.

219
00:25:54,478 --> 00:25:55,813
So which way are you going?

220
00:25:55,979 --> 00:25:58,941
Anywhere besides your way. Goodbye!

221
00:26:01,235 --> 00:26:04,780
Also, don't follow me.
I'm just going to ignore you.

222
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:29,346
Very impressive.

223
00:26:29,513 --> 00:26:30,931
Thank you, everyone.

224
00:26:31,515 --> 00:26:32,766
Thank you...

225
00:26:33,475 --> 00:26:35,686
Tips, please.

226
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:37,479
- Job done!
- Tips, please.

227
00:26:37,646 --> 00:26:38,605
Thanks.

228
00:26:39,648 --> 00:26:41,984
- Thanks, sir.
- Thank you...! Thanks, everyone.

229
00:26:42,568 --> 00:26:44,027
- Thank you.
- Hold on!

230
00:26:45,529 --> 00:26:47,114
What advice do you have, sir?

231
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:52,119
You think you can make a name for yourself
with a few lousy tricks?

232
00:26:52,286 --> 00:26:53,745
Don't embarrass yourself.

233
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:57,624
We're a poor family
trying to make a living.

234
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:58,750
Please forgive us.

235
00:26:58,917 --> 00:27:02,629
You mix in this place
without giving me a piece of the action?

236
00:27:02,796 --> 00:27:04,756
You're in trouble!

237
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:08,177
Just leave your money
and get the hell out of here!

238
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:09,720
Well?

239
00:27:09,887 --> 00:27:12,347
Hey, don't force a tiger
to jump off the wall.

240
00:27:12,514 --> 00:27:14,224
Dare to fight me? Beat him!

241
00:27:41,585 --> 00:27:42,794
Damn punk, go to hell!

242
00:27:45,923 --> 00:27:48,133
Go to hell!

243
00:27:50,719 --> 00:27:52,679
Hold it! I'm coming.

244
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:02,689
Master!

245
00:29:01,999 --> 00:29:02,791
Master!

246
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:08,630
It's not about your small, lousy stall.

247
00:29:08,797 --> 00:29:11,967
I'd do the same to the big restaurant.

248
00:29:12,134 --> 00:29:13,093
You watch out!

249
00:29:18,056 --> 00:29:19,516
- Get lost!
- Go away!

250
00:29:24,354 --> 00:29:25,272
Master, you okay?

251
00:29:25,856 --> 00:29:28,150
Damn, even the monkey ran away.

252
00:29:28,317 --> 00:29:30,527
Pops, are you hurt badly?

253
00:29:30,694 --> 00:29:33,155
I don't care, but—

254
00:29:34,448 --> 00:29:35,407
This villain—

255
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:37,659
Don't be upset,
I'll vent your anger for you.

256
00:29:37,826 --> 00:29:40,162
- Leave everything to me.
- What?

257
00:29:40,746 --> 00:29:41,788
- You—
- That's right.

258
00:29:41,955 --> 00:29:43,790
I despise such wicked folk the most
in my life.

259
00:29:43,957 --> 00:29:47,502
I just escaped from prison.
That was because I killed a bad guy.

260
00:29:48,086 --> 00:29:51,298
Brother, how can I trouble you?

261
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:54,634
- All those bad guys ran away.
- Don't worry, they can't run far.

262
00:29:55,886 --> 00:29:57,721
- Call your boss out, quick!
- What for?

263
00:29:57,888 --> 00:30:00,640
- None of your business!
- Call him quick. Didn't you hear?

264
00:30:00,807 --> 00:30:01,850
Get your boss out now!

265
00:30:02,017 --> 00:30:04,936
What do you want to eat?
I'll get it for you. Why call the boss?

266
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,358
- You— Why are you hitting people?
- So what if we're hitting?

267
00:30:09,941 --> 00:30:12,235
- Don't let him hit you.
- What's the matter...?

268
00:30:12,819 --> 00:30:13,779
Out of the way!

269
00:30:14,363 --> 00:30:16,156
Sorry. Excuse us.

270
00:30:16,323 --> 00:30:19,242
Please have some respect.
Please sit down...

271
00:30:19,826 --> 00:30:20,786
Sit down...

272
00:30:22,245 --> 00:30:24,456
It's okay, everyone. Please have some tea.

273
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:29,252
Young Master Ma,
if something's up, let's talk it through.

274
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:31,505
If you won't pay
this month's protection fee,

275
00:30:31,671 --> 00:30:32,923
I'LL destroy your tea house.

276
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:35,300
- Here, pops, please come over.
- All right...

277
00:30:35,884 --> 00:30:36,843
Sit down.

278
00:30:37,010 --> 00:30:39,388
- Three? What would you like?
- A catty of dry wine.

279
00:30:39,554 --> 00:30:42,224
- What else?
- Five-spice beef, drunken chicken,

280
00:30:42,391 --> 00:30:45,352
poached meat, stir-fried
triple delicacies, 'a double crunch'.

281
00:30:46,395 --> 00:30:48,021
Also ten steamed buns, right away.

282
00:30:48,188 --> 00:30:49,147
Yes.

283
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:52,609
Right, I'LL have a full meal
with you today.

284
00:30:52,776 --> 00:30:55,237
Brother, you've ordered so many dishes—

285
00:30:56,154 --> 00:30:57,322
Don't you worry.

286
00:30:57,489 --> 00:31:00,992
You don't need to pay, nor do I.

287
00:31:01,159 --> 00:31:02,244
So who'll pay?

288
00:31:02,411 --> 00:31:05,372
- Someone'll certainly pay.
- All right.

289
00:31:05,539 --> 00:31:07,874
Young Master Ma, take your time.

290
00:31:08,041 --> 00:31:09,501
I'LL give the money in a while.

291
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:13,088
Now, if you still don't give me ten taels
after we've eaten,

292
00:31:13,255 --> 00:31:16,216
- don't blame me for being uncivil.
- Of course...

293
00:31:34,943 --> 00:31:35,902
Cheers.

294
00:31:37,821 --> 00:31:38,780
Thanks.

295
00:31:40,490 --> 00:31:42,534
- Who are you?
- Your mum's bed buddy!

296
00:31:42,701 --> 00:31:43,660
What?

297
00:31:46,329 --> 00:31:47,289
Have another cup.

298
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:09,060
- Boss... no need to pay!
- What is it?

299
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:11,271
Look, some kid's beating that bastard up!

300
00:32:34,503 --> 00:32:36,838
- What do you want?
- Take care of your little cock!

301
00:32:38,256 --> 00:32:39,466
Easy!

302
00:32:39,633 --> 00:32:40,800
That one!

303
00:32:53,271 --> 00:32:54,523
Pops, take your time eating.

304
00:32:56,942 --> 00:32:58,026
So you're helping them?

305
00:32:58,610 --> 00:33:01,571
Your mum wants to marry;
the man's getting in there early!

306
00:33:23,051 --> 00:33:26,137
This kid fights so brilliantly!
You'll save money this time, boss!

307
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,515
Yes, but my tea house
is about to be demolished!

308
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:46,283
Sorry...! It wasn't me!

309
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:50,370
Another noodle bowl of mine smashed!

310
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,099
Good hit!

311
00:34:11,975 --> 00:34:13,435
Pops, drink up...! Come on...!

312
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:20,191
Flying saucer!

313
00:34:23,570 --> 00:34:24,529
Catch!

314
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:27,657
Hey, wanna castrate me?

315
00:34:28,241 --> 00:34:30,744
With a son like you,
you should've been aborted ages ago.

316
00:34:46,426 --> 00:34:47,385
My tea leaves!

317
00:34:47,552 --> 00:34:48,887
There goes another one!

318
00:35:16,498 --> 00:35:17,916
We're on the same side...!

319
00:35:26,675 --> 00:35:27,926
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

320
00:35:31,638 --> 00:35:33,348
So many more things broken!

321
00:35:34,641 --> 00:35:35,600
Hey...!

322
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,727
Even the waiter's been knocked dizzy!

323
00:35:38,311 --> 00:35:39,270
I'm not dizzy!

324
00:35:46,403 --> 00:35:47,362
Here!

325
00:35:49,531 --> 00:35:51,324
- My wine!
- Take it back!

326
00:36:02,711 --> 00:36:03,670
Pops, take it all!

327
00:36:07,215 --> 00:36:08,258
You wanna rob me?

328
00:36:11,177 --> 00:36:14,013
Not robbery,
it's so you accumulate secret virtue.

329
00:36:32,699 --> 00:36:33,908
My Cock!

330
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,787
- Master, I think he's great!
- Bravo!

331
00:36:38,663 --> 00:36:39,622
Hey, catch!

332
00:36:42,792 --> 00:36:43,752
Bravo...!

333
00:36:44,335 --> 00:36:46,045
Guest, your kung fu is superb!

334
00:36:46,212 --> 00:36:47,922
Helped me knock him down!

335
00:36:48,089 --> 00:36:49,591
That's nothing!

336
00:36:49,758 --> 00:36:51,676
Here! My reward to you!

337
00:36:52,761 --> 00:36:54,220
My shop!

338
00:36:54,804 --> 00:36:58,892
Sure! All right, I'LL give you half
to renovate this shop. Fair?

339
00:36:59,476 --> 00:37:00,935
Fair...

340
00:37:03,229 --> 00:37:04,189
Thanks.

341
00:37:15,492 --> 00:37:16,451
Follow him.

342
00:37:56,282 --> 00:37:58,076
Pal, do you want money?

343
00:37:58,243 --> 00:38:00,245
At most, we'll all share it.

344
00:38:00,411 --> 00:38:02,747
Thanks, we're not asking for money.

345
00:38:03,331 --> 00:38:04,457
Are you after my life?

346
00:38:04,624 --> 00:38:07,585
No, not your life.

347
00:38:08,169 --> 00:38:10,004
Then... what do you want?

348
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:12,131
To search your body.

349
00:38:13,341 --> 00:38:14,634
What? No way.

350
00:38:32,819 --> 00:38:33,862
Split and pursue!

351
00:39:12,567 --> 00:39:14,694
- Why are you searching me?
- Let me ask you,

352
00:39:14,861 --> 00:39:17,155
did the old man give you something?

353
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,281
So what?

354
00:39:21,534 --> 00:39:22,702
- Give it quick!
- No way!

355
00:39:48,561 --> 00:39:49,896
It's you?

356
00:39:51,189 --> 00:39:52,148
Get them!

357
00:39:58,321 --> 00:40:00,281
- What is your relationship?
- Relatives.

358
00:40:04,661 --> 00:40:06,079
- What relatives?
- My bitch.

359
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:08,289
Your bitch?

360
00:41:05,263 --> 00:41:06,222
Block fast!

361
00:41:11,352 --> 00:41:13,604
- You handle these three pushovers!
- Hey, wait—

362
00:41:26,117 --> 00:41:27,076
After him!

363
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:44,218
Smart arse, you abandoned me...

364
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:50,725
I really didn't accumulate virtue
in my last life, always running into you.

365
00:41:50,892 --> 00:41:53,853
Hey, don't be so ungrateful.

366
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:56,314
I just saved you.

367
00:41:56,481 --> 00:41:57,440
Really?

368
00:42:01,861 --> 00:42:04,614
But you pass the toilet paper
when someone is peeing.

369
00:42:04,781 --> 00:42:06,616
- A useless gesture!
- What?

370
00:42:07,784 --> 00:42:08,993
To be honest,

371
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:12,455
even if you hadn't arrived just then,
I would've knocked them down!

372
00:42:13,039 --> 00:42:14,749
- You...!
- Don't you agree?

373
00:42:16,542 --> 00:42:17,543
Smart arse,

374
00:42:17,710 --> 00:42:21,005
you think you can beat the world
with that one-and-a-half strokes?

375
00:42:22,090 --> 00:42:25,218
Hang on! This young master
has his own magic weapon.

376
00:42:25,384 --> 00:42:26,469
I have a bright future.

377
00:42:26,636 --> 00:42:28,179
What's this special thing?

378
00:42:28,346 --> 00:42:32,058
Can't tell you. I'll leave you itching.

379
00:42:32,225 --> 00:42:34,310
Right. We'll split.

380
00:42:37,980 --> 00:42:39,398
I warn you again,

381
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:43,277
stop stalking me like a ghost
all the time.

382
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:55,206
- Pops, where can I find an inn?
- Behind me.

383
00:43:05,967 --> 00:43:11,013
'The wok steam smell permeates the air.'

384
00:43:13,724 --> 00:43:18,312
'The roar of the cannons
inspires fear in all directions.'

385
00:43:21,858 --> 00:43:24,193
- Come in...!
- Hey! What are you doing?

386
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,863
Don't be shy, young master.
Time for a midnight snack.

387
00:43:27,029 --> 00:43:28,990
I'm full.

388
00:43:29,157 --> 00:43:31,117
- Come on in!
- Hey...!

389
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:33,077
There!

390
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:37,290
This is true steaming!

391
00:43:37,874 --> 00:43:40,835
- Come this way.
- What are you doing? Let go!

392
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:42,128
Come on, come this way.

393
00:43:44,755 --> 00:43:46,215
What the hell?

394
00:43:47,175 --> 00:43:48,134
Let gm!

395
00:43:48,301 --> 00:43:50,511
- She's trying to steal him from me.
- He's mine!

396
00:43:50,678 --> 00:43:51,721
Stop fighting...!

397
00:43:51,888 --> 00:43:53,598
Let me take care of him.

398
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:56,058
- Young master, please come in.
- What?

399
00:43:56,225 --> 00:43:57,185
Come in.

400
00:43:57,351 --> 00:43:59,979
I said no.
I'm looking for an inn to rest.

401
00:44:00,146 --> 00:44:02,857
Perfect! This is even better
than an inn for resting!

402
00:44:03,649 --> 00:44:06,736
Young master, you're such a handsome boy!
Like a real gentleman!

403
00:44:06,903 --> 00:44:08,779
Let me find you a true beauty!

404
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:12,617
- What do you mean?
- A pretty, young kung fu girl for you!

405
00:44:12,783 --> 00:44:15,494
- Kung fu?
- First-class, but a bit more expensive.

406
00:44:15,661 --> 00:44:17,997
- How much does it cost?
- Three taels.

407
00:44:18,164 --> 00:44:20,791
- You gotta be kidding me!
- A trifle! Come on!

408
00:44:22,043 --> 00:44:23,002
Come in.

409
00:44:23,586 --> 00:44:26,047
Sweetie, a young man has come here.

410
00:44:27,965 --> 00:44:30,885
Right, this girl is our royal best!

411
00:44:31,052 --> 00:44:32,261
Not bad, right?

412
00:44:37,099 --> 00:44:40,019
Look at you,
you feel dizzy when you look at her!

413
00:44:40,186 --> 00:44:42,146
How will you handle it later?

414
00:44:43,189 --> 00:44:45,399
Sweetie, you must take good care of him.

415
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:20,810
Please pay UP-

416
00:45:20,977 --> 00:45:21,936
That quickly?

417
00:45:31,070 --> 00:45:32,029
Here.

418
00:45:34,031 --> 00:45:35,741
This is one tael,

419
00:45:35,908 --> 00:45:36,867
two are missing.

420
00:45:37,743 --> 00:45:39,954
How are you worth three, sweetheart?

421
00:45:40,538 --> 00:45:42,707
You agreed on the price
before you came in.

422
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:46,711
Yes, but the old witch said
you're excellent in kung fu.

423
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:48,963
In fact, it's far from it!

424
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:51,465
I don't know how my kung fu is.

425
00:45:51,632 --> 00:45:55,511
But people who don't give enough money
never get out of my bed.

426
00:45:56,387 --> 00:45:58,597
God damn girl, stop bluffing.

427
00:45:59,765 --> 00:46:00,725
Hold it.

428
00:46:00,891 --> 00:46:04,103
Hey, don't make me angry,
I'll slap you a couple of times.

429
00:46:04,270 --> 00:46:06,480
- Where will you slap me?
- You bitch!

430
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:12,153
- I said you'll never get out of bed.
- Make me show you my skill?

431
00:46:16,782 --> 00:46:18,034
Have a taste of this.

432
00:46:24,165 --> 00:46:27,543
As I said: no pay, no leaving the bed.

433
00:46:30,588 --> 00:46:32,548
The old witch said your kung fu was great.

434
00:46:32,715 --> 00:46:34,967
- So, she was just referring to this?
- How kind.

435
00:46:35,134 --> 00:46:36,510
Bloody bitch.

436
00:46:52,068 --> 00:46:54,487
- I've never fought in bed.
- I'll give you a taste.

437
00:46:57,198 --> 00:46:58,407
See what tricks you have!

438
00:47:02,536 --> 00:47:03,913
Have you tried this trick?

439
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:07,041
- Is it 'Buddha Sitting on the Lotus'?
- So you have tried it?

440
00:47:15,091 --> 00:47:17,843
- Still missing two taels, will you pay?
- I won't!

441
00:47:19,428 --> 00:47:21,847
Can't get out of bed yet. Come back!

442
00:47:23,349 --> 00:47:25,309
- Do you still want it again?
- Go to hell!

443
00:47:26,602 --> 00:47:27,561
Still wanna escape?

444
00:47:40,741 --> 00:47:42,576
You resemble a steamed rice dumpling!

445
00:47:47,832 --> 00:47:49,417
You look like a rice dumpling now!

446
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,759
Incoming!

447
00:48:10,438 --> 00:48:11,981
You bastard!

448
00:48:12,148 --> 00:48:15,651
Trying to freeload?
The kung fu chick really took care of you!

449
00:48:17,903 --> 00:48:19,572
Still not enough!

450
00:48:20,865 --> 00:48:23,993
Hey, my tables and chairs are all broken!
You better pay!

451
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:26,495
- Pay what? I'm out of money.
- What's that?

452
00:48:26,662 --> 00:48:29,540
How dare you come to a brothel
with no money!

453
00:48:30,416 --> 00:48:33,878
Then you better frickin' make up for it.
Stand up straight, everyone!

454
00:48:34,044 --> 00:48:35,421
Hurry up! Here!

455
00:48:37,006 --> 00:48:37,965
So what is this?

456
00:48:38,132 --> 00:48:40,676
To get out of the door,
you must go via these crotches.

457
00:48:40,843 --> 00:48:43,554
- How can I live with that?
- Who told you not to bring enough money?

458
00:48:43,721 --> 00:48:44,680
Then I—

459
00:48:45,473 --> 00:48:46,432
Wait and see!

460
00:48:47,016 --> 00:48:48,851
- It'll be a good show this time!
- Yeah!

461
00:48:49,435 --> 00:48:52,396
Won't you crawl?
If not, I'll ask them to kick your arse.

462
00:48:53,689 --> 00:48:55,274
You bastard, let me tell you.

463
00:48:55,441 --> 00:48:57,902
All my girls know two sets of kung fu!

464
00:48:58,068 --> 00:48:59,695
You scared now?

465
00:48:59,862 --> 00:49:03,407
So... I have no choice.
'The tiger falls to Ping yang.'

466
00:49:03,574 --> 00:49:04,783
I'LL do it.

467
00:49:07,745 --> 00:49:08,704
Come on.

468
00:49:09,955 --> 00:49:10,915
Come on.

469
00:49:12,458 --> 00:49:14,835
- Are you for real?
- That's right...!

470
00:49:15,878 --> 00:49:17,087
Can't I crawl like this?

471
00:49:18,339 --> 00:49:20,925
- That won't do!
- How about it?

472
00:49:21,091 --> 00:49:22,551
Crawl like a dog!

473
00:49:23,802 --> 00:49:25,638
I don't believe in these superstitions.

474
00:49:26,222 --> 00:49:27,556
I follow no forbidden rules.

475
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:31,060
Serves you right!

476
00:49:45,324 --> 00:49:47,117
Damned fat cow, wanna kill me?

477
00:49:47,284 --> 00:49:49,328
Let me tell you,
business has been bad lately.

478
00:49:49,495 --> 00:49:51,580
I'll let you have a taste of my bad luck!

479
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:55,042
Hey, my back!

480
00:49:55,209 --> 00:49:57,586
- It hurts!
- Transfer it to you...!

481
00:49:57,753 --> 00:49:59,255
Go now, son!

482
00:50:01,423 --> 00:50:04,093
Go away, quickly!

483
00:50:04,677 --> 00:50:07,721
- Fucking bitches!
- Get out! Get out now!

484
00:50:07,888 --> 00:50:10,099
- Never seen anyone like him before.
- Yeah!

485
00:50:15,020 --> 00:50:15,980
Fucking bitches!

486
00:50:37,751 --> 00:50:39,211
Damn! I'm in deep shit.

487
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,721
Hey pal, you're blocking my way.

488
00:50:48,887 --> 00:50:51,307
Unless you take out
the piece of wood on you.

489
00:50:51,890 --> 00:50:53,434
What? Bring it out for you?

490
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:58,063
- If not, don't think you can leave town.
- Fight if you've the guts!

491
00:50:59,064 --> 00:51:01,150
More fighting? No way!

492
00:51:01,317 --> 00:51:04,987
I had my kicks in there. I'm all swollen!

493
00:51:05,154 --> 00:51:07,615
Then my men won't have to work too hard.

494
00:51:43,275 --> 00:51:45,778
- My arse!
- Smart arse, soft feet, yeah?

495
00:51:47,237 --> 00:51:49,990
Soft feet? I'll be looking
for your sister in a while!

496
00:52:50,801 --> 00:52:51,760
Hey, watch out!

497
00:52:58,851 --> 00:53:00,060
Got it!

498
00:53:00,227 --> 00:53:01,562
Pat the pig's head!

499
00:53:01,729 --> 00:53:02,938
Stewed trotters!

500
00:53:13,574 --> 00:53:14,533
Let me handle it.

501
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,884
Your Nine-Pass Flower Stick's
pretty powerful.

502
00:53:32,050 --> 00:53:34,595
You deserved that!
Who told you to constantly pester me?

503
00:53:49,777 --> 00:53:52,863
You nobodies dare to oppose me?
Buy your coffins first!

504
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:54,531
I have no beef with you!

505
00:53:55,115 --> 00:53:57,743
You took that piece of wood,
so that makes you my enemy.

506
00:54:20,307 --> 00:54:24,937
Countless people have died under my stick,
but I don't want you to die here today.

507
00:54:35,823 --> 00:54:37,658
I'LL beat you up like a dog now.

508
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,439
After him!

509
00:55:24,496 --> 00:55:26,331
They couldn't have gone far. Split up!

510
00:55:26,498 --> 00:55:27,457
Right!

511
00:55:45,434 --> 00:55:49,146
Talk quick! Why do you always follow him
in want of that piece of wood?

512
00:55:49,313 --> 00:55:50,731
- I can't say.
- Why not?

513
00:55:50,898 --> 00:55:52,399
Why are you always following me?

514
00:55:52,566 --> 00:55:53,525
Talk...

515
00:55:53,692 --> 00:55:57,321
- If you don't talk, I'LL tear you apart!
- I'LL gouge your eyes out!

516
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:02,284
I'LL talk. 25 years ago, Black Tiger clan
and Tongbei school were rivals.

517
00:56:02,451 --> 00:56:04,077
In fighting for their reputations,

518
00:56:04,244 --> 00:56:08,332
Tung Gam-Hong of the Black Tiger gang
and Ma Siu-Tin of the Tongbei school

519
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:11,460
both met on the Changbai Mountain edge,
in a fight to the death.

520
00:57:09,518 --> 00:57:13,230
Our master of the Black Tiger gang
killed that of the Tongbei school.

521
00:57:14,189 --> 00:57:18,235
The master of the Tongbei school
was blinded in one eye by him.

522
00:57:18,402 --> 00:57:21,571
The only son of the Gang — Tung Hak-Fung —
wants to avenge his father.

523
00:57:21,738 --> 00:57:24,700
All these years,
he's been practising and getting ready.

524
00:57:26,243 --> 00:57:28,120
I'm not from Tongbei.
Why drag me into this?

525
00:57:28,704 --> 00:57:32,749
Our big brother was looking
for Old Man Ma because he had a rare book.

526
00:57:32,916 --> 00:57:34,334
Old Man Ma died in the prison.

527
00:57:34,501 --> 00:57:37,587
- But he gave it to you.
- Hence you're on this pursuit to kill me!

528
00:57:37,754 --> 00:57:40,257
I'LL catch you one day
and get the half piece of wood.

529
00:57:40,424 --> 00:57:42,384
Wait! Don't do anything to him.

530
00:57:45,554 --> 00:57:47,305
Stand up! Get lost!

531
00:57:49,433 --> 00:57:51,893
- What? You're letting him go?
- That's right.

532
00:57:52,060 --> 00:57:54,771
Because I want him to deliver a message
to Tung Hak-Fung.

533
00:57:56,898 --> 00:57:59,026
Right! Tell Tung Hak-Fung,

534
00:57:59,192 --> 00:58:01,528
our Tongbei school
may have been beaten by yours,

535
00:58:01,695 --> 00:58:04,489
but we'll crush you scum eventually.

536
00:58:04,656 --> 00:58:05,866
Get going now!

537
00:58:07,701 --> 00:58:08,660
Move!

538
00:58:15,709 --> 00:58:17,753
How about you?
Why do you keep pestering me?

539
00:58:23,216 --> 00:58:27,512
Maybe I'm the same as Tung Hak-Fung,
interested in the half piece on you.

540
00:58:28,096 --> 00:58:30,140
What? So you also mean me harm?

541
00:58:30,307 --> 00:58:31,600
- No.
- What, then?

542
00:58:31,767 --> 00:58:34,478
- Because I have the other half on me.
- What did you say?

543
00:58:38,065 --> 00:58:41,902
Really? Old Ma told me to search the world
to find the other half piece of wood.

544
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:43,153
So it's in your hands.

545
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,447
So now you know
why I pester you all the time.

546
00:58:45,614 --> 00:58:46,698
I set it!

547
00:58:46,865 --> 00:58:48,575
Bring out that half now.

548
00:58:51,995 --> 00:58:55,957
- What are the words?
- Changbai Peak, Tiger Ridge.

549
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:21,233
Hey, what are you doing sleeping here?

550
00:59:21,817 --> 00:59:23,527
I'm so tired.

551
00:59:24,653 --> 00:59:26,863
What? So you're tired?

552
00:59:27,906 --> 00:59:30,242
Pal, it's been three days
and three nights.

553
00:59:30,408 --> 00:59:31,868
How can I not be tired?

554
00:59:38,500 --> 00:59:39,709
Hey, what do you want now?

555
00:59:40,919 --> 00:59:43,755
Keep going, find the destination first.

556
00:59:46,174 --> 00:59:47,884
Hey, I have steamed buns in it.

557
00:59:48,051 --> 00:59:49,761
- Hungry again?
- Of course.

558
00:59:49,928 --> 00:59:50,887
Sure.

559
00:59:52,681 --> 00:59:56,434
Right. Eat whilst walking.

560
00:59:56,601 --> 00:59:58,311
- Eat before leaving.
- No.

561
01:00:18,957 --> 01:00:19,916
Come on...!

562
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,809
Come on...! Hey, eat it...!

563
01:01:04,377 --> 01:01:05,754
This is Black Tiger Ridge.

564
01:01:08,089 --> 01:01:09,049
Hey!

565
01:01:11,051 --> 01:01:13,261
- Look, that hole over there!
- Let's go in!

566
01:01:17,724 --> 01:01:18,516
Sin Ha Cave!

567
01:01:57,639 --> 01:02:00,141
They said there was something here.
Not a damn thing!

568
01:02:00,308 --> 01:02:02,394
Stop blaming, kiddo.

569
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:04,854
I'm not blaming,
I've walked such a long way.

570
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:06,481
We'll stay here tonight.

571
01:02:11,319 --> 01:02:12,779
It's here!

572
01:02:16,074 --> 01:02:20,328
Oh yeah, I haven't asked you yet,
where did you get the half of your wood?

573
01:02:20,495 --> 01:02:22,664
It was given to me
when my master was dying.

574
01:02:22,831 --> 01:02:24,666
Your master? Who is he?

575
01:02:24,833 --> 01:02:28,128
He was the brother of the old man
in the prison.

576
01:02:30,755 --> 01:02:33,049
I see. So you...

577
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:34,175
That's right.

578
01:02:36,845 --> 01:02:39,180
I deliberately broke the law
and went to prison.

579
01:02:39,347 --> 01:02:42,058
The purpose was to take the half piece
to Old Man Ma.

580
01:02:42,225 --> 01:02:45,812
But I didn't expect that he'd be shot
the day I went in.

581
01:02:46,855 --> 01:02:51,818
It was unexpected and coincidental the day
at the mine when I saw it in your hands.

582
01:02:51,985 --> 01:02:54,154
So I kept pestering you.

583
01:02:54,321 --> 01:02:57,198
What was the use of pestering?
I thought I was lucky.

584
01:02:57,365 --> 01:02:59,576
Now, just plain unlucky.

585
01:03:03,955 --> 01:03:05,957
Hey, look.

586
01:03:44,537 --> 01:03:47,248
The founder of the Tongbei school
was Wong Yau-San.

587
01:03:47,415 --> 01:03:51,127
Devoting a lifetime, he lived in seclusion
in Changbai Mountain for six years,

588
01:03:51,294 --> 01:03:52,962
extracting the essence of an ape

589
01:03:53,129 --> 01:03:56,132
and studied the power of Eight Extremes
in order to create this.

590
01:03:56,299 --> 01:03:59,135
To practice Tongbei Fist,
we must first start with wrist strength

591
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:00,512
and arm strength.

592
01:04:16,820 --> 01:04:17,779
Waist strength.

593
01:04:32,210 --> 01:04:33,169
Keen eyesight.

594
01:04:36,339 --> 01:04:37,298
Abdominal muscles.

595
01:04:45,723 --> 01:04:46,683
Neck strength.

596
01:04:53,064 --> 01:04:54,023
Leg strength.

597
01:05:24,721 --> 01:05:27,849
Consolidate the foundation
of internal and external kung fu.

598
01:05:28,016 --> 01:05:31,728
Having the will to guide the air,
use the air to exert strength.

599
01:05:31,895 --> 01:05:34,939
Emphasise softness and rigidity
with long arms.

600
01:05:35,106 --> 01:05:37,817
When you move,
you can change your arms.

601
01:07:08,241 --> 01:07:10,952
Look at you, eating so fast.

602
01:07:11,119 --> 01:07:13,079
You aren't as diligent when practising.

603
01:07:13,246 --> 01:07:16,040
What? You say I'm lazy when practising?

604
01:07:16,207 --> 01:07:17,709
Are you not wrong?

605
01:07:17,875 --> 01:07:21,087
Not wrong at all.
How much have you learn now?

606
01:07:22,297 --> 01:07:24,841
Right. Tongbei water and fire,
Tongbei link,

607
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:26,926
Tongbei arms, Tongbei—

608
01:07:27,093 --> 01:07:29,304
Tongbei drunken ape,
have you learn that?

609
01:07:30,555 --> 01:07:32,265
I haven't learn this technique yet.

610
01:07:32,432 --> 01:07:33,641
You haven't learnt...

611
01:07:34,726 --> 01:07:35,852
Unless you did?

612
01:07:36,769 --> 01:07:38,313
A little bit.

613
01:07:51,534 --> 01:07:53,995
If you did, show me see a few moves.

614
01:07:54,579 --> 01:07:55,538
Well?

615
01:07:56,122 --> 01:07:58,374
Don't know, or haven't learn it?

616
01:08:01,127 --> 01:08:05,006
'The white drunken ape descends the hill.'

617
01:08:05,173 --> 01:08:07,884
'Dances around the flowers
and shakes about'.

618
01:08:09,552 --> 01:08:12,847
'The white drunken ape descends the hill.'

619
01:08:18,061 --> 01:08:24,525
The white... drunken ape... descends the hill.

620
01:08:31,949 --> 01:08:35,411
'Dances around the flowers
and shakes about, drinking and singing.'

621
01:08:35,578 --> 01:08:42,251
Dances around the flowers
and shakes about, drinking and singing.

622
01:08:43,836 --> 01:08:48,174
'Jumping tiger and flying swallows
shake their fans gently.'

623
01:08:48,341 --> 01:08:51,719
Jumping tiger and flying swallows
shake their fans gently.

624
01:08:51,886 --> 01:08:55,098
'Shaking your head.
Fool around in the human world.'

625
01:08:55,264 --> 01:09:00,436
Shaking your head.
Fool around in the human world.

626
01:09:00,603 --> 01:09:03,564
'Born to spread flowers
and steal peaches.'

627
01:09:22,083 --> 01:09:25,044
'Sleepwalk in the King's Pond.
Stand straight like an Immortal.'

628
01:09:43,855 --> 01:09:46,315
'Flying between clouds in the sky,
reaching nirvana.'

629
01:09:53,990 --> 01:09:56,951
'Rolling body and chopping the drunken man
from the Tang dynasty.'

630
01:10:00,037 --> 01:10:02,540
'Golden hook hanging upside down
in the Immortal style.'

631
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,261
'The smart Tongbei ape
hides the water and fire.'

632
01:10:32,153 --> 01:10:34,614
'The hungry ape hunts
like a tiger in the mountain.'

633
01:10:52,298 --> 01:10:55,051
'Spreading arms and legs
like a phoenix spreading her wings.'

634
01:11:06,187 --> 01:11:08,439
'Like winds and anchors,
or a needle in the ocean.'

635
01:11:15,530 --> 01:11:18,449
'White ape guards the Nine Provinces
with water and fire.'

636
01:11:45,101 --> 01:11:46,060
Wai Chung!

637
01:11:47,520 --> 01:11:48,479
Wai Chung!

638
01:11:54,485 --> 01:11:56,445
Where has that guy gone so early?

639
01:11:56,612 --> 01:11:58,322
- One,

640
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:00,741
two,

641
01:12:02,034 --> 01:12:02,994
three,

642
01:12:05,204 --> 01:12:06,372
four,

643
01:12:07,206 --> 01:12:08,165
five,

644
01:12:09,792 --> 01:12:10,751
six,

645
01:12:12,295 --> 01:12:13,588
seven,

646
01:12:13,754 --> 01:12:15,715
eight, nine,

647
01:12:16,299 --> 01:12:17,758
ten,

648
01:12:17,925 --> 01:12:19,886
eleven,

649
01:12:20,052 --> 01:12:21,470
twelve,

650
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:23,347
thirteen,

651
01:12:23,931 --> 01:12:25,641
fourteen,

652
01:12:26,225 --> 01:12:27,852
fifteen.

653
01:12:28,436 --> 01:12:30,146
Sixteen,

654
01:12:30,730 --> 01:12:32,356
seventeen,

655
01:12:32,940 --> 01:12:34,775
eighteen,

656
01:12:34,942 --> 01:12:36,611
nineteen,

657
01:12:37,194 --> 01:12:38,863
twenty.

658
01:12:39,447 --> 01:12:41,073
Twenty-one,

659
01:12:41,240 --> 01:12:42,116
twenty-two,

660
01:12:43,326 --> 01:12:45,036
twenty-three,

661
01:12:46,203 --> 01:12:47,914
twenty-four,

662
01:12:48,956 --> 01:12:50,666
Twenty-five,

663
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:54,670
- Hey, what are you standing there for?
- No reason.

664
01:12:54,837 --> 01:12:56,297
If no reason, get the hell out!

665
01:12:56,464 --> 01:12:58,549
- Can't I look?
- No.

666
01:13:05,598 --> 01:13:08,559
Hey punk,
what the hell are you doing here?

667
01:13:08,726 --> 01:13:10,436
This is a martial arts school.

668
01:13:10,603 --> 01:13:13,147
Yeah, I didn't say
that you were a funeral home here.

669
01:13:14,607 --> 01:13:15,816
So insolent.

670
01:13:15,983 --> 01:13:17,818
Are you not afraid to die?

671
01:13:17,985 --> 01:13:19,612
If I were, would I be standing here?

672
01:13:19,779 --> 01:13:21,739
- Fool.
- You...

673
01:13:25,493 --> 01:13:27,703
Coach, he must be an enemy.

674
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,331
Yes, he must be here to rob Master.

675
01:13:30,498 --> 01:13:32,708
Damn, all my stuff was stolen by him.

676
01:13:36,879 --> 01:13:39,090
- Stop him immediately.
- Right!

677
01:13:40,007 --> 01:13:40,967
You can't leave yet!

678
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:44,971
What's this?
You want me to stay here for dinner?

679
01:13:45,137 --> 01:13:47,098
Hey, punk.

680
01:13:48,140 --> 01:13:52,103
Let me ask you,
how long had you been standing here?

681
01:13:52,269 --> 01:13:55,314
How many things have you learn here?

682
01:13:55,481 --> 01:13:58,192
I stood there for a long time, but...

683
01:13:59,652 --> 01:14:00,861
didn't learn anything.

684
01:14:01,904 --> 01:14:03,489
Why didn't you learn?

685
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:09,120
Don't you know I'm a descendant
of the Five Tigers of the North?

686
01:14:10,663 --> 01:14:13,624
That means
someone with some special skills.

687
01:14:16,293 --> 01:14:18,796
There is a bit of skill, but it's useless.

688
01:14:21,173 --> 01:14:23,259
Coach, let me take care of that punk.

689
01:14:23,426 --> 01:14:26,721
Coach, we've been learning so long,
it's a chance for us to try it out.

690
01:14:26,887 --> 01:14:27,847
Sure!

691
01:14:28,014 --> 01:14:29,390
That's right!

692
01:14:29,557 --> 01:14:33,519
I just came down from the mountain
and want to find someone to spar with.

693
01:14:34,478 --> 01:14:37,148
I hadn't expected such a good place!

694
01:14:37,314 --> 01:14:40,151
You want a fight? Beat him!

695
01:14:51,829 --> 01:14:52,788
Out of the way!

696
01:14:55,207 --> 01:14:58,002
Hey, which school or clan are you from?

697
01:14:58,169 --> 01:15:01,380
Tongbei Fist. 'White ape
pulls curtains through the mountain gate.'

698
01:15:01,547 --> 01:15:02,506
Hold on!

699
01:15:03,841 --> 01:15:05,801
Right. Don't shame yourself.

700
01:15:06,719 --> 01:15:08,429
One on one.

701
01:15:08,596 --> 01:15:09,555
Get 'im.

702
01:15:18,731 --> 01:15:19,690
Don't move.

703
01:15:23,861 --> 01:15:24,653
Whose turn is it?

704
01:15:27,490 --> 01:15:28,449
Wai.

705
01:15:40,961 --> 01:15:41,921
Let me!

706
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:07,822
Hey!

707
01:16:07,988 --> 01:16:10,574
Don't worry, you didn't split into two.

708
01:16:23,546 --> 01:16:25,506
- What?
- What?

709
01:16:26,048 --> 01:16:29,677
Several teaching assistants
have been knocked out, it's your turn!

710
01:16:29,844 --> 01:16:30,636
I —

711
01:16:39,478 --> 01:16:42,231
Hey...! If someone has a weapon,
you should as well!

712
01:16:42,815 --> 01:16:45,609
No need! Here, I'll give it to you.

713
01:16:45,776 --> 01:16:46,735
Thanks.

714
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:08,883
I poke. I push.

715
01:17:14,555 --> 01:17:15,514
'Mad chicken's kick.'

716
01:17:17,224 --> 01:17:20,144
- Hey, keep on!
- Surely not, me again?

717
01:17:20,311 --> 01:17:21,896
If not you, who'll go?

718
01:17:31,488 --> 01:17:33,449
Jump...!

719
01:17:34,992 --> 01:17:36,785
Broom kick! Right into your tummy.

720
01:17:41,498 --> 01:17:43,709
Go on. Go on!

721
01:17:51,842 --> 01:17:52,801
Hey"

722
01:17:53,510 --> 01:17:55,221
- Hey! Come back!
- Leave me alone!

723
01:18:00,517 --> 01:18:01,936
Hey, it's your turn this time.

724
01:18:02,519 --> 01:18:03,479
Of course!

725
01:18:04,063 --> 01:18:08,525
Damn imp. Give you a taste of
my Five-Poison Spider Hand!

726
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,119
'Tongbei water and fire'!

727
01:18:29,129 --> 01:18:31,215
Aren't spiders good at spinning silk?

728
01:18:36,053 --> 01:18:37,012
'Spider spirit'!

729
01:18:37,179 --> 01:18:38,806
Sting...!

730
01:18:47,481 --> 01:18:49,608
My 'smart ape kicks mountain gate' trick...

731
01:18:49,775 --> 01:18:51,235
is strong, right?

732
01:18:52,945 --> 01:18:56,073
You watch out! 'Spider catches an insect'!

733
01:19:36,363 --> 01:19:37,323
Go to hell!

734
01:19:38,741 --> 01:19:39,950
You got me!

735
01:19:53,672 --> 01:19:54,840
'Tongbei continuous punch'.

736
01:20:08,145 --> 01:20:09,229
I've also found a girl.

737
01:20:09,396 --> 01:20:10,356
Not bad.

738
01:20:11,190 --> 01:20:13,776
Master, this smart arse is here
to challenge the school.

739
01:20:14,360 --> 01:20:15,319
Step aside.

740
01:20:33,128 --> 01:20:34,421
Your Chicken Foot isn't bad!

741
01:20:39,885 --> 01:20:41,345
You handle the challenger!

742
01:20:56,402 --> 01:20:57,361
Nice!

743
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:22,511
- Sorry! Sorry for the trouble!
- Hey, I haven't finished!

744
01:21:22,678 --> 01:21:25,514
- Let's go, it's their place.
- I need to beat her up.

745
01:21:29,685 --> 01:21:31,145
CHOU'S RESTAURANT

746
01:21:57,212 --> 01:21:58,505
Here, cheers.

747
01:22:02,009 --> 01:22:03,719
Why did you do that?

748
01:22:03,886 --> 01:22:06,472
Leaving early to make trouble
at a martial arts school?

749
01:22:06,638 --> 01:22:09,933
I wasn't. They asked me to fight.

750
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:13,312
I don't believe they'd ask you
into the martial arts school to fight.

751
01:22:16,148 --> 01:22:19,109
But it's true that I want
to find someone to compete with.

752
01:22:21,111 --> 01:22:22,571
- Why?
- To be honest,

753
01:22:22,738 --> 01:22:26,241
our Tongbei Fist is just deadly kung fu
from books and school.

754
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,994
How can I know if I don't fight with them?

755
01:22:29,161 --> 01:22:32,623
If you want to fight,
you'll have chances, kiddo.

756
01:22:33,999 --> 01:22:36,710
You mean Tung Hak-Fung
of the Black Tiger gang?

757
01:22:38,504 --> 01:22:39,755
You think they'll let us go?

758
01:22:40,422 --> 01:22:41,673
True.

759
01:22:41,840 --> 01:22:44,927
They can't find us,
so they must think we're practising hard.

760
01:22:45,093 --> 01:22:46,261
Of course.

761
01:22:46,428 --> 01:22:49,932
To eliminate the Tongbei school,
they'll pursue us all the way.

762
01:22:55,437 --> 01:22:59,399
But, Jau,
I really don't want to die at their hands.

763
01:23:01,068 --> 01:23:04,321
You're riding a tiger you can't get off.
Think you can walk away?

764
01:23:04,905 --> 01:23:07,032
That's not what I said.
As the saying goes,

765
01:23:07,199 --> 01:23:10,285
'Each has its own brilliant moves;
each teacher has their own method.'

766
01:23:10,452 --> 01:23:13,956
- I don't get what you mean.
- You don't have to get it. Here.

767
01:23:14,540 --> 01:23:16,250
Have a good drink today.

768
01:23:18,293 --> 01:23:20,379
Jau, let's not go home till we're drunk.

769
01:23:40,357 --> 01:23:41,316
Jau!

770
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:44,570
Jau...!

771
01:24:54,514 --> 01:24:55,724
Long time no see.

772
01:24:56,933 --> 01:24:57,893
That's right.

773
01:24:59,978 --> 01:25:01,188
I've always missed you!

774
01:25:01,355 --> 01:25:03,857
You escaped before,

775
01:25:04,024 --> 01:25:06,109
but it won't be so easy this time.

776
01:25:06,276 --> 01:25:09,112
Today? You wanna get me?
It's going to be really tough today.

777
01:25:37,974 --> 01:25:41,478
- Hey, this punk's different from before!
- Different? There's more to come!

778
01:26:56,636 --> 01:26:57,596
Wai Chung!

779
01:26:59,765 --> 01:27:00,974
'Tongbei chops the Bagua'.

780
01:27:12,277 --> 01:27:13,612
'Tongbei continuous punch'.

781
01:27:33,799 --> 01:27:35,258
'Tongbei water and fire'!

782
01:28:01,368 --> 01:28:03,578
- Drunken ape?
- You know it!

783
01:28:55,964 --> 01:28:57,173
That's the drunken ape?

784
01:28:58,675 --> 01:29:01,011
A bit drunk, but it's not finished yet.

785
01:29:01,595 --> 01:29:03,138
I'll finish you off today!

786
01:29:35,962 --> 01:29:37,964
Hang in there! No need to shake your head!

787
01:30:35,021 --> 01:30:37,816
- Hey, don't be scared...
- Only you're scared, kiddo!

788
01:30:45,365 --> 01:30:46,491
'Tongbei chops the Bagua'.

789
01:30:53,123 --> 01:30:55,250
Chops the Bagua...!

790
01:30:55,417 --> 01:30:57,877
'Chops the Bagua', your arse!

791
01:31:01,297 --> 01:31:03,383
Tongbei...!

792
01:31:07,137 --> 01:31:08,596
I'LL make your feet soft!

793
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,473
Die...

794
01:31:13,351 --> 01:31:15,437
- I'm all numb!
- See if you can fight more!

795
01:31:16,021 --> 01:31:18,231
There's another move! Deadly clingy fight.

796
01:31:20,442 --> 01:31:21,401
Deadly clingy fight?

797
01:31:40,420 --> 01:31:41,379
Won't you fight?

798
01:32:18,458 --> 01:32:19,417
You hit me!

799
01:32:38,019 --> 01:32:40,230
Hey, let me ask you, why were you here?

800
01:32:40,396 --> 01:32:42,440
Smart arse,
you really thought I was drunk.

801
01:32:42,607 --> 01:32:44,567
I guessed that you'd leave me behind!

802
01:32:45,610 --> 01:32:48,488
Right, now that the enemy's
been wiped out, let's split up.

803
01:32:48,655 --> 01:32:50,198
Hold it! Bring out the rare book!

804
01:32:50,365 --> 01:32:51,324
Rare book?
