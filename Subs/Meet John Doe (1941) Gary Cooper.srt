1
00:02:22,667 --> 00:02:23,960
Yeah, D.B.?

2
00:02:24,043 --> 00:02:25,587
Oh, just cleaning out the dead wood.

3
00:02:25,837 --> 00:02:26,964
Okay.

4
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,968
Look, Mr. Connell,
I just can't afford to be

5
00:02:30,051 --> 00:02:31,844
without work right now,
not even for a day.

6
00:02:31,928 --> 00:02:33,722
I've got a mother and two kid sisters--

7
00:02:33,807 --> 00:02:35,433
More good luck telegrams.

8
00:02:36,059 --> 00:02:38,144
Well, you know how it is. I...

9
00:02:38,228 --> 00:02:40,107
I've just got to keep on working, see?

10
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,568
Sorry, sister.
I was sent down here to clean house.

11
00:02:42,652 --> 00:02:44,194
I told you I can't use
your column anymore.

12
00:02:44,696 --> 00:02:46,031
It's lavender and no lace.

13
00:02:46,115 --> 00:02:47,658
<i>- Sir?</i>
- Send those other people in.

14
00:02:47,742 --> 00:02:48,910
I'll tell you what I'll do.

15
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:50,537
I get 30 dollars a week.

16
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:52,540
I'll take 25, 20 if necessary.

17
00:02:52,623 --> 00:02:54,001
I'll do anything you say.

18
00:02:54,084 --> 00:02:55,293
It isn't the money.

19
00:02:55,377 --> 00:02:56,379
We're after circulation.

20
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,922
What we need is fireworks.

21
00:02:58,006 --> 00:02:59,842
People that can hit with
sledgehammers, start arguments.

22
00:02:59,925 --> 00:03:00,759
Oh, I can do that.

23
00:03:00,843 --> 00:03:02,011
I know this town inside and out.

24
00:03:02,095 --> 00:03:03,138
Oh, give me a chance, please.

25
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:04,723
All right, come in, come in, come in.

26
00:03:05,725 --> 00:03:06,934
Cashier's got your check.

27
00:03:07,351 --> 00:03:08,227
Who are these people?

28
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:10,897
Gibbs, Foley, Cunningham, Giles.

29
00:03:12,149 --> 00:03:13,067
Hey you, sister!

30
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:15,863
Don't forget to get out your last column
before you pick up your check.

31
00:03:34,679 --> 00:03:36,850
You're a couple of sticks
shy on your column, Ann.

32
00:03:36,932 --> 00:03:38,602
Big rich slob like
D.B. Norton buys a paper

33
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:40,854
and 40 heads are chopped off.

34
00:03:40,938 --> 00:03:42,691
- Did you get it too?
- Yeah.

35
00:03:43,025 --> 00:03:43,775
You too?

36
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,071
Aw, Joe.

37
00:03:46,154 --> 00:03:48,282
Oh, I'm sorry darling.

38
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:50,494
Why don't we tear the building down?

39
00:03:50,576 --> 00:03:53,247
Before you do, Ann,
perhaps you better finish this column.

40
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:55,541
Yeah, lavender and no lace.

41
00:03:57,251 --> 00:03:58,211
Wait, Joe.

42
00:03:58,295 --> 00:03:59,130
Wait.

43
00:04:03,051 --> 00:04:04,679
Wants fireworks, huh?

44
00:04:05,721 --> 00:04:06,473
Okay.

45
00:04:24,413 --> 00:04:25,249
Here.

46
00:04:26,750 --> 00:04:29,378
"Below is a letter
which reached my desk this morning.

47
00:04:29,462 --> 00:04:31,173
It's a commentary
on what we laughingly call

48
00:04:31,257 --> 00:04:32,591
a civilized world.

49
00:04:32,675 --> 00:04:34,010
'Dear Miss Mitchell,

50
00:04:34,094 --> 00:04:36,556
four years ago I was fired out of my job.

51
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,642
Since then, I haven't
been able to get another one.

52
00:04:38,976 --> 00:04:41,228
At first, I was sore
at the State Administration

53
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:43,773
because it's on account
of the slimy politics here

54
00:04:43,857 --> 00:04:45,733
we have all this unemployment,

55
00:04:46,569 --> 00:04:49,197
but in looking around,
it seems the whole world's going to pot.

56
00:04:49,531 --> 00:04:51,242
So, in protest,
I'm going to commit suicide

57
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:53,579
by jumping off the City Hall roof.

58
00:04:53,661 --> 00:04:56,708
Signed, a disgusted
American citizen, John Doe.'

59
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,962
Editor's note, if you ask this column,

60
00:05:00,045 --> 00:05:02,465
the wrong people
are jumping off the roofs."

61
00:05:03,049 --> 00:05:06,052
Hey, Ann, this is
the old fake-a-roo, isn't it?

62
00:05:06,137 --> 00:05:08,098
Never mind that, Joe, go ahead.

63
00:05:30,337 --> 00:05:32,464
"'And it's because of the slimy politics

64
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:34,716
that we have all this unemployment here.

65
00:05:34,966 --> 00:05:35,928
There it is.

66
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:38,013
That's D.B. Norton's
opening attack on the Governor.

67
00:05:38,096 --> 00:05:40,391
Why Jim, it's just
a letter sent into a column.

68
00:05:40,475 --> 00:05:41,810
No, no, I can smell it.

69
00:05:41,894 --> 00:05:42,728
That's Norton.

70
00:05:42,811 --> 00:05:43,771
Good morning, gentlemen.

71
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:44,605
Good morning, Governor.

72
00:05:44,689 --> 00:05:45,815
You're here rather early.

73
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:48,110
Governor, did you happen to see this
in The New <i>Bulletin?</i>

74
00:05:48,194 --> 00:05:52,157
Mm, yes, I had it served with
my breakfast this morning.

75
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,993
Jim thinks it's D.B. Norton at work.

76
00:05:54,077 --> 00:05:54,953
Of course it is.

77
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:57,664
Oh, come Jim, that little item?

78
00:05:57,748 --> 00:05:59,751
D.B. Norton does things
in a much bigger way.

79
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:01,754
This is his opening
attack on you, Governor.

80
00:06:01,837 --> 00:06:03,047
Take my word for it.

81
00:06:03,464 --> 00:06:05,133
What did he buy a paper for?

82
00:06:05,217 --> 00:06:07,887
Why did he engage a high
pressure editor like Come" for?

83
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,180
He's in the oil business.

84
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:11,267
I tell you, Governor,
he's after your scalp.

85
00:06:11,349 --> 00:06:12,435
All right, Jim, all right.

86
00:06:12,519 --> 00:06:14,771
Don't burst a blood vessel.

87
00:06:14,854 --> 00:06:16,274
I'll look into it.

88
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:17,275
<i>Yes, sir?</i>

89
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:20,320
Get me Spencer of
the <i>Daily Chronicle,</i> please.

90
00:06:20,404 --> 00:06:22,156
Yes, yes, I saw it, Governor.

91
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,076
If you ask me, that's a phony letter.

92
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:26,412
Why, that gag has got whiskers on it.

93
00:06:26,494 --> 00:06:27,247
Hmm?

94
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:30,418
Okay, I'll get the Mayor and maybe
the Chamber of Commerce to go after them.

95
00:06:31,335 --> 00:06:32,713
Get Mayor Loveett on the phone.

96
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:34,463
Sorry, the Mayor's busy
on the other phone.

97
00:06:35,133 --> 00:06:36,509
Yes, I know, Mrs. Brewster.

98
00:06:36,592 --> 00:06:38,554
It's a terrible reflection on our city.

99
00:06:38,637 --> 00:06:40,055
I've had a dozen calls already.

100
00:06:40,138 --> 00:06:41,098
Spencer at the <i>Chronicle.</i>

101
00:06:41,182 --> 00:06:42,517
- Hold him.
- Just a minute.

102
00:06:42,767 --> 00:06:44,520
Yes, Mrs. Brewster, I'm listening.

103
00:06:44,603 --> 00:06:47,149
I insist that this John Doe man be found

104
00:06:47,232 --> 00:06:48,442
and given a job at once.

105
00:06:48,525 --> 00:06:51,445
Now if something isn't done about it,
I'll call out the whole Auxiliary.

106
00:06:51,529 --> 00:06:53,657
<i>Yes, and the Junior Auxiliary too.</i>

107
00:06:53,741 --> 00:06:55,869
<i>We'll hold a meeting and see that it is.</i>

108
00:06:55,952 --> 00:06:56,745
Yes, Spencer?

109
00:06:56,828 --> 00:06:57,996
Who?

110
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:58,914
The governor?

111
00:06:58,998 --> 00:06:59,999
Well, what about me?

112
00:07:00,082 --> 00:07:01,585
It's my building he jumping off of,

113
00:07:01,668 --> 00:07:02,919
and I'm up for re-election too.

114
00:07:03,002 --> 00:07:03,837
- Shh.
- What are you doing?

115
00:07:03,921 --> 00:07:05,131
Get Connell at the <i>Bulletin.</i>

116
00:07:05,214 --> 00:07:07,343
Why, why, he's liable to go
right past my win--

117
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,677
- Get me Connell.
- What was that?

118
00:07:08,761 --> 00:07:09,887
- What?
- out the window.

119
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,096
Something just flew by.

120
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:13,184
- I didn't see anything.
- Well, don't stand there, you idiot.

121
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:14,602
Go and look. Open the window.

122
00:07:15,728 --> 00:07:18,024
Oh, why did he have
to pick on my building?

123
00:07:18,107 --> 00:07:19,859
- Is there a crowd in the street?
- No, sir.

124
00:07:19,942 --> 00:07:21,778
Then maybe he's caught on a ledge.
Look again.

125
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:25,033
I think it must have been a seagull.

126
00:07:25,116 --> 00:07:25,950
A seagull?

127
00:07:26,034 --> 00:07:27,995
What's a seagull
doing around the City Hall?

128
00:07:28,621 --> 00:07:30,082
That's a bad omen, isn't it?

129
00:07:30,165 --> 00:07:32,126
Oh no sir, the seagull is a lovely bird.

130
00:07:32,835 --> 00:07:34,003
It's all right, Mrs. Brewster.

131
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:35,004
It was just a seagull.

132
00:07:35,089 --> 00:07:36,673
- Connell?
- Nothing's happened yet.

133
00:07:36,757 --> 00:07:37,548
I'm watching.

134
00:07:37,633 --> 00:07:38,760
Don't worry, Mrs. Brewster.

135
00:07:38,842 --> 00:07:40,303
Just leave it all to me.

136
00:07:40,386 --> 00:07:41,680
Spencer, I'll call you back.

137
00:07:42,598 --> 00:07:44,184
Hello, Connell?

138
00:07:44,559 --> 00:07:45,977
This is--what are you doing?

139
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,062
This is the Mayor.

140
00:07:47,146 --> 00:07:48,147
Yes, Mayor Lovett.

141
00:07:48,230 --> 00:07:49,566
How many times you gonna call me?

142
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,192
I've got everybody
and his brother and sister

143
00:07:51,276 --> 00:07:52,694
out looking for him.

144
00:07:53,112 --> 00:07:54,530
Did you see the box I'm running?

145
00:07:56,699 --> 00:07:58,036
"An appeal to John Doe.

146
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,246
Think it over, John.

147
00:07:59,329 --> 00:08:01,331
'Life can be beautiful, ' says Mayor.

148
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,668
If you need a job,
apply to the editor of this paper,"

149
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:05,169
and so forth and so forth.

150
00:08:05,754 --> 00:08:08,049
Okay, Mayor, I'll let you know
as soon as I have something.

151
00:08:08,591 --> 00:08:09,593
What?

152
00:08:10,051 --> 00:08:11,763
Well, pull down the blinds.

153
00:08:12,263 --> 00:08:13,431
Went up to Miss Mitchell's house, boss.

154
00:08:13,515 --> 00:08:14,933
Boy, she's in a bad way.

155
00:08:15,017 --> 00:08:16,351
- Where is she?
- Hey, do you know something?

156
00:08:16,436 --> 00:08:17,604
She supports her mother and two kids.

157
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:18,688
What do you know about that?

158
00:08:18,772 --> 00:08:20,023
- Did you find her?
- No.

159
00:08:20,106 --> 00:08:21,108
Her mother's awful worried about her.

160
00:08:21,192 --> 00:08:23,404
When she left the house, she said
she was going on a roaring drunk.

161
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:24,447
The girl, I mean.

162
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:25,948
- Go out and find her.
- Sure.

163
00:08:26,867 --> 00:08:28,325
Hey, but the biggest thing
I didn't tell ya.

164
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:30,620
Her old man's Doc Mitchell, you know,
the doc who saved my mother's life

165
00:08:30,705 --> 00:08:32,916
and wouldn't take any money for it.
You remember that.

166
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,627
Okay, boss, I'll go and look for her.

167
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:39,800
Holy smokes, Commissioner.

168
00:08:39,884 --> 00:08:41,261
You've had 24 hours.

169
00:08:41,636 --> 00:08:44,056
Okay, Hawkshaw, grab a pencil.

170
00:08:44,140 --> 00:08:45,558
Here it is again.

171
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:51,692
About five-foot-five,
brown eyes, light chestnut hair,

172
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:53,861
and as fine a pair of legs as--

173
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:56,907
Ever walked into this office.

174
00:08:59,952 --> 00:09:01,288
- Did you want to see me?
- No.

175
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:04,042
I've had the whole Army
and Navy out searching for you

176
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,668
because that's a game
we play here every day.

177
00:09:05,752 --> 00:09:07,463
I remember distinctly being fired.

178
00:09:07,546 --> 00:09:09,633
That's right,
but you have a piece of property

179
00:09:09,716 --> 00:09:10,967
that still belongs to this newspaper,

180
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:11,886
and I'd like to have it.

181
00:09:11,969 --> 00:09:12,803
- What's that?
- The letter.

182
00:09:12,887 --> 00:09:14,640
- What letter?
- The letter from John Doe.

183
00:09:15,307 --> 00:09:17,310
- Oh.
- The whole town's in an uproar.

184
00:09:17,393 --> 00:09:19,103
We've got to find him,
and the letter's the only clue.

185
00:09:19,479 --> 00:09:20,439
There is no letter.

186
00:09:20,523 --> 00:09:21,941
We'll get a handwriting expert to--

187
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,110
What?

188
00:09:24,486 --> 00:09:25,320
There is no letter.

189
00:09:29,243 --> 00:09:30,077
Say that again.

190
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,579
There's no letter. I made it up.

191
00:09:32,372 --> 00:09:33,373
You made it up.

192
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:35,918
Mm-hmm.
You said you wanted fireworks.

193
00:09:36,001 --> 00:09:38,880
Don't you know there are
nine jobs waiting for this guy,

194
00:09:38,964 --> 00:09:40,925
22 families want to board him free,

195
00:09:41,008 --> 00:09:42,468
five women want to marry him,

196
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:45,180
and the Mayor's practically
ready to adopt him, and you--

197
00:09:45,264 --> 00:09:46,224
Just called the morgue, boss.

198
00:09:46,307 --> 00:09:47,684
- They say there's a girl there--
- Shut up!

199
00:09:48,978 --> 00:09:50,604
- Ann! Say, why didn't you--
- Beany!

200
00:09:50,688 --> 00:09:52,399
Only one thing to do, Hank.

201
00:09:52,482 --> 00:09:54,110
Drop the whole business quickly.

202
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,404
- How?
- Run a story, say John Doe was in here,

203
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,448
and is sorry he wrote the letter and--

204
00:09:58,532 --> 00:09:59,867
That's right. You've got it, sure.

205
00:09:59,951 --> 00:10:01,786
He came in here and
I made him change his mind.

206
00:10:01,869 --> 00:10:03,581
"Bulletin Editor Saves John Doe's Life."

207
00:10:03,664 --> 00:10:04,540
Why, it's perfect.

208
00:10:04,623 --> 00:10:05,792
I'll have Ned write it up.

209
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:07,919
Oh, Ned, I got a story I want you--

210
00:10:08,003 --> 00:10:09,255
Wait a minute.

211
00:10:09,338 --> 00:10:12,301
Listen, you great big, wonderful genius
of a newspaperman.

212
00:10:12,384 --> 00:10:14,846
You came down here to shoot some life
into this dying paper, didn't you?

213
00:10:14,929 --> 00:10:17,474
Well, the whole town's
curious about John Doe and boom!

214
00:10:17,558 --> 00:10:18,892
Just like that, you're going to bury him.

215
00:10:18,976 --> 00:10:20,312
There's enough circulation in that man

216
00:10:20,395 --> 00:10:22,314
to start a shortage in the ink market.

217
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:23,983
- In what man?
- John Doe.

218
00:10:24,066 --> 00:10:24,942
What John Doe?

219
00:10:25,026 --> 00:10:26,945
Our John Doe, the one I made up.

220
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:28,990
Look, genius, now look.

221
00:10:29,365 --> 00:10:30,992
Suppose there was a John Doe,

222
00:10:31,076 --> 00:10:32,995
and he walked into this office,
what would you do?

223
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:34,789
Find him a job and
forget about the whole business,

224
00:10:34,873 --> 00:10:35,790
I suppose, huh?

225
00:10:35,874 --> 00:10:38,252
Not me, I'd make a deal with him.

226
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:39,963
- A deal?
- Sure, when you get ahold of a stunt

227
00:10:40,047 --> 00:10:42,425
that sells papers,
you don't drop it like a hot potato.

228
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:43,843
Why, this is good for
at least a couple of months.

229
00:10:43,926 --> 00:10:44,719
You know what I'd do?

230
00:10:44,802 --> 00:10:47,181
Between now and let's say Christmas,
when he's gonna jump,

231
00:10:47,264 --> 00:10:48,308
I'd run a daily yarn.

232
00:10:48,391 --> 00:10:51,103
Starting with his boyhood,
his schooling, his first job.

233
00:10:51,437 --> 00:10:53,689
A wide-eyed youngster
facing a chaotic world.

234
00:10:53,940 --> 00:10:54,983
The problem of the average man,

235
00:10:55,067 --> 00:10:56,778
of all the John Does in the world.

236
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:58,488
Now, then comes the drama.

237
00:10:58,571 --> 00:10:59,782
He meets discouragement.

238
00:10:59,865 --> 00:11:02,201
He finds the world has feet of clay,
his ideals crumble.

239
00:11:02,284 --> 00:11:03,203
So, what does he do?

240
00:11:03,286 --> 00:11:06,582
He decides to commit suicide in protest
against the state of civilization.

241
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,335
He thinks of the river, but no.

242
00:11:08,418 --> 00:11:10,420
No, he has a better idea, the City Hall.

243
00:11:10,504 --> 00:11:12,632
Why?
Because he wants to attract attention.

244
00:11:12,715 --> 00:11:14,301
He wants to get a few things off his chest

245
00:11:14,385 --> 00:11:16,303
and that's the only way
he can get himself heard.

246
00:11:16,387 --> 00:11:17,514
- So?
- So?

247
00:11:17,597 --> 00:11:19,558
So, he writes me a letter
and I dig him up.

248
00:11:19,642 --> 00:11:21,435
He pours out his soul to me.

249
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:24,648
And from now on we quote,
"I Protest," by John Doe.

250
00:11:24,731 --> 00:11:26,859
He protests against
all the evils in the world,

251
00:11:26,943 --> 00:11:28,862
the greed, the lust, the hate, the fear,

252
00:11:28,946 --> 00:11:30,698
all of man's inhumanity to man.

253
00:11:30,782 --> 00:11:32,117
Arguments will start.

254
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,994
Should he commit suicide or should he not?

255
00:11:34,078 --> 00:11:36,288
People will write in,
pleading with him, but no.

256
00:11:36,623 --> 00:11:38,750
No, sir, John Doe will remain adamant.

257
00:11:38,834 --> 00:11:42,506
On Christmas Eve,
hot or cold, he goes, see?

258
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:47,512
Very pretty, very pretty indeed,
Miss Mitchell,

259
00:11:47,762 --> 00:11:50,474
but would you mind telling me
who goes on Christmas Eve?

260
00:11:50,558 --> 00:11:51,852
- John Doe.
- What John Doe?!

261
00:11:51,935 --> 00:11:54,021
The one we hire for the job, you lunkhead!

262
00:11:54,105 --> 00:11:55,314
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

263
00:11:55,398 --> 00:11:57,443
Let me get this
through this lame brain of mine.

264
00:11:57,693 --> 00:11:59,529
Are you suggesting we go out
and hire someone

265
00:11:59,612 --> 00:12:01,114
to say he's gonna commit suicide
on Christmas Eve?

266
00:12:01,197 --> 00:12:02,783
- Is that it?
- Why, you're catching on.

267
00:12:02,867 --> 00:12:04,660
- Who for instance?
- Anybody.

268
00:12:04,744 --> 00:12:06,872
- Beany'll do.
- Why, su--

269
00:12:07,414 --> 00:12:08,374
Who, me?

270
00:12:08,458 --> 00:12:10,376
Jump off a--
Oh no, anytime but Christmas.

271
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:11,503
I'm superstitious.

272
00:12:17,052 --> 00:12:18,387
Miss Mitchell, do me a favor, will ya?

273
00:12:18,471 --> 00:12:20,515
Go on out and get married,
and have a lot of babies,

274
00:12:20,599 --> 00:12:22,643
but stay out of the newspaper business.

275
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:24,772
Better get that story in, Hank.
It's getting late.

276
00:12:24,855 --> 00:12:26,273
You're supposed to be a smart guy.

277
00:12:26,356 --> 00:12:27,859
If it was raining 100 dollar bills,

278
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:30,153
you'd be out looking for a dime
you lost someplace.

279
00:12:30,613 --> 00:12:33,199
Holy smokes, wasting my time
listening to this mad woman.

280
00:12:33,283 --> 00:12:35,327
Look, chief, look what
the <i>Chronicle's</i> running on John Doe.

281
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:36,287
They say it's a fake.

282
00:12:36,704 --> 00:12:38,289
Why, the no-good, the...

283
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,502
"John Doe story, amateur journalism.

284
00:12:41,961 --> 00:12:44,924
It's palpably phony, it's a wonder
anyone's taking it seriously.

285
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,803
- What do you think of those guys?
- That's fine, that's fine.

286
00:12:47,886 --> 00:12:50,138
Now fall right into their laps, go ahead.

287
00:12:50,222 --> 00:12:52,225
Say John Doe walked in
and called the whole thing off.

288
00:12:52,308 --> 00:12:54,561
You know what that's gonna
sound like on top of this.

289
00:12:54,895 --> 00:12:55,813
- That's all, Ned.
- Thank you.

290
00:12:55,896 --> 00:12:56,898
All right.

291
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,528
Amateur journalism, huh?

292
00:13:00,611 --> 00:13:02,113
Why, the bunch of sophomores.

293
00:13:02,197 --> 00:13:03,740
I could teach them more about--

294
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:05,743
Hey, boss!
Get a load of this.

295
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,078
- What?
- Look.

296
00:13:11,334 --> 00:13:12,085
What do they want?

297
00:13:12,168 --> 00:13:13,754
They all say
they wrote the John Doe letter.

298
00:13:13,838 --> 00:13:15,172
Yeah, I wrote it, boss.

299
00:13:15,631 --> 00:13:17,759
- Oh, they all wrote the letter.
- Tell them all to wait.

300
00:13:17,843 --> 00:13:20,680
Look, Mr. Connell,
one of those men is your John Doe.

301
00:13:20,763 --> 00:13:22,599
They're desperate and will
do anything for a cup of coffee.

302
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:25,562
Pick one out and you can make
the <i>Chronicle</i> eat their words.

303
00:13:26,062 --> 00:13:27,523
I'm beginning to like this.

304
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,694
If you ask me, Hank,
you're playing around with dynamite.

305
00:13:30,777 --> 00:13:32,112
No, no, no, no, no, the girl's right.

306
00:13:32,195 --> 00:13:33,906
We can't let
the <i>Chronicle</i> get the laugh on us.

307
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:35,783
We've got to produce a John Doe now.

308
00:13:35,868 --> 00:13:37,411
Amateur journalism, huh?

309
00:13:37,494 --> 00:13:38,913
I'll show those guys.

310
00:13:38,997 --> 00:13:40,373
Sure, and there's no reason
for them to find out

311
00:13:40,456 --> 00:13:44,379
the truth either, because
naturally [won't say anything.

312
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:47,508
Okay, sister, you get your job back.

313
00:13:47,592 --> 00:13:48,509
Plus a bonus.

314
00:13:48,926 --> 00:13:49,677
What bonus?

315
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,555
Oh, the bonus of 1,000 dollars
the <i>Chronicle</i>

316
00:13:51,638 --> 00:13:53,474
was going to pay me
for this little document.

317
00:13:53,558 --> 00:13:55,560
You'll find it says that,
"I, Ann Mitchell, hereby certify

318
00:13:55,643 --> 00:13:57,813
that the John Doe
letter was created by me--"

319
00:13:57,897 --> 00:13:59,774
- I can read, I can read.
- Sorry.

320
00:14:02,028 --> 00:14:03,654
You think this is worth 1,000 dollars,
do ya?

321
00:14:03,738 --> 00:14:06,241
Oh, the <i>Chronicle</i>
would consider it dirt cheap.

322
00:14:06,867 --> 00:14:08,620
Packs everything including a gun.

323
00:14:09,287 --> 00:14:11,040
Okay, sister, you got yourself a deal.

324
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:12,416
Now let's take a look at the candidates.

325
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:15,128
The one we pick has got
to be the typical, average man.

326
00:14:15,545 --> 00:14:17,340
Typical American
that can keep his mouth shut.

327
00:14:17,423 --> 00:14:20,719
Show me an American who can
keep his mouth shut and I'll eat him.

328
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:24,308
Okay, Beany, bring 'em in one at a time.

329
00:15:28,644 --> 00:15:30,063
Did you write
that letter to Miss Mitchell?

330
00:15:31,189 --> 00:15:32,400
No, I didn't.

331
00:15:32,483 --> 00:15:33,651
What are you doing up here then?

332
00:15:34,485 --> 00:15:36,447
Well, the paper says there
was some jobs around loose.

333
00:15:36,530 --> 00:15:38,199
Thought there might be one left over.

334
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,743
Had any schooling?

335
00:15:40,326 --> 00:15:42,038
Yeah, a little.

336
00:15:42,121 --> 00:15:43,456
What do you do when you work?

337
00:15:44,124 --> 00:15:45,751
- I used to pitch.
- Baseball?

338
00:15:46,627 --> 00:15:49,047
Yeah, 'til my wing went bad.

339
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,007
Where'd you play?

340
00:15:51,258 --> 00:15:52,677
Bush leagues, mostly.

341
00:15:52,927 --> 00:15:54,804
How about family?
Got any family?

342
00:15:54,888 --> 00:15:55,765
No.

343
00:15:55,848 --> 00:15:57,391
Oh, just traveling through, huh?

344
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:59,435
Yeah, me and a friend of mine.

345
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:00,604
He's outside.

346
00:16:04,985 --> 00:16:05,735
Looks all right.

347
00:16:05,819 --> 00:16:07,322
He's perfect, a baseball player.

348
00:16:07,405 --> 00:16:09,115
What could be more American?

349
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,367
Wish he had a family though.

350
00:16:10,451 --> 00:16:12,411
Be less complicated without a family.

351
00:16:12,496 --> 00:16:13,914
Look at that face, it's wonderful.

352
00:16:14,164 --> 00:16:16,375
They'll believe him. Come on.

353
00:16:18,336 --> 00:16:19,588
What's your name?

354
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:21,132
Willoughby, John Willoughby.

355
00:16:21,216 --> 00:16:23,301
Long John Willoughby,
they called me in baseball.

356
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:26,389
Um, would you, uh, would you like
to make some money?

357
00:16:28,517 --> 00:16:30,561
Yeah, maybe.

358
00:16:31,187 --> 00:16:35,026
Would you be willing to say you
wrote that letter and stick by it?

359
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,118
Mm, I get the idea.

360
00:16:42,285 --> 00:16:44,455
Yeah, maybe.

361
00:16:48,877 --> 00:16:49,671
That's our man.

362
00:16:49,754 --> 00:16:50,713
He's made to order.

363
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:51,548
I don't know.

364
00:16:51,631 --> 00:16:53,175
He don't seem like
the kind of a guy that'd fall in line.

365
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:55,345
When you're desperate for money,
you do a lot of things, Mr. Connell.

366
00:16:55,428 --> 00:16:57,055
He's our man, I tell you.

367
00:16:57,682 --> 00:16:58,766
He's fainted!

368
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:00,434
Get some water, quickly!

369
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,728
Hurry up, Pop.

370
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:03,940
Right here, sit down.

371
00:17:04,023 --> 00:17:04,774
You all right?

372
00:17:04,858 --> 00:17:06,193
Yeah, I'm all right.

373
00:17:07,444 --> 00:17:08,988
How many is that, six?

374
00:17:19,169 --> 00:17:20,504
Pretty hungry, weren't you?

375
00:17:22,423 --> 00:17:25,343
All this John Doe
business is batty, if you ask me.

376
00:17:25,427 --> 00:17:27,013
Well, nobody asked you.

377
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:29,975
Trying to improve
the world by jumping off buildings.

378
00:17:30,058 --> 00:17:32,729
You couldn't improve the world
if the buildings jumped on you.

379
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,107
Don't mind the Colonel.
He hates people.

380
00:17:35,191 --> 00:17:36,942
He likes you enough to stick around.

381
00:17:37,401 --> 00:17:39,279
Well, that's 'cause
we both play doohickeys.

382
00:17:41,199 --> 00:17:43,202
I met him in a boxcar
a couple of years ago.

383
00:17:43,285 --> 00:17:46,789
I was fooling around with my harmonica
and he comes over and joins in.

384
00:17:46,873 --> 00:17:48,834
I haven't been able to shake him since.

385
00:18:10,321 --> 00:18:11,280
All right boys, here he is.

386
00:18:11,364 --> 00:18:13,283
No, no, no, you can't
take pictures of him like that,

387
00:18:13,367 --> 00:18:15,161
eating a sandwich and with a beard.

388
00:18:15,245 --> 00:18:17,706
- But he's gonna jump off a building.
- Yes, but not because he's out of a job.

389
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:18,540
That's not news.

390
00:18:18,624 --> 00:18:20,627
This man's going to jump
as a matter of principle.

391
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,461
Maybe you're right.

392
00:18:21,544 --> 00:18:23,839
We'll clean him up and put him
in a hotel room under bodyguards.

393
00:18:23,923 --> 00:18:24,966
We'll make a mystery out of him.

394
00:18:25,049 --> 00:18:25,926
Did you speak to Mr. Norton?

395
00:18:26,009 --> 00:18:26,760
Thinks it's terrific.

396
00:18:26,843 --> 00:18:27,719
Says for us to go the limit.

397
00:18:27,803 --> 00:18:30,181
Wants us to build a bonfire
under every bigshot in the state.

398
00:18:30,265 --> 00:18:32,685
- Oh, swell. Is that the contract?
- Yeah.

399
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:33,978
What's he doing here?

400
00:18:34,061 --> 00:18:36,064
Friend of his. They play duets together.

401
00:18:36,147 --> 00:18:37,858
Duets? But can we trust him?

402
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,402
- Oh.
- I trust him.

403
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,363
Oh, you trust him, eh?
Well, that's fine.

404
00:18:41,446 --> 00:18:42,406
I suppose he trusts you too.

405
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:44,325
Oh, stop worrying. He's all right.

406
00:18:44,409 --> 00:18:45,493
Okay, but we don't want more than

407
00:18:45,576 --> 00:18:47,788
a couple of hundred
people in on this thing.

408
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:49,874
Now the first thing
I want is an exact copy

409
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:51,669
of the John Doe letter
in your own handwriting.

410
00:18:51,752 --> 00:18:53,212
I've got it already, here.

411
00:18:53,629 --> 00:18:54,798
That's fine.

412
00:18:55,257 --> 00:18:57,427
Now I want you to sign this agreement.

413
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,139
It gives us
an exclusive story under your name,

414
00:19:00,222 --> 00:19:02,641
day by day, from now until Christmas.

415
00:19:03,184 --> 00:19:07,231
On December 26th,
you get one railroad ticket out of town,

416
00:19:07,857 --> 00:19:09,651
and the <i>Bulletin</i> agrees
to pay to have your arm fixed.

417
00:19:09,735 --> 00:19:10,610
That's what you want, isn't it?

418
00:19:10,694 --> 00:19:12,447
Yeah, but it's got to
be by Bone-setter Brown.

419
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:14,450
Okay, Bone-setter Brown goes.

420
00:19:14,533 --> 00:19:15,576
Here, sign it.

421
00:19:15,659 --> 00:19:18,121
Meanwhile,
here's 50 dollars spending money.

422
00:19:18,705 --> 00:19:20,333
That's fine. Beany?

423
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,043
- Yes, boss.
- Take charge of him.

424
00:19:22,126 --> 00:19:24,087
Get him a suite at the Imperial
and hire some bodyguards.

425
00:19:24,171 --> 00:19:25,798
And some new clothes, Beany.

426
00:19:25,882 --> 00:19:27,175
Think we better have him deloused?

427
00:19:27,258 --> 00:19:28,344
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

428
00:19:28,427 --> 00:19:30,012
- Both of them?
- Yes, both of them,

429
00:19:30,095 --> 00:19:31,473
but don't let 'em out of your sight.

430
00:19:31,556 --> 00:19:33,767
- Hey, Beany, gray suit, huh?
- Yeah.

431
00:19:33,850 --> 00:19:35,102
Okay, fellas.

432
00:19:41,652 --> 00:19:43,739
Take it easy, John Doe.

433
00:19:46,743 --> 00:19:49,288
And you, start pounding that typewriter.

434
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:50,956
Oh boy, this is terrific.

435
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:52,417
No responsibilities on our part,

436
00:19:52,501 --> 00:19:54,879
just statements from John Doe,
and we can blast our heads off.

437
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,255
Before you pop too many buttons,

438
00:19:56,339 --> 00:19:58,550
don't forget to make
out that check for 1,000.

439
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,387
Yeah.

440
00:20:02,389 --> 00:20:04,392
Okay, fellas, now let me see.

441
00:20:04,475 --> 00:20:06,269
You sit outside the door
and nobody comes in, see?

442
00:20:06,353 --> 00:20:07,396
You two fellas sit in here.

443
00:20:07,771 --> 00:20:09,190
Hey, pretty nifty, huh?

444
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:12,736
You ain't gonna get me to stay here.

445
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,406
- Sure you are.
- No, sir.

446
00:20:14,489 --> 00:20:17,159
That spot under the bridge where we slept
last night is good enough for me.

447
00:20:18,035 --> 00:20:19,955
- Say, what'll I do with this baggage?
- Oh, stick 'em in the bedroom.

448
00:20:20,038 --> 00:20:21,665
Give me mine, I ain't staying.

449
00:20:23,459 --> 00:20:25,002
You know, we were headed
for the Columbia River country

450
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:27,297
before all this John Doe business came up.

451
00:20:27,381 --> 00:20:28,466
You remember that, don't ya?

452
00:20:28,550 --> 00:20:29,801
Sure, I remember.

453
00:20:29,884 --> 00:20:31,429
Say, did your ears pop
coming up in the elevator?

454
00:20:31,512 --> 00:20:32,263
Mine did.

455
00:20:32,346 --> 00:20:34,057
Oh, Long John, I tell ya, it's no good.

456
00:20:34,141 --> 00:20:36,476
You're gonna get used to a lot of stuff
that's gonna wreck you.

457
00:20:36,561 --> 00:20:39,147
Why, that 50 bucks in your pocket
is beginning to show up on you already.

458
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:41,483
And don't pull that on me neither.

459
00:20:41,567 --> 00:20:44,112
Stop worrying, Colonel.
I'm gonna get my arm fixed out of this.

460
00:20:44,195 --> 00:20:46,323
Hey, here's some cigars the boss sent us.

461
00:20:46,407 --> 00:20:47,324
- Have one.
- Hey, cigars!

462
00:20:47,408 --> 00:20:48,827
- Help yourself.
- No.

463
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,218
Say, I'll bet you even the Major Leaguers
don't rate an outfit like this.

464
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:03,722
Here, make yourself comfortable. Paper?

465
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:06,934
I don't read no papers
and I don't listen to radios neither.

466
00:21:07,268 --> 00:21:09,354
I know the world's been
shaved by a drunken barber

467
00:21:09,438 --> 00:21:10,648
and I don't have to read it.

468
00:21:13,736 --> 00:21:15,529
I've seen guys like you go under before.

469
00:21:15,946 --> 00:21:17,782
Guys that never had a worry,

470
00:21:17,866 --> 00:21:19,660
then they got ahold of some dough
and went goofy.

471
00:21:19,744 --> 00:21:20,786
The first thing that happens to a guy--

472
00:21:20,870 --> 00:21:22,998
- Hey, did you get a load of the bedroom?
- No.

473
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:25,710
The first thing
that happens to a guy like that,

474
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27,504
he starts wanting to go into restaurants

475
00:21:27,587 --> 00:21:32,010
and sit down at a table and
eat salad and cupcakes and tea.

476
00:21:32,427 --> 00:21:34,597
Boy, what that kind of food
does to your system.

477
00:21:40,271 --> 00:21:42,525
The next thing the dope wants is a room.

478
00:21:42,608 --> 00:21:46,238
Yes sir, a room with steam heat
and curtains and rugs,

479
00:21:46,321 --> 00:21:47,447
and before you know it,
he's all softened up

480
00:21:47,531 --> 00:21:49,367
and he can't sleep unless he has a bed.

481
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:51,161
Hey, stop worrying, Colonel.

482
00:21:51,245 --> 00:21:52,704
50 bucks ain't gonna ruin me.

483
00:21:52,788 --> 00:21:54,916
I've seen plenty of fellas
start out with 50 bucks

484
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:56,710
and wind up with a bank account.

485
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:58,629
Hey, what's the matter
with a bank account, anyway?

486
00:21:58,712 --> 00:22:00,215
And let me tell you, Long John,

487
00:22:00,298 --> 00:22:02,760
when you become a guy
with a bank account,

488
00:22:03,010 --> 00:22:04,053
they got ya!

489
00:22:04,136 --> 00:22:05,889
Yes sir, they got ya.

490
00:22:07,391 --> 00:22:09,310
- Who's got him?
- The heelots.

491
00:22:09,394 --> 00:22:10,521
- Who?
- Hey

492
00:22:10,938 --> 00:22:13,525
there's the City Hall tower
I'm supposed to jump off of.

493
00:22:13,608 --> 00:22:14,943
It's even higher than this.

494
00:22:15,026 --> 00:22:16,195
Who's got him?

495
00:22:16,612 --> 00:22:17,822
The heelots.

496
00:22:17,905 --> 00:22:20,784
- Woo!
- Hey, wait a minute.

497
00:22:21,451 --> 00:22:22,954
You're not supposed to jump
'til Christmas Eve.

498
00:22:23,037 --> 00:22:24,873
Do you want to get me in a jam?

499
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:27,126
If it's gonna get you in a jam,
I'll do you a favor.

500
00:22:27,209 --> 00:22:28,211
I won't jump.

501
00:22:29,879 --> 00:22:31,882
And when they got ya,
you got no more chance

502
00:22:31,966 --> 00:22:33,468
than a road rabbit.

503
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:35,178
Hey, who'd you say was going to get him?

504
00:22:35,262 --> 00:22:37,890
Say, is this one of those places where
you ring if you want something?

505
00:22:37,974 --> 00:22:39,435
Yeah, just use the phone.

506
00:22:39,518 --> 00:22:41,228
Boy, I've always wanted to do that.

507
00:22:41,312 --> 00:22:43,148
Hey, Doc, look. Look, Doc.

508
00:22:44,316 --> 00:22:45,860
Give me that again, will ya?

509
00:22:45,943 --> 00:22:47,236
Who's gonna get him?

510
00:22:47,321 --> 00:22:48,947
The heelots.

511
00:22:49,323 --> 00:22:50,158
Who are they?

512
00:22:50,825 --> 00:22:52,368
Listen, sucker, you ever been broke?

513
00:22:52,452 --> 00:22:53,829
Sure, mostly often.

514
00:22:53,912 --> 00:22:54,788
All right.

515
00:22:54,872 --> 00:22:57,083
You're walking along,
not a nickel in your jeans,

516
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,961
you're free as the wind,
nobody bothers you.

517
00:22:59,045 --> 00:23:01,422
Hundreds of people pass you by
in every line of business,

518
00:23:01,506 --> 00:23:04,677
shoes, hats, automobiles,
radios, furniture, everything.

519
00:23:04,761 --> 00:23:07,640
They're all nice,
lovable people and they let you alone.

520
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:08,641
Now, is that right?

521
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,811
Then you get ahold of some dough,
and what happens?

522
00:23:13,147 --> 00:23:17,027
All those nice, sweet,
lovable people become heelots,

523
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:18,529
a lot of heels!

524
00:23:19,864 --> 00:23:23,118
They begin creepin' up on you,
trying to sell you something.

525
00:23:23,744 --> 00:23:27,166
They get long claws and
they get a stranglehold on you,

526
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:29,460
and you squirm and you duck and you holler

527
00:23:29,543 --> 00:23:31,421
and you try to push 'em away
but you haven't got a chance.

528
00:23:31,505 --> 00:23:32,547
They got ya.

529
00:23:33,007 --> 00:23:34,926
First thing you know, you own things.

530
00:23:35,009 --> 00:23:36,762
A car, for instance.

531
00:23:36,845 --> 00:23:39,808
Now your whole life
is messed up with a lot more stuff.

532
00:23:39,891 --> 00:23:44,105
You got license fees and
number plates, and gas and oil,

533
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:47,777
and taxes and insurance,
and identification cards

534
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:50,114
and letters and bills
and flat tires and dents

535
00:23:50,197 --> 00:23:52,616
and traffic tickets and
motorcycle cops and courtrooms

536
00:23:52,701 --> 00:23:56,956
and lawyers and fines and
a million and one other things,

537
00:23:57,206 --> 00:23:58,500
and what happens?

538
00:23:59,876 --> 00:24:02,296
You're not the free and
happy guy you used to be.

539
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:05,300
You gotta have money
to pay for all those things.

540
00:24:05,384 --> 00:24:07,721
So you go after
what the other fella's got,

541
00:24:08,304 --> 00:24:09,597
and there you are.

542
00:24:09,681 --> 00:24:11,267
You're a heelot yourself.

543
00:24:19,945 --> 00:24:21,823
You win, Colonel.
Here, take the 50.

544
00:24:23,241 --> 00:24:24,326
Go out and get rid of it.

545
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:26,495
You bet I will, just as fast as I can.

546
00:24:26,579 --> 00:24:28,331
I'm gonna get some
canned goods, a fishing rod,

547
00:24:28,415 --> 00:24:30,585
and the rest I'm gonna give away.

548
00:24:30,668 --> 00:24:31,919
Give away?

549
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:33,672
Hey, get me a pitcher's glove.

550
00:24:33,756 --> 00:24:35,007
I gotta get some practice.

551
00:24:36,134 --> 00:24:37,343
Say, he's giving it away,

552
00:24:37,427 --> 00:24:38,554
I'm gonna get me some of that.

553
00:24:38,637 --> 00:24:40,974
Hey, come back here, you heelot.

554
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:46,982
Will you send up five hamburgers
with all the trimmings,

555
00:24:47,065 --> 00:24:49,569
five chocolate ice cream sodas,

556
00:24:49,652 --> 00:24:51,488
and five pieces of apple pie?

557
00:24:52,364 --> 00:24:54,575
No, apple, with cheese.

558
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,620
Yeah, thanks.

559
00:25:10,222 --> 00:25:11,389
Hello there.

560
00:25:13,476 --> 00:25:14,977
Well, well.

561
00:25:15,771 --> 00:25:17,898
If it isn't the man about town.

562
00:25:17,982 --> 00:25:18,942
All set, Miss Ann.

563
00:25:19,025 --> 00:25:19,859
Hmm?

564
00:25:20,735 --> 00:25:23,197
Oh, yes, let's go.

565
00:25:23,572 --> 00:25:26,368
Um, let's see, we want
some action in these pictures.

566
00:25:26,452 --> 00:25:27,203
Action?

567
00:25:27,286 --> 00:25:28,079
Mm-hmm.

568
00:25:30,249 --> 00:25:31,583
- That's good.
- No, no, no.

569
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:32,919
This man's going to jump off a roof.

570
00:25:33,002 --> 00:25:34,170
- Oh.
- Here, wait a minute.

571
00:25:34,254 --> 00:25:35,548
Let me comb your hair.

572
00:25:35,631 --> 00:25:36,841
Sit down.

573
00:25:41,138 --> 00:25:42,557
There, that's better.

574
00:25:50,359 --> 00:25:52,571
You know, he's got a nice face, hasn't he?

575
00:25:52,654 --> 00:25:53,613
Yeah, he's pretty.

576
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:57,118
Here, sit down.

577
00:25:57,201 --> 00:25:58,287
Quiet, egghead.

578
00:25:59,204 --> 00:26:01,040
All right, now a serious expression.

579
00:26:01,124 --> 00:26:02,959
I can't. I'm feeling too good.

580
00:26:03,042 --> 00:26:04,295
Oh come on now, this is serious.

581
00:26:04,378 --> 00:26:07,048
You're a man disgusted
with all of civilization.

582
00:26:07,132 --> 00:26:08,717
- With all of it?
- Yes, you're sore at the world.

583
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:10,261
Come on now.

584
00:26:10,595 --> 00:26:11,429
Crabby guy, huh?

585
00:26:11,512 --> 00:26:12,598
Yeah.

586
00:26:15,059 --> 00:26:16,144
No, no.

587
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:19,565
No, no.

588
00:26:22,152 --> 00:26:25,489
No, look, you don't
have to smell the world.

589
00:26:27,993 --> 00:26:29,037
With all those guys in the bleachers--

590
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:30,079
Never mind those guys.

591
00:26:30,163 --> 00:26:31,539
All right, stand up.

592
00:26:31,623 --> 00:26:34,168
Now, let's see what
you look like when you protest.

593
00:26:34,543 --> 00:26:35,378
Against what?

594
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:37,548
Against anything, just protest.

595
00:26:38,716 --> 00:26:39,675
You got me.

596
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,095
Oh. Look, I'm the umpire,

597
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,390
and you just cut the heart of the plate
with your fast one

598
00:26:44,474 --> 00:26:45,224
and I called it a ball.

599
00:26:45,308 --> 00:26:46,602
What would you do?

600
00:26:46,685 --> 00:26:48,520
- Oh, you did, huh?
- Yeah.

601
00:26:48,604 --> 00:26:50,982
Why can't you call it right,
you bone-headed, big-eared--

602
00:26:51,066 --> 00:26:52,151
- Grab it, Eddie, grab it!
- ...pot-bellied...

603
00:26:59,744 --> 00:27:01,538
Extra, extra!

604
00:27:14,347 --> 00:27:16,976
Read all about it! Extra!

605
00:27:24,736 --> 00:27:26,114
<i>Read all about it!</i>

606
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:30,035
<i>Read all about it!</i>

607
00:27:45,472 --> 00:27:47,892
I don't care
whose picture they're publishing.

608
00:27:47,976 --> 00:27:51,272
I still say that
this John Doe person is a myth,

609
00:27:51,355 --> 00:27:53,025
and you can quote me on that,

610
00:27:53,108 --> 00:27:56,487
and I'm going to insist
on his being produced for questioning.

611
00:27:56,863 --> 00:27:59,450
You know as well as I do
that this whole thing

612
00:27:59,533 --> 00:28:02,370
is being engineered by a vicious man

613
00:28:02,454 --> 00:28:05,458
with a vicious purpose, Mr. DB. Norton.

614
00:28:28,865 --> 00:28:30,784
Mr. Connell and
Miss Mitchell are at the house, sir.

615
00:28:30,867 --> 00:28:31,619
Oh, they are?

616
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:32,787
All right, come on.

617
00:28:35,248 --> 00:28:37,752
Personally, I think it's just
plain stupidity to drop it now.

618
00:28:37,835 --> 00:28:39,670
You should see his fan mail, thousands.

619
00:28:39,755 --> 00:28:41,590
Why, it's going over like a house afire.

620
00:28:41,673 --> 00:28:43,051
What are you afraid of, Connell?

621
00:28:43,134 --> 00:28:44,511
It's doubled our circulation.

622
00:28:44,594 --> 00:28:46,180
Yeah, but it's got everybody sore.

623
00:28:46,263 --> 00:28:47,306
Ads are being pulled.

624
00:28:47,389 --> 00:28:48,809
The governor's starting a libel suit.

625
00:28:48,892 --> 00:28:50,685
What's more, they all
know John Doe's a phony

626
00:28:50,769 --> 00:28:51,938
and they insist on seeing him.

627
00:28:52,021 --> 00:28:52,980
Well, what about it? Let them see him.

628
00:28:53,064 --> 00:28:54,691
We'll go 'em one better,
they can also hear him.

629
00:28:54,775 --> 00:28:57,153
You own a radio station, Mr. Norton.
Why not put him on the air?

630
00:28:57,237 --> 00:28:59,322
Watch out for this dame, D.B.
She'll drive you batty.

631
00:28:59,405 --> 00:29:00,157
- Oh--
- Look, we can't let them

632
00:29:00,241 --> 00:29:02,243
get to this bush league pitcher
and start pumping him.

633
00:29:02,326 --> 00:29:05,122
Good night! No telling
what that screwball might do.

634
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:06,290
I walk in yesterday,

635
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:09,670
here he is standing on a table
with a fishing pole, fly-casting.

636
00:29:10,003 --> 00:29:12,924
Take my advice and get him out of town
before this thing explodes in our faces.

637
00:29:13,007 --> 00:29:15,970
If you do, Mr. Norton, you're just as much
of a dumb cluck as he is, excuse me.

638
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:17,806
Now you got yourself a meal ticket
and you hate to let it go.

639
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,099
Sure, he's a meal ticket for me,
I admit it,

640
00:29:19,182 --> 00:29:21,352
but it's also a windfall
for somebody like Mr. Norton

641
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:22,896
who's trying to crash national politics.

642
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,273
That's what you bought
the newspaper for, isn't it?

643
00:29:24,356 --> 00:29:25,608
You want to reach
a lot of people, don't you?

644
00:29:25,692 --> 00:29:28,863
Well, put John Doe on the air
and you can reach 130 million of 'em.

645
00:29:28,946 --> 00:29:30,907
He can say anything
he wants and they'll listen to him.

646
00:29:30,991 --> 00:29:32,617
All right, we'll forget
the Governor and the Mayor

647
00:29:32,701 --> 00:29:33,786
and all the small fry like that.

648
00:29:33,870 --> 00:29:35,872
This can arouse national interest.

649
00:29:35,955 --> 00:29:39,084
If he made a hit around here, he can do it
every place else in the country,

650
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:42,005
and you'll be pulling
the strings, Mr. Norton.

651
00:29:44,633 --> 00:29:46,970
Go down to the office and
arrange for some radio time.

652
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:49,223
- But D.B., you're not gonna fall--
- I want it as soon as possible.

653
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:55,648
Okay, I just came in to get warm myself.

654
00:29:55,982 --> 00:29:57,109
Come on, let's go.

655
00:29:57,985 --> 00:29:58,986
Don't you go.

656
00:29:59,069 --> 00:30:00,197
I want to talk to you.

657
00:30:06,747 --> 00:30:07,664
Sit down.

658
00:30:24,939 --> 00:30:27,691
This John Doe idea was yours, huh?

659
00:30:28,235 --> 00:30:29,152
Yes, sir.

660
00:30:36,036 --> 00:30:37,121
How much money do you get?

661
00:30:37,205 --> 00:30:38,248
30 dollars.

662
00:30:38,915 --> 00:30:40,000
30 dollars.

663
00:30:41,126 --> 00:30:43,129
Well, what are you after?

664
00:30:43,213 --> 00:30:46,008
I mean, what do you want,
a journalistic career?

665
00:30:46,092 --> 00:30:46,926
Money.

666
00:30:47,844 --> 00:30:48,679
Money.

667
00:30:48,929 --> 00:30:51,432
Well, I'm glad to hear somebody admit it.

668
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:56,982
Do you suppose
you could write a radio speech

669
00:30:57,065 --> 00:30:58,733
that would put that fellow over?

670
00:30:58,817 --> 00:30:59,986
Oh, I'm sure I can.

671
00:31:00,069 --> 00:31:01,654
Do it and I'll give you
100 dollars a week.

672
00:31:02,072 --> 00:31:03,740
- 100 dollars a--
- That's only the beginning.

673
00:31:04,533 --> 00:31:05,868
You play your cards right

674
00:31:05,952 --> 00:31:07,746
and you'll never have to worry
about money again.

675
00:31:08,372 --> 00:31:09,623
Oh, I knew it.

676
00:31:09,707 --> 00:31:10,458
- Hello.
- Hello.

677
00:31:10,542 --> 00:31:12,711
Whenever there's a pretty woman around.

678
00:31:12,794 --> 00:31:14,672
This is my nephew,
Ted Sheldon, Miss Mitchell.

679
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:15,965
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

680
00:31:16,048 --> 00:31:17,801
All right,
Casanova, I'll give you a break.

681
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:19,679
See that Miss Mitchell
gets a car to take her home.

682
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:21,932
Always reading my mind, aren't you?

683
00:31:22,599 --> 00:31:24,435
Thank you very much for everything.

684
00:31:25,228 --> 00:31:29,483
And Miss Mitchell, I think from now on,
you'd better work directly with me.

685
00:31:30,234 --> 00:31:31,153
Yes, sir.

686
00:31:52,181 --> 00:31:52,973
Ahh!

687
00:32:03,946 --> 00:32:06,283
Hey!

688
00:32:06,367 --> 00:32:08,453
Oh! I thought you were asleep.

689
00:32:08,536 --> 00:32:09,329
Good night, sis!

690
00:32:09,412 --> 00:32:10,289
We just wanted to say good night.

691
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:12,833
You little brats, you're just stalling.

692
00:32:12,917 --> 00:32:14,419
I said good night.

693
00:32:14,503 --> 00:32:16,381
Come, come, come, children.

694
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:17,423
It's past your bedtime.

695
00:32:17,507 --> 00:32:18,383
- Now, go on.
- Go on.

696
00:32:18,466 --> 00:32:21,930
- Oh, all right.
- Come on, come on. Come on, come on.

697
00:32:22,389 --> 00:32:24,517
Stick a fork through me, I'm done.

698
00:32:24,600 --> 00:32:26,310
I'll never get this speech right.

699
00:32:26,394 --> 00:32:27,729
Oh yes you will, Ann dear.

700
00:32:27,813 --> 00:32:28,980
You're very clever.

701
00:32:29,064 --> 00:32:30,316
Yeah, I know.

702
00:32:30,400 --> 00:32:31,401
What are you looking for?

703
00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:33,028
Your purse. I need 10 dollars.

704
00:32:33,112 --> 00:32:35,406
What for?
I gave you 50 just the other day.

705
00:32:35,489 --> 00:32:38,076
Yes, I know, clear,
but Mrs. Burke had her baby yesterday.

706
00:32:38,159 --> 00:32:41,205
Nine pounds, and there
wasn't a thing in the house,

707
00:32:41,288 --> 00:32:42,791
and then the Community Chest lady came.

708
00:32:42,874 --> 00:32:44,210
And the 50's all gone, huh?

709
00:32:44,293 --> 00:32:45,503
Who's the 10 for?

710
00:32:45,586 --> 00:32:46,921
- The Websters.
- The Websters.

711
00:32:47,004 --> 00:32:49,884
You remember, those lovely people
your father used to take care of?

712
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:51,886
I thought I'd buy them some groceries.

713
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:55,057
- Oh Ann, dear, it's a shame those poor--
- You're marvelous, Ma.

714
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,852
You're just like Father used to be.

715
00:32:56,935 --> 00:32:59,897
Do you realize a couple of weeks ago,
we didn't have enough to eat ourselves?

716
00:32:59,981 --> 00:33:02,985
Well, yes I know, dear,
but these people are in such need

717
00:33:03,067 --> 00:33:03,986
and we have plenty now.

718
00:33:04,069 --> 00:33:05,530
If you're thinking
of that thousand dollars, forget it.

719
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:06,655
It's practically all gone.

720
00:33:06,739 --> 00:33:08,284
We owed everybody in town.

721
00:33:08,367 --> 00:33:10,662
Now, you just gotta stop
giving all your money away.

722
00:33:10,744 --> 00:33:12,204
Oh, Ann dear.

723
00:33:12,289 --> 00:33:13,624
Oh, I'm sorry, Ma.

724
00:33:13,707 --> 00:33:15,793
Oh, don't pay any attention to me.

725
00:33:15,878 --> 00:33:18,005
I guess I'm just upset about all this.

726
00:33:18,339 --> 00:33:21,050
Jeepers, here I am with
a great opportunity to get somewhere,

727
00:33:21,134 --> 00:33:23,512
to give us security
for once in our lives, and I'm stuck.

728
00:33:23,596 --> 00:33:26,851
If I could put this over,
your Mrs. Burke can have six babies.

729
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:28,102
You mean this speech you're writing?

730
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:29,187
Yeah, I don't know.

731
00:33:29,270 --> 00:33:31,064
I simply can't get it to gel.

732
00:33:31,148 --> 00:33:33,610
I created somebody who's going to give up
his life for a principle.

733
00:33:33,693 --> 00:33:36,322
Hundreds of thousands of people
are going to listen to him over the radio,

734
00:33:36,405 --> 00:33:37,948
and unless he says something that's,

735
00:33:38,533 --> 00:33:40,785
well, that's sensational,
it's just no good.

736
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:42,914
Well, honey, of course
I don't know what kind of a speech

737
00:33:42,996 --> 00:33:44,457
you're trying to write,

738
00:33:44,750 --> 00:33:46,627
but judging from the samples I've read,

739
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,670
I don't think anybody'll listen.

740
00:33:48,755 --> 00:33:49,506
What?

741
00:33:50,132 --> 00:33:52,969
Darling, there are so many
complaining political speeches.

742
00:33:53,762 --> 00:33:57,225
People are tired of hearing nothing
but doom and despair on the radio.

743
00:33:57,307 --> 00:33:58,769
If you're going to have him say anything,

744
00:33:58,852 --> 00:34:01,523
why don't you let him
say something simple and real,

745
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,775
something with hope in it?

746
00:34:04,652 --> 00:34:06,947
Your father were alive,
he'd know what to say.

747
00:34:07,030 --> 00:34:09,365
Oh, yeah.

748
00:34:09,448 --> 00:34:11,368
Father certainly would.

749
00:34:12,496 --> 00:34:14,081
- Wait a minute.
- Hm?

750
00:34:31,311 --> 00:34:33,106
That's your father's diary, Ann.

751
00:34:33,189 --> 00:34:34,316
Father's--?

752
00:34:34,399 --> 00:34:36,569
I never knew he had a diary.

753
00:34:36,652 --> 00:34:38,613
There's enough in it for 100 speeches,

754
00:34:38,905 --> 00:34:40,615
things people ought to hear nowadays.

755
00:34:41,535 --> 00:34:43,203
You be careful of it, won't you, dear?

756
00:34:43,746 --> 00:34:46,123
It's always helped
to keep your father alive for me.

757
00:34:46,206 --> 00:34:47,959
You bet I will, Ma.

758
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,843
Wait a minute.
John Doe don't want to sign no autographs.

759
00:34:53,925 --> 00:34:54,843
Well, what does he do all day?

760
00:34:54,926 --> 00:34:56,887
What does he do all day?

761
00:34:56,971 --> 00:34:59,767
He's writing out his memories.

762
00:34:59,851 --> 00:35:01,353
Sorry, lady, you can't see Mr. Doe.

763
00:35:01,437 --> 00:35:02,770
He wants to be alone.

764
00:35:02,855 --> 00:35:07,153
No. No, he just sits around all day
and commutes with himself.

765
00:35:12,868 --> 00:35:13,703
Ball!

766
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:25,093
I don't know how you're gonna stand it

767
00:35:25,177 --> 00:35:26,721
around here 'til after Christmas.

768
00:35:30,934 --> 00:35:33,270
I'll bet you ain't heard
a train whistle in two weeks.

769
00:35:41,574 --> 00:35:43,117
Stee-rike!

770
00:35:56,677 --> 00:35:58,055
I know why you're hanging around.

771
00:36:05,481 --> 00:36:06,900
You're stuck on the girl.

772
00:36:10,153 --> 00:36:12,949
That's all a guy needs is
to get hooked up with a woman.

773
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:31,473
What was that, a single?

774
00:36:32,643 --> 00:36:33,936
First baseman dropped the ball.

775
00:36:34,812 --> 00:36:36,147
Butterfingers!

776
00:36:36,647 --> 00:36:37,692
Tough luck, pal.

777
00:36:44,116 --> 00:36:46,537
Guy has a woman on his hands,
first thing he knows,

778
00:36:46,619 --> 00:36:49,248
his life is balled up
with a lot more things.

779
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:51,042
Furniture and...

780
00:37:02,433 --> 00:37:03,185
Did you get him?

781
00:37:04,686 --> 00:37:05,686
You're out!

782
00:37:05,772 --> 00:37:06,689
Swell.

783
00:37:07,356 --> 00:37:08,356
What's this, the end of the eighth?

784
00:37:08,441 --> 00:37:09,234
Ninth.

785
00:37:13,948 --> 00:37:16,701
Hey Beany, there's a couple of mugs from
the <i>Chronicle</i> snooping around out here.

786
00:37:16,786 --> 00:37:18,037
Ha!

787
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:22,335
Come on, Angelface.

788
00:37:24,170 --> 00:37:25,422
Gangway.

789
00:37:25,505 --> 00:37:26,549
What's the score, Angelface?

790
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:27,966
Three to two, our favor.

791
00:37:28,051 --> 00:37:29,302
Gee, that's great!

792
00:37:36,145 --> 00:37:37,271
Hey, you got swell form there.

793
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:38,564
Must have been a pretty good pitcher.

794
00:37:39,106 --> 00:37:41,027
Pretty good? Say, I was just about
ready for the major leagues

795
00:37:41,109 --> 00:37:43,030
when I chipped a bone in my elbow.

796
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:45,074
I got it pitching a 19-inning game.

797
00:37:45,157 --> 00:37:46,076
19?

798
00:37:46,158 --> 00:37:46,993
Yeah.

799
00:37:47,076 --> 00:37:49,329
There was a Major League scout
there watching me too,

800
00:37:49,413 --> 00:37:51,290
and he came down
after the game with a contract.

801
00:37:52,084 --> 00:37:53,084
You know what?

802
00:37:53,544 --> 00:37:55,213
I couldn't lift my arm to sign it.

803
00:37:56,338 --> 00:37:58,133
I'll be okay though,
soon as I get it fixed up.

804
00:37:58,216 --> 00:37:59,176
Yeah, it's too bad.

805
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:01,596
What do you mean, too bad?

806
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:02,722
Huh?

807
00:38:02,807 --> 00:38:04,559
Oh, that you'll never
be able to play again.

808
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:06,103
What are you talking about?

809
00:38:06,185 --> 00:38:07,520
I just told you I was gonna get my--

810
00:38:07,603 --> 00:38:10,525
You know how they are in baseball
if a guy's mixed up in a racket.

811
00:38:11,652 --> 00:38:12,736
Racket? What do you mean?

812
00:38:13,444 --> 00:38:16,365
Well, I was just thinking
about this John Doe business.

813
00:38:16,449 --> 00:38:18,785
Why, as soon as
it comes out it's all a fake,

814
00:38:19,078 --> 00:38:21,164
you'll be washed up in baseball,
won't you?

815
00:38:24,042 --> 00:38:25,002
Yeah.

816
00:38:27,464 --> 00:38:29,593
Doggone, I never thought about that.

817
00:38:35,851 --> 00:38:37,103
- Gosh!
- And another thing,

818
00:38:37,185 --> 00:38:38,812
what about all the kids in the country?

819
00:38:38,897 --> 00:38:41,191
The kids that idolize ball players?

820
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:42,861
What are they gonna think about ya?

821
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:45,322
Yeah.

822
00:38:46,157 --> 00:38:47,074
Hey, Colonel.

823
00:38:50,287 --> 00:38:51,163
Did you hear that?

824
00:38:51,873 --> 00:38:54,167
I gotta figure some way out of this thing.

825
00:38:54,752 --> 00:38:56,128
Elevators are still running.

826
00:38:56,880 --> 00:38:59,090
I know one way you can do it.

827
00:38:59,174 --> 00:39:00,300
-[music 5 tops -How? 1

828
00:39:01,427 --> 00:39:02,638
Well, when you get up there on the radio,

829
00:39:02,721 --> 00:39:05,141
all you have to do is say
the whole thing's a frame-up.

830
00:39:05,557 --> 00:39:07,727
Make you a hero, sure as you're born.

831
00:39:08,895 --> 00:39:11,191
Yeah, but how am I gonna get my arm fixed?

832
00:39:11,608 --> 00:39:12,858
That's a cinch.

833
00:39:13,525 --> 00:39:16,614
I know somebody who'll give you
5,000 dollars just to get up on the radio

834
00:39:16,697 --> 00:39:17,866
and tell the truth.

835
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:19,034
5,000 dollars?

836
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:22,538
Yeah, 5,000 dollars
and he gets it right away.

837
00:39:22,623 --> 00:39:24,041
You don't have to wait 'til Christmas.

838
00:39:25,084 --> 00:39:27,837
Look out, Long John,
they're closing in on you.

839
00:39:29,339 --> 00:39:30,800
Say, who's putting up this dough?

840
00:39:31,843 --> 00:39:33,220
Fella runs <i>the Chronicle.</i>

841
00:39:35,473 --> 00:39:37,809
Here's the speech you make
and it's all written out for you.

842
00:39:39,980 --> 00:39:43,525
5,000 dollars. Holy mackerel!

843
00:39:43,608 --> 00:39:46,738
I can see the heelots coming,
the whole army of them.

844
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:51,245
It's on the level.

845
00:40:02,927 --> 00:40:05,763
No, I'm sorry, tickets for
the broadcast are all gone.

846
00:40:05,848 --> 00:40:06,973
Phone the <i>Bulletin.</i>

847
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:08,601
Sorry, no more tickets left.

848
00:40:20,743 --> 00:40:22,704
Hello, John, all set for the big night?

849
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:24,372
- Swell!
- Turn around.

850
00:40:24,456 --> 00:40:25,540
- One moment, Mr. Doe.
- Now stand still.

851
00:40:25,623 --> 00:40:27,460
- Hold it, Mr. Doe.
- Big smile, Mr. Doe.

852
00:40:27,543 --> 00:40:29,421
- That's swell.
- Okay, Beany, that's enough, take 'em out.

853
00:40:32,091 --> 00:40:33,385
Now look, John, here's the speech.

854
00:40:33,469 --> 00:40:34,552
It's in caps and double spaced.

855
00:40:34,635 --> 00:40:35,971
You won't have any trouble reading it.

856
00:40:36,055 --> 00:40:37,640
- Not nervous, are you?
- No.

857
00:40:37,723 --> 00:40:38,893
Of course not. He wouldn't be.

858
00:40:39,143 --> 00:40:40,978
- Who?
- John Doe, the one in there.

859
00:40:41,061 --> 00:40:42,939
Hey, don't let your knees rattle.
It picks up on the mic.

860
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:44,066
Oh, Beany.

861
00:40:44,149 --> 00:40:45,525
You needn't be nervous, John.

862
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,195
All you have to remember is to be sincere.

863
00:40:47,277 --> 00:40:48,613
Pick up that phone, Miss Mitchell.
It's for you.

864
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:50,198
Okay. Hello?

865
00:40:50,283 --> 00:40:51,241
Yes, Mother.

866
00:40:51,493 --> 00:40:52,493
Oh, thank you, darling.

867
00:40:52,576 --> 00:40:54,789
Oh, there he is, the poor dear man.

868
00:40:54,872 --> 00:40:57,459
Oh, good luck to you, Mr. Doe.

869
00:40:57,542 --> 00:40:59,753
We want you to know
that we're all for you.

870
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:01,547
The girls all decided--

871
00:41:01,630 --> 00:41:05,136
...that you're not to jump off
any roof at all.

872
00:41:06,762 --> 00:41:08,849
- You got the speech I gave ya?
- Yeah.

873
00:41:10,310 --> 00:41:12,686
Now look, I'll give
this money to the Colonel

874
00:41:12,771 --> 00:41:14,314
just as soon as you get started.

875
00:41:14,398 --> 00:41:16,360
We'll have a car waiting
at the side entrance for you.

876
00:41:16,442 --> 00:41:17,986
- Okay.
- How'd you get in here?

877
00:41:18,069 --> 00:41:19,905
Huh? Oh, I just came in to wish him luck.

878
00:41:19,988 --> 00:41:21,282
Come on, out, out!

879
00:41:22,243 --> 00:41:23,743
Mother says good luck, too.

880
00:41:23,828 --> 00:41:27,206
John, when you read that speech,
please, please believe every word of it.

881
00:41:27,290 --> 00:41:29,460
He's turned out to be
a wonderful person, John.

882
00:41:29,544 --> 00:41:31,338
- Who?
- John Doe, the one in the speech.

883
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:33,006
- Oh.
- You know something?

884
00:41:33,091 --> 00:41:35,676
I... I've actually fallen in love with him.

885
00:41:36,554 --> 00:41:38,597
All right, there he is, sister.
Now come on, plenty of oomph.

886
00:41:38,682 --> 00:41:40,725
- What's the idea?
- No, no, no, that's too much.

887
00:41:40,809 --> 00:41:42,895
That's not--that's not--
no, no, not so much.

888
00:41:42,978 --> 00:41:43,813
Come on.

889
00:41:43,895 --> 00:41:46,400
Oh, this is no time for
cheap publicity, Mr. Connell.

890
00:41:46,483 --> 00:41:49,404
Listen, if that guy lays an egg,
I want to get something out of it.

891
00:41:49,487 --> 00:41:50,990
I'm getting a Jane Doe ready.

892
00:41:51,072 --> 00:41:53,076
Oh, come on, will you fellas?
Give me a chance.

893
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,996
That's fine honey, you go ahead.

894
00:41:58,291 --> 00:41:59,376
How you doing?

895
00:41:59,459 --> 00:42:01,378
All right, Beany, bring them in.

896
00:42:01,462 --> 00:42:03,672
Holy smoke, a half a heelot.

897
00:42:04,591 --> 00:42:06,093
There you are,
boss, just like you ordered.

898
00:42:06,176 --> 00:42:07,261
Symbols of little people.

899
00:42:07,344 --> 00:42:08,388
Okay, get 'em up.

900
00:42:08,471 --> 00:42:09,306
All right, little fella.

901
00:42:09,389 --> 00:42:10,557
This is ridiculous, Mr. Connell.

902
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:11,517
Come on, give me a chance.

903
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:12,728
The man's on the air pretty soon.

904
00:42:14,270 --> 00:42:16,523
I told you, you'll get
all the pictures you want after.

905
00:42:16,608 --> 00:42:18,233
No, come on, after.

906
00:42:18,318 --> 00:42:20,361
Come on, come on, that's right.

907
00:42:20,446 --> 00:42:22,740
Afterwards, you can
get all the pictures you want.

908
00:42:22,824 --> 00:42:23,992
- Thank you very much.
- Come on, will ya?

909
00:42:24,076 --> 00:42:26,245
- That's right.
- Come on, Snooks, you better bail out.

910
00:42:26,662 --> 00:42:28,206
Okay, goodbye, Mr. Doe.

911
00:42:28,665 --> 00:42:30,877
- Beany!
- All right, all right.

912
00:42:33,214 --> 00:42:34,797
Better get ready. One minute to go.

913
00:42:34,882 --> 00:42:36,676
Wow, one minute to go,
and the score's nothing to nothing.

914
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:40,139
Now please, John,
you won't let me down, will ya?

915
00:42:41,807 --> 00:42:42,642
Will ya?

916
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:45,145
Of course you won't.

917
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:48,775
If you'll just think of yourself
as the real John Doe.

918
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,444
Listen, everything
in that speech are things

919
00:42:50,528 --> 00:42:52,446
a certain man believed in.

920
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:56,912
He was my father, John,
and when he talked, people listened,

921
00:42:57,245 --> 00:42:58,790
and they'll listen to you, too.

922
00:43:00,083 --> 00:43:03,629
Funny, you know what
my mother said the other night?

923
00:43:04,505 --> 00:43:06,466
She said to look into your eyes,

924
00:43:06,549 --> 00:43:07,927
that I'd see Father there.

925
00:43:10,806 --> 00:43:11,723
Hey, what do you say?

926
00:43:11,806 --> 00:43:13,434
Okay, we're coming. Come on.

927
00:43:14,351 --> 00:43:15,228
Now, listen, John.

928
00:43:15,312 --> 00:43:16,397
You're a pitcher.

929
00:43:16,480 --> 00:43:17,855
Now get in there and pitch.

930
00:43:19,775 --> 00:43:21,069
Good luck.

931
00:43:21,153 --> 00:43:22,988
Give him room, let him through.
Come on.

932
00:43:37,549 --> 00:43:38,969
Hey, let's get outta here.

933
00:43:39,052 --> 00:43:40,012
There's the door right there.

934
00:43:40,095 --> 00:43:41,055
Hey, what are you doing here?

935
00:43:41,138 --> 00:43:42,348
That's what I'd like to know.

936
00:43:42,431 --> 00:43:43,223
Come on, out, out!

937
00:43:43,308 --> 00:43:44,268
Hey, he's a friend of mine.

938
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:46,436
Never mind, let him alone. He's all right.

939
00:43:48,897 --> 00:43:50,568
I'll be right over there pulling for you.

940
00:43:53,988 --> 00:43:55,408
No, John, over here.

941
00:44:00,873 --> 00:44:01,623
Stand by.

942
00:44:33,709 --> 00:44:36,380
Phone the <i>Chronicle.</i> Tell 'em to start
getting those extras out.

943
00:44:58,826 --> 00:45:00,161
And good evening, ladies and gentlemen.

944
00:45:00,245 --> 00:45:02,498
This is Kenneth Fry
speaking for The New Bulletin.

945
00:45:02,581 --> 00:45:05,210
Tonight, we give you something
entirely new and different.

946
00:45:05,544 --> 00:45:07,255
Standing beside me is the young man

947
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:09,591
who has declared publicly
that on Christmas Eve

948
00:45:09,674 --> 00:45:13,012
he intends to commit suicide,
giving as his reason, quote,

949
00:45:13,554 --> 00:45:16,057
"I protest against
the state of civilization."

950
00:45:16,142 --> 00:45:17,184
End quote.

951
00:45:17,267 --> 00:45:19,353
Ladies and gentlemen,
The New <i>Bulletin</i> takes pleasure

952
00:45:19,438 --> 00:45:21,231
in presenting the man who is fast becoming

953
00:45:21,314 --> 00:45:25,194
the most talked-up person
in the whole country, John Doe!

954
00:45:48,728 --> 00:45:50,020
Ladies and gentlemen,

955
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:55,862
I am the man you all know as John Doe.

956
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:00,702
I took that name
because it seems to describe...

957
00:46:03,414 --> 00:46:07,461
because it seems to describe the
average man, and that's me.

958
00:46:08,838 --> 00:46:09,880
...and that's me.

959
00:46:14,135 --> 00:46:17,056
Well, it was me before
I said I was going to jump off

960
00:46:17,139 --> 00:46:20,020
the City Hall roof
at midnight on Christmas Eve.

961
00:46:21,230 --> 00:46:23,358
Now I guess I'm not average anymore.

962
00:46:24,733 --> 00:46:28,071
Now I'm getting all sorts
of attention from big shots too.

963
00:46:28,154 --> 00:46:28,990
We've been double crossed.

964
00:46:29,074 --> 00:46:30,199
- We have.
- The Mayor

965
00:46:30,282 --> 00:46:31,452
and Governor, for instance,

966
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,663
they don't like those articles
I've been writing.

967
00:46:33,745 --> 00:46:35,456
You're an impostor, young fella!

968
00:46:35,791 --> 00:46:37,252
That's a pack of lies you're telling!

969
00:46:38,836 --> 00:46:40,172
Who wrote that speech for you?

970
00:46:42,883 --> 00:46:43,802
Beany, get that guy!

971
00:46:51,980 --> 00:46:53,647
This is a publicity stunt
for the <i>Bulletin!</i>

972
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:55,693
Spencer.

973
00:46:55,775 --> 00:46:57,821
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
the disturbance you just heard</i>

974
00:46:57,904 --> 00:47:01,157
<i>was caused by someone in the audience
who tried to heckle Mr. Doe.</i>

975
00:47:01,617 --> 00:47:03,328
The speech will continue.

976
00:47:07,833 --> 00:47:11,297
Well, people like the Governor,

977
00:47:11,839 --> 00:47:15,635
people like the Governor
and that fella there can stop worrying.

978
00:47:15,720 --> 00:47:17,763
I'm not gonna talk about them.

979
00:47:17,848 --> 00:47:22,478
I'm gonna talk about us,
the average guys, the John Does.

980
00:47:23,187 --> 00:47:26,443
If anybody should ask you
what the average John Doe is like,

981
00:47:26,818 --> 00:47:30,156
you couldn't tell him
because he's a million and one things.

982
00:47:30,823 --> 00:47:33,159
He's Mr. Big and Mr. Small.

983
00:47:33,409 --> 00:47:35,204
He's simple and he's wise.

984
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:36,539
He's inherently honest,

985
00:47:36,832 --> 00:47:38,792
but he's got a streak
of larceny in his heart.

986
00:47:39,043 --> 00:47:40,753
He seldom walks up to a public telephone

987
00:47:40,836 --> 00:47:42,797
without shoving
his finger in the slot to see

988
00:47:42,882 --> 00:47:44,799
if somebody left a nickel there.

989
00:47:56,482 --> 00:47:59,320
He's the man the ads are written for,

990
00:47:59,402 --> 00:48:01,907
he's the feller everybody sells things to.

991
00:48:02,366 --> 00:48:05,412
He's Joe Dokes,
the world's greatest stooge,

992
00:48:05,954 --> 00:48:07,747
and the world's greatest strength.

993
00:48:16,969 --> 00:48:18,179
Yes, sir.

994
00:48:19,347 --> 00:48:22,100
Yes, sir,
we're a great family, the John Does.

995
00:48:22,183 --> 00:48:26,272
We're the meek who are--who are
supposed to inherit the Earth.

996
00:48:26,941 --> 00:48:28,652
You'll find us everywhere.

997
00:48:28,735 --> 00:48:31,363
We raise the crops,
we dig the mines, work the factories,

998
00:48:31,447 --> 00:48:34,743
keep the books,
fly the planes, and drive the buses,

999
00:48:34,826 --> 00:48:37,372
and when a cop yells,
"Stand back there, you,"

1000
00:48:37,454 --> 00:48:39,750
he means us, the John Does.

1001
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,042
What kind of a speech is that?

1002
00:48:41,127 --> 00:48:42,336
Didn't you read it?

1003
00:48:42,421 --> 00:48:44,380
We've existed since time began.

1004
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:48,262
We built the pyramids,
we saw Christ crucified,

1005
00:48:48,344 --> 00:48:50,556
pulled the oars for Roman emperors,

1006
00:48:50,932 --> 00:48:52,350
sailed the boats for Columbus,

1007
00:48:53,017 --> 00:48:55,271
retreated from Moscow with Napoleon,

1008
00:48:55,688 --> 00:48:58,149
and froze with Washington at Valley Forge.

1009
00:49:01,279 --> 00:49:04,407
Yes, sir, we've been
in there dodging left hooks

1010
00:49:04,490 --> 00:49:07,036
since before history began to walk.

1011
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:08,622
In our struggle for freedom,

1012
00:49:08,706 --> 00:49:10,291
we've hit the canvas many a time,

1013
00:49:10,374 --> 00:49:13,588
but we always bounce back
because we're the people and we're tough.

1014
00:49:19,387 --> 00:49:21,764
They've started a lot of talk
about free people going soft,

1015
00:49:22,099 --> 00:49:23,434
that we can't take it.

1016
00:49:23,517 --> 00:49:24,978
That's a lot of hooey!

1017
00:49:26,020 --> 00:49:28,566
A free people can beat
the world at anything from war

1018
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:31,527
to tiddlywinks if we all
pull in the same direction.

1019
00:49:39,956 --> 00:49:41,666
I know a lot of you are saying,

1020
00:49:41,750 --> 00:49:43,044
"What can I do?

1021
00:49:43,127 --> 00:49:44,504
I'm just a little punk.

1022
00:49:44,587 --> 00:49:45,797
I don't count."

1023
00:49:46,130 --> 00:49:47,007
Well, you're dead wrong.

1024
00:49:47,090 --> 00:49:48,468
The little punks have always counted

1025
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:50,763
because in the long run,
the character of a country

1026
00:49:50,846 --> 00:49:54,184
is the sum total of
the character of its little punks.

1027
00:50:01,651 --> 00:50:03,696
<i>But we've all got to
get in there and pitch.</i>

1028
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:06,450
<i>We can't win the old ball game
unless we have teamwork,</i>

1029
00:50:06,909 --> 00:50:09,955
<i>and that's where every John Doe comes in.</i>

1030
00:50:10,038 --> 00:50:12,958
<i>It's up to him to get together
with his teammate,</i>

1031
00:50:13,377 --> 00:50:18,007
<i>and your teammate, my friends,
is the guy next door to you.</i>

1032
00:50:18,090 --> 00:50:20,343
<i>Your neighbor,
he's a terribly important guy,</i>

1033
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:22,346
<i>that guy next door.</i>

1034
00:50:22,429 --> 00:50:24,140
<i>You're gonna need him
and he's gonna need you,</i>

1035
00:50:24,223 --> 00:50:25,601
<i>so look him up.</i>

1036
00:50:25,684 --> 00:50:27,562
<i>If he's sick, call on him.</i>

1037
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:29,272
<i>If he's hungry, feed him.</i>

1038
00:50:29,565 --> 00:50:31,860
<i>If he's out of a job, find him one.</i>

1039
00:50:32,735 --> 00:50:34,821
To most of you,
your neighbor is a stranger,

1040
00:50:34,904 --> 00:50:37,659
a guy with a barking dog
and a high fence around him.

1041
00:50:37,909 --> 00:50:39,453
Now, you can't be a stranger to any guy

1042
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:41,205
that's on your own team.

1043
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:43,958
So tear down the fence that separates you.

1044
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:45,836
Tear down the fence,

1045
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:48,632
and you'll tear down a lot of hates
and prejudices.

1046
00:50:48,716 --> 00:50:50,468
Tear down all the fences in the country,

1047
00:50:50,552 --> 00:50:52,345
and you'll really have teamwork.

1048
00:51:01,024 --> 00:51:03,443
I know a lot of
you are saying to yourselves,

1049
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:05,155
"He's asking for a miracle to happen.

1050
00:51:05,238 --> 00:51:08,117
He's expecting people
to change all of a sudden."

1051
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:10,329
Well, you're wrong.
It's no miracle.

1052
00:51:10,412 --> 00:51:14,417
<i>It's no miracle, because
I see it happen once every year</i>

1053
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:17,379
and so do you, at Christmas time.

1054
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:20,926
There's something swell
about the spirit of Christmas,

1055
00:51:21,343 --> 00:51:24,181
to see what it does to people,
all kinds of people.

1056
00:51:25,098 --> 00:51:28,894
Now why can't that spirit,
that same warm Christmas spirit,

1057
00:51:28,978 --> 00:51:30,647
last the whole year round?

1058
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:34,194
Gosh, if it ever did,

1059
00:51:34,735 --> 00:51:40,034
if each and every John Doe would make
that spirit last 365 days out of the year,

1060
00:51:40,118 --> 00:51:41,620
we'd develop such a strength,

1061
00:51:41,704 --> 00:51:43,914
we'd create such a tidal wave of goodwill

1062
00:51:43,997 --> 00:51:46,418
that no human force
could stand against it.

1063
00:51:48,338 --> 00:51:49,713
Yes sir, my friends,

1064
00:51:50,716 --> 00:51:53,010
the meek can only inherit the Earth

1065
00:51:53,095 --> 00:51:55,848
when the John Does
start loving their neighbors.

1066
00:51:56,890 --> 00:51:58,559
You better start right now.

1067
00:51:59,311 --> 00:52:02,189
Don't wait 'til the game is called
on account of darkness.

1068
00:52:03,857 --> 00:52:06,237
Wake up, John Doe,
you're the hope of the world.

1069
00:52:15,333 --> 00:52:16,500
John, you were wonderful.

1070
00:52:24,804 --> 00:52:26,765
- Let's get out of here.
- Now you're talking.

1071
00:52:31,646 --> 00:52:33,649
Gangway, you heelots!

1072
00:52:46,206 --> 00:52:47,877
I knew you'd wake up sooner or later.

1073
00:52:49,127 --> 00:52:51,130
Boy, am I glad we got out of that mess.

1074
00:52:52,007 --> 00:52:53,801
I had the 5,000 bucks sewed up.

1075
00:52:53,885 --> 00:52:55,887
Could've been on my way to 'ol Doc Brown.

1076
00:52:58,390 --> 00:53:00,978
"You're a pitcher, John," she says.
"Now go in there and pitch."

1077
00:53:01,270 --> 00:53:02,313
What a sucker!

1078
00:53:02,396 --> 00:53:04,524
Eh, she's a heelot
just like the rest of 'em.

1079
00:53:04,608 --> 00:53:06,193
It's lucky you got away from her.

1080
00:53:06,276 --> 00:53:08,279
What was I doing up there
making a speech, anyway?

1081
00:53:08,362 --> 00:53:09,197
Me, huh?

1082
00:53:09,655 --> 00:53:11,617
Geez, the more I think about it,
the more I could--

1083
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:13,161
Tear down all the fences!

1084
00:53:13,243 --> 00:53:16,331
Why, if you tore one picket off of
your neighbor's fence, he'd sue you.

1085
00:53:16,749 --> 00:53:18,877
5,000 bucks, had it right in my hand.

1086
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:20,337
What do you mean, he ran away?

1087
00:53:20,419 --> 00:53:22,048
Well, go after him, find him.

1088
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:23,174
That man is terrific.

1089
00:53:32,062 --> 00:53:34,063
Columbia River, here we come!

1090
00:54:22,713 --> 00:54:23,922
Jitterbugs.

1091
00:54:24,007 --> 00:54:25,175
Yeah.

1092
00:54:25,257 --> 00:54:27,928
Say, how much money we got left?

1093
00:54:28,012 --> 00:54:29,096
Four bits.

1094
00:54:29,181 --> 00:54:30,181
Better make it doughnuts, huh?

1095
00:54:30,265 --> 00:54:31,016
Yeah.

1096
00:54:43,574 --> 00:54:44,492
What'll it be, gents?

1097
00:54:45,409 --> 00:54:47,787
Have you got a couple of steaks
about that big and that thick?

1098
00:54:47,872 --> 00:54:50,708
Yeah, with hash brown potatoes
and tomatoes

1099
00:54:50,791 --> 00:54:53,421
and apple pie and ice cream and coffee?

1100
00:54:53,504 --> 00:54:55,466
And doughnuts, I know.

1101
00:54:55,549 --> 00:54:56,299
Hey, Ma!

1102
00:54:56,382 --> 00:54:57,968
Sinkers, a pair.

1103
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:59,970
Sinkers, a pair, comin' up.

1104
00:55:00,055 --> 00:55:01,515
Glad he took the "T" out of that.

1105
00:55:07,022 --> 00:55:08,607
Hey, look.

1106
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:11,696
"Join the John Doe Club."

1107
00:55:13,156 --> 00:55:14,323
John Doe Club?

1108
00:55:20,208 --> 00:55:21,083
Uh-oh.

1109
00:55:24,129 --> 00:55:25,631
- Are you John Doe?
- Who?

1110
00:55:25,713 --> 00:55:27,842
- John Doe.
- Ah, you need glasses, buddy.

1111
00:55:27,926 --> 00:55:30,595
Ha! Well, gee--
It's the spitting image of John Doe.

1112
00:55:30,680 --> 00:55:31,890
Yeah, but his name is Willoughby.

1113
00:55:31,973 --> 00:55:33,767
Long John Willoughby.
I'm a baseball player.

1114
00:55:33,850 --> 00:55:34,601
Sure.

1115
00:55:34,686 --> 00:55:36,561
Oh no, I'd know that voice anywhere.

1116
00:55:36,646 --> 00:55:37,939
You can't kid me.

1117
00:55:38,691 --> 00:55:39,692
You're John Doe.

1118
00:55:40,193 --> 00:55:41,945
Hey, Ma, Ma!

1119
00:55:42,487 --> 00:55:43,321
That John Doe!

1120
00:55:43,406 --> 00:55:44,156
John Doe!

1121
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,076
Yeah, sitting right there, big as life.

1122
00:55:46,159 --> 00:55:47,201
Who'd you say it was?

1123
00:55:47,286 --> 00:55:49,205
John Doe, the big guy there.

1124
00:56:02,179 --> 00:56:04,017
Hey operator, Dan's beanery.

1125
00:56:04,308 --> 00:56:05,686
Call everybody in town.

1126
00:56:05,769 --> 00:56:07,313
John Doe was just in my place.

1127
00:56:07,646 --> 00:56:09,649
Yeah, he ordered doughnuts.

1128
00:56:23,792 --> 00:56:25,713
You're all here to see
John Doe and you're all neighbors,

1129
00:56:25,796 --> 00:56:27,590
but my office is
packed like a sardine box.

1130
00:56:27,673 --> 00:56:29,259
What does John Doe look like, Mr. Mayor?

1131
00:56:29,343 --> 00:56:31,887
Oh, he's one of those
great, big, outdoor type men.

1132
00:56:31,971 --> 00:56:34,140
No, you can't see him,
you didn't vote for me the last time.

1133
00:56:34,223 --> 00:56:35,309
Shame on you, what are you doing here?

1134
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,267
Get off my front porch anyhow.

1135
00:56:36,352 --> 00:56:38,063
Mr. Norton come yet?

1136
00:56:38,146 --> 00:56:39,774
I wonder where he's at,
what's keeping him?

1137
00:56:39,856 --> 00:56:40,941
He should've been here 15 minutes ago.

1138
00:56:41,024 --> 00:56:44,529
Oh, th--there he comes now.

1139
00:56:46,573 --> 00:56:47,742
Now everybody on your dignity.

1140
00:56:47,825 --> 00:56:50,120
Don't do anything to disgrace us,
a little town, but we gotta show off.

1141
00:56:53,458 --> 00:56:54,542
Better let me talk to him.

1142
00:56:54,627 --> 00:56:57,130
All right, but present it to him as
a great cause for the common man.

1143
00:56:57,213 --> 00:56:58,798
Oh, here he comes.
Give him room down there.

1144
00:56:58,882 --> 00:57:00,218
Give him room, folks.

1145
00:57:00,301 --> 00:57:02,471
Come on now, come on, here they come.

1146
00:57:02,554 --> 00:57:04,181
Here they come.
Here, Mr. Norton.

1147
00:57:04,264 --> 00:57:05,892
Here he comes.
How do you do, Mr. Norton?

1148
00:57:05,975 --> 00:57:07,102
I'm Mayor Hawkins.

1149
00:57:07,185 --> 00:57:08,728
Come back here!

1150
00:57:08,813 --> 00:57:09,980
Let me go, you darn fool.

1151
00:57:10,063 --> 00:57:10,815
I'm the Mayor.

1152
00:57:10,898 --> 00:57:13,401
Mr. Norton, Mr. Norton, Mr. Norton.

1153
00:57:13,485 --> 00:57:14,529
I'm Mayor Hawkins.

1154
00:57:14,612 --> 00:57:16,279
Your office telephoned me to hold him.

1155
00:57:16,364 --> 00:57:17,865
- That's fine. How is he?
- Oh, he's fine.

1156
00:57:17,950 --> 00:57:19,075
He's right in my office there.

1157
00:57:19,159 --> 00:57:21,578
You know, it's a big honor having
John Doe here, and you too.

1158
00:57:21,663 --> 00:57:24,416
Haven't had so much excitement
since the old City Hall burned down.

1159
00:57:24,499 --> 00:57:26,544
People so excited,
they nearly tore his clothes off.

1160
00:57:26,627 --> 00:57:28,297
Matilda, darling, phone the newspapers.

1161
00:57:28,380 --> 00:57:30,550
Tell them Mr. Norton's here.
Step right inside, Mr. Norton.

1162
00:57:30,632 --> 00:57:32,761
My office,
very comfortable here, Mr. Norton.

1163
00:57:32,845 --> 00:57:34,596
Just had it air-conditioned.
Gangway, please.

1164
00:57:34,681 --> 00:57:36,141
Make room for Mr. Norton.

1165
00:57:36,224 --> 00:57:37,767
Gangway, gangway.

1166
00:57:37,852 --> 00:57:39,563
Here he is,
Mr. Norton, well taken care of.

1167
00:57:39,645 --> 00:57:41,273
The neighbors are
serving him a light lunch.

1168
00:57:41,940 --> 00:57:42,733
Hello, John.

1169
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:45,904
Hello.

1170
00:57:46,321 --> 00:57:49,159
Mr. Mayor, if you don't mind,
we'd like to talk to him alone.

1171
00:57:49,242 --> 00:57:50,534
Why, certainly, certainly.

1172
00:57:50,617 --> 00:57:52,078
All right, everybody, clear out.

1173
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:53,497
Everybody, quickly now.

1174
00:57:56,711 --> 00:57:58,421
Come on. That's right.

1175
00:57:58,504 --> 00:58:00,632
That's right. That's right. Come on.

1176
00:58:01,717 --> 00:58:03,635
Don't argue with me here.

1177
00:58:03,720 --> 00:58:05,598
- Wait 'til we get home.
- Don't you push me around like that.

1178
00:58:05,681 --> 00:58:07,976
Even though I'm your wife,
you can't push me around!

1179
00:58:08,059 --> 00:58:09,977
Look, Mr. Norton,
I think you got a lot of nerve

1180
00:58:10,061 --> 00:58:11,647
having those people hold us here.

1181
00:58:12,147 --> 00:58:15,318
There's nobody holding you here, Mr. Doe.

1182
00:58:15,402 --> 00:58:16,613
It's only natural that you--

1183
00:58:16,696 --> 00:58:18,448
Well, if there's nobody
holding us here, let's get going.

1184
00:58:18,906 --> 00:58:20,909
Incidentally, my name isn't Doe.
It's Willoughby.

1185
00:58:20,992 --> 00:58:21,994
Look, John.

1186
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:23,622
Something terribly important's happened.

1187
00:58:23,705 --> 00:58:25,123
They're forming John Doe Clubs.

1188
00:58:25,208 --> 00:58:26,876
We know of eight already
and they say that there's--

1189
00:58:26,958 --> 00:58:28,544
- John Doe Clubs? What for?
- Mm-hmm.

1190
00:58:28,629 --> 00:58:30,965
To carry out the principles
you talked about in your radio speech.

1191
00:58:31,257 --> 00:58:32,257
I don't care what they're forming.

1192
00:58:32,342 --> 00:58:34,845
I'm on my way and I don't like
the idea of being stopped, either.

1193
00:58:34,928 --> 00:58:36,515
Oh, but you don't know
how big this thing is.

1194
00:58:36,598 --> 00:58:38,933
You should see
the thousands of telegrams we've received,

1195
00:58:39,016 --> 00:58:40,728
and what they're saying about you.

1196
00:58:40,811 --> 00:58:43,482
Look, it started as
a circulation stunt, didn't it?

1197
00:58:43,565 --> 00:58:44,732
Well, you got your circulation.

1198
00:58:44,817 --> 00:58:46,152
Now, why don't you let me alone?

1199
00:58:46,235 --> 00:58:48,821
Oh, it started as a circulation stunt
but it isn't anymore.

1200
00:58:48,906 --> 00:58:50,031
Mr. Norton wants to get back of it

1201
00:58:50,115 --> 00:58:52,077
and sponsor John Doe
clubs all over the country.

1202
00:58:52,159 --> 00:58:54,330
He wants to send you on a lecture tour.

1203
00:58:55,330 --> 00:58:56,333
- Me?
- Uh-huh.

1204
00:58:56,416 --> 00:58:57,417
Well certainly.

1205
00:58:57,500 --> 00:59:01,548
With your ability to influence people,
it might grow into a glorious movement.

1206
00:59:01,631 --> 00:59:03,049
Say, let's get something straight here.

1207
00:59:03,759 --> 00:59:05,679
I don't want any part of this thing.

1208
00:59:05,762 --> 00:59:09,683
If you got an idea I'm going around
lecturing to people, why, you're crazy.

1209
00:59:09,767 --> 00:59:11,979
Baseball's my racket
and I'm sticking to it.

1210
00:59:13,063 --> 00:59:14,816
Come on, Colonel, let's get out of here.

1211
00:59:14,899 --> 00:59:15,857
John, please.

1212
00:59:15,942 --> 00:59:18,237
Please, please,
I just got rid of one crowd.

1213
00:59:18,320 --> 00:59:22,743
But please, Mr. Mayor, tell him
the John Doe Club wants to talk to him.

1214
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:24,830
Let them in, Mr. Mayor, let them come in.

1215
00:59:25,122 --> 00:59:26,456
Okay, folks, but remember your manners.

1216
00:59:26,539 --> 00:59:27,792
No stampeding.

1217
00:59:27,875 --> 00:59:30,796
Walk slow, like you do
when you come to pay your taxes.

1218
00:59:38,097 --> 00:59:40,350
Okay, all right. Give me a chance.

1219
00:59:40,433 --> 00:59:41,769
Come right in.

1220
00:59:44,021 --> 00:59:45,732
My name's Bert Hansen, Mr. Doe.

1221
00:59:45,816 --> 00:59:48,945
I'm the head soda-jerker
at Schwabecker's drugstore.

1222
00:59:49,737 --> 00:59:51,907
Well, sir, you see, me and my wife,

1223
00:59:51,990 --> 00:59:54,995
we heard your broadcast
and we got quite a bang out of it,

1224
00:59:55,078 --> 00:59:56,204
especially my wife.

1225
00:59:56,289 --> 00:59:58,166
Kept me up half the night saying,

1226
00:59:58,249 --> 00:59:59,668
"That man's right, honey.

1227
00:59:59,752 --> 01:00:02,713
The trouble with the world is
nobody gives a hoot about his neighbor.

1228
01:00:02,796 --> 01:00:05,968
That's why everybody in town is
sore and cranky at each other."

1229
01:00:06,051 --> 01:00:09,722
And I kept saying, "Well, that's fine,
but how's a guy gonna go around

1230
01:00:09,806 --> 01:00:11,475
lovin' the kind of neighbors we got?"

1231
01:00:11,558 --> 01:00:13,978
Old Sourpuss, for instance.

1232
01:00:14,063 --> 01:00:17,776
You see, Sourpuss Smithers is a guy lives
all alone next door to us.

1233
01:00:17,859 --> 01:00:20,862
He's a cranky old man that runs
a second-hand furniture store.

1234
01:00:20,946 --> 01:00:22,865
We haven't spoken to him for years.

1235
01:00:23,783 --> 01:00:27,331
I always figured he was an ornery old gent
that hated the world

1236
01:00:27,414 --> 01:00:30,042
'cause he was always slamming
his garage door and

1237
01:00:30,125 --> 01:00:33,088
playing the radio so loud
he kept half the neighbors up.

1238
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:37,843
Well, anyway, the next morning
I'm out watering the lawn

1239
01:00:37,928 --> 01:00:40,472
and I look over and
there's Sourpuss on the other side

1240
01:00:40,556 --> 01:00:42,892
of the hedge,
straightening out a dent in his fender,

1241
01:00:43,644 --> 01:00:47,191
and my wife yells to me
out the window, says,

1242
01:00:47,274 --> 01:00:49,110
"Go on, speak to him, Bert,"

1243
01:00:49,193 --> 01:00:51,321
and I figured,
well heck, I can't lose anything,

1244
01:00:51,404 --> 01:00:52,948
so I yelled over to him,

1245
01:00:53,032 --> 01:00:54,492
"Good morning, Mr. Smithers."

1246
01:00:55,242 --> 01:00:57,328
He went right on pounding his fender.

1247
01:00:57,413 --> 01:00:59,541
Was I burned,
so I turned around to give my wife

1248
01:00:59,624 --> 01:01:01,836
a dirty look and she said,

1249
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:04,380
"Louder, louder, he didn't hear you."

1250
01:01:04,463 --> 01:01:07,301
So in a voice you could've heard
in the next county I yelled,

1251
01:01:07,385 --> 01:01:08,593
"Good morning, Mr. Smithers!"

1252
01:01:11,556 --> 01:01:14,102
Well, sir, you could have
knocked me over with a feather.

1253
01:01:14,185 --> 01:01:16,730
Old Sourpuss
turned around, surprised like,

1254
01:01:16,813 --> 01:01:18,733
and he put on a big smile,

1255
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:22,989
came over and took my hand
like an old lodge brother and he said,

1256
01:01:23,072 --> 01:01:24,324
"Good morning, Hansen.

1257
01:01:24,742 --> 01:01:26,492
I've been wanting
to talk to you for years,

1258
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:28,203
only I thought you didn't like me,"

1259
01:01:28,747 --> 01:01:31,250
and then he started
chatting away like a happy little kid,

1260
01:01:31,333 --> 01:01:33,377
and he got so excited his eyes...

1261
01:01:33,962 --> 01:01:37,382
Well, Mr. Doe, before
we got through I found out

1262
01:01:37,467 --> 01:01:39,845
Smithers is a swell egg,
only he's pretty deaf

1263
01:01:39,928 --> 01:01:41,639
and that accounts for all the noises.

1264
01:01:41,723 --> 01:01:44,809
He says it's a shame how
little we know about our neighbors,

1265
01:01:44,894 --> 01:01:46,855
and then he got an idea and he said,

1266
01:01:46,938 --> 01:01:49,482
"How's about inviting
everybody some place where we can all

1267
01:01:49,566 --> 01:01:52,320
get together and know
each other a little better?"

1268
01:01:53,029 --> 01:01:54,531
Well, I'm feeling so good by this time,

1269
01:01:54,614 --> 01:01:56,534
I'm ripe for anything,
so Smithers goes around

1270
01:01:56,617 --> 01:01:58,620
the neighborhood
inviting everybody to a meeting

1271
01:01:58,703 --> 01:02:00,956
at the schoolhouse and
I tell everybody that comes

1272
01:02:01,041 --> 01:02:04,504
into the store, including
Mr. Schwabecker, my boss.

1273
01:02:04,962 --> 01:02:06,129
Oh, I'm talking too much.

1274
01:02:09,968 --> 01:02:13,723
Well, I'll be doggone if
40 people don't show up.

1275
01:02:13,808 --> 01:02:15,977
Course, none of us knew
what to do, but we sure got a kick

1276
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:18,189
out of seeing how glad everybody was

1277
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:20,232
just to say hello to one another.

1278
01:02:20,732 --> 01:02:22,653
Tell him about making
Sourpuss chairman, honey.

1279
01:02:22,735 --> 01:02:24,864
Oh yeah, we made
Sourpuss chairman and decided

1280
01:02:24,948 --> 01:02:27,034
to call ourselves the John Doe Club.

1281
01:02:27,117 --> 01:02:29,036
And say, incidentally, this is my wife.

1282
01:02:29,119 --> 01:02:30,037
Come here, honey.

1283
01:02:30,664 --> 01:02:32,250
This is my wife, Mr. Doe.

1284
01:02:32,333 --> 01:02:33,626
How do you do, Mr. Doe?

1285
01:02:34,252 --> 01:02:36,338
Sourpuss is here, too.

1286
01:02:36,421 --> 01:02:37,296
Oh, is he?

1287
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:43,012
This is Sourpuss, or
excuse me, Mr. Smithers, Mr. Doe.

1288
01:02:43,097 --> 01:02:43,848
That's all right.

1289
01:02:43,931 --> 01:02:45,725
If you didn't call me Sourpuss,
it wouldn't feel natural.

1290
01:02:47,979 --> 01:02:51,024
Well, anyway, I guess nearly
everybody in the neighborhood

1291
01:02:51,107 --> 01:02:52,360
came except the Delaney's,

1292
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:56,115
and the Delaney's live in a big house
with an iron fence around it

1293
01:02:56,198 --> 01:02:58,409
and they always keep their blinds drawn,

1294
01:02:58,492 --> 01:03:00,872
and we always figured
that he was just an old miser

1295
01:03:00,955 --> 01:03:02,540
that sat back counting his money,

1296
01:03:02,622 --> 01:03:05,460
so why bother about inviting him,

1297
01:03:05,543 --> 01:03:09,466
until Grimes, the milkman,
spoke up, and he said,

1298
01:03:09,549 --> 01:03:11,844
"Say, you've got the Delaney's all wrong,"

1299
01:03:12,262 --> 01:03:15,348
and then he tells us about
how they canceled their milk last week,

1300
01:03:15,433 --> 01:03:17,018
and how when
he found a note on the bottle,

1301
01:03:17,100 --> 01:03:20,772
he got kinda curious-like
and he sort of peeked in under the blinds

1302
01:03:20,857 --> 01:03:22,774
and found the house was empty.

1303
01:03:22,859 --> 01:03:25,279
"If you ask me,"
he says, "they're starving."

1304
01:03:25,362 --> 01:03:27,531
Old man Delaney has
been bringing his furniture

1305
01:03:27,616 --> 01:03:31,369
over to my place at night,
one piece at a time, and selling it.

1306
01:03:31,786 --> 01:03:34,541
Yeah. And well sir,
a half a dozen of us ran over there

1307
01:03:34,624 --> 01:03:36,752
to fetch him and
we brought him to the meeting,

1308
01:03:37,085 --> 01:03:38,588
and what a reception they got.

1309
01:03:38,671 --> 01:03:40,256
Well, everybody shook hands with him

1310
01:03:40,340 --> 01:03:42,886
and made a fuss over them,
and well, finally,

1311
01:03:42,969 --> 01:03:45,722
Mr. and Mrs. Delaney
just sat right down and cried.

1312
01:03:45,806 --> 01:03:48,060
And then we started to find out
about a lot of other people.

1313
01:03:48,143 --> 01:03:50,021
Yeah sure.
Well, you know Grubbel, for instance.

1314
01:03:50,103 --> 01:03:52,149
Grubbel's here, see?

1315
01:03:52,232 --> 01:03:53,441
Yeah, that's him.

1316
01:03:54,484 --> 01:03:56,070
Of course, you don't know Grubbel,

1317
01:03:56,154 --> 01:04:00,369
but he's the man everybody figured
was the worst no-account

1318
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:03,914
in the neighborhood
because he was living like a hermit,

1319
01:04:03,997 --> 01:04:06,125
and nobody would
have anything to do with him,

1320
01:04:06,210 --> 01:04:09,046
that is, until Murphy,
the postman, told us the truth.

1321
01:04:09,588 --> 01:04:12,801
Why, Grubbel, he says,
he lives out of garbage cans

1322
01:04:12,884 --> 01:04:14,303
because he won't take charity,

1323
01:04:14,386 --> 01:04:16,847
'cause it'd ruin his self-respect,
he says.

1324
01:04:17,264 --> 01:04:19,227
Just like you said on the radio, Mr. Doe.

1325
01:04:19,310 --> 01:04:21,563
Well, sir, about
a dozen families got together

1326
01:04:21,646 --> 01:04:23,608
and gave Grubbel
a job watering their lawns,

1327
01:04:23,691 --> 01:04:24,901
isn't that wonderful?

1328
01:04:24,984 --> 01:04:27,154
And then we found
jobs for six other people

1329
01:04:27,237 --> 01:04:28,990
and they've all gone off relief.

1330
01:04:29,073 --> 01:04:32,828
And my boss, Mr. Schwabecker, made a job
in his warehouse for old man Delaney.

1331
01:04:32,911 --> 01:04:34,414
And he gave you that five-dollar raise.

1332
01:04:34,497 --> 01:04:37,252
Yeah, wasn't that swell?

1333
01:04:38,502 --> 01:04:40,840
Why, Bert, I feel slighted.

1334
01:04:40,923 --> 01:04:43,843
I'd like to join, but nobody asked me.

1335
01:04:43,926 --> 01:04:48,016
I'm sorry, Mayor, but we voted that
no politician could join.

1336
01:04:48,099 --> 01:04:49,935
Just the John Does of the neighborhood,

1337
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,938
'cause you know how politicians are.

1338
01:04:53,523 --> 01:04:54,358
Yeah.

1339
01:04:56,235 --> 01:04:59,698
Well, the reason
we wanted to tell you this, Mr. Doe,

1340
01:04:59,781 --> 01:05:03,036
was just to give you
an idea of what you started,

1341
01:05:03,578 --> 01:05:06,583
and from where I'm sitting,
I don't see any sense

1342
01:05:06,666 --> 01:05:08,209
in you jumping off any building.

1343
01:05:08,502 --> 01:05:10,421
No!

1344
01:05:10,712 --> 01:05:12,590
Well, thank you for listening.

1345
01:05:13,967 --> 01:05:15,386
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

1346
01:05:16,470 --> 01:05:17,973
You're a wonderful man,

1347
01:05:18,056 --> 01:05:21,644
and it strikes me you can be mighty
useful walking around for a while.

1348
01:05:22,644 --> 01:05:23,898
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

1349
01:05:31,992 --> 01:05:34,370
I'm Mrs. Delaney, Mr. Doe.

1350
01:05:34,662 --> 01:05:36,830
God bless you, my boy.

1351
01:06:10,793 --> 01:06:13,214
Gee whiz, I'm all mixed up.

1352
01:06:16,634 --> 01:06:17,887
I don't get it.

1353
01:06:19,097 --> 01:06:20,641
Look, all those swell people think

1354
01:06:20,723 --> 01:06:22,561
I'm gonna jump off
a building or something.

1355
01:06:22,644 --> 01:06:24,521
I never had any such idea.

1356
01:06:27,232 --> 01:06:30,653
Gosh, a fella would have to
be a mighty fine example himself

1357
01:06:30,737 --> 01:06:32,740
to go around telling other people
how to...

1358
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:36,078
Say, look, what happened the other night
was on account of Miss Mitchell here.

1359
01:06:36,161 --> 01:06:37,372
She wrote the stuff.

1360
01:06:37,830 --> 01:06:39,916
Don't you see what
a wonderful thing this can be?

1361
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,418
But we need you, John.

1362
01:06:41,502 --> 01:06:42,253
You're hooked.

1363
01:06:42,336 --> 01:06:44,381
I can see that right now, they got you.

1364
01:06:44,464 --> 01:06:45,549
Well, I'm through.

1365
01:06:48,429 --> 01:06:51,433
For three years I been trying to get you
up to the Columbia River country.

1366
01:06:51,516 --> 01:06:53,435
First it was your glass arm,
then it was the radio,

1367
01:06:53,518 --> 01:06:55,313
and now it's the John Doe Clubs.

1368
01:06:55,396 --> 01:06:56,607
Well, I ain't waiting another minute.

1369
01:07:00,235 --> 01:07:02,030
Gangway, you heelots!

1370
01:07:03,823 --> 01:07:04,950
Hey Colonel, wait a minute.

1371
01:07:05,034 --> 01:07:07,244
Hey, Colonel!

1372
01:07:07,704 --> 01:07:09,707
I want you personally
to go along with John Doe

1373
01:07:09,789 --> 01:07:11,752
and Miss Mitchell and
handle the press and the radio.

1374
01:07:11,834 --> 01:07:12,585
- Me?
- Yes.

1375
01:07:12,669 --> 01:07:14,046
I don't want to take
any chances, and Johnson?

1376
01:07:14,130 --> 01:07:14,880
Yes, D.B.?

1377
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,634
Your crew will do the mop up job.

1378
01:07:16,716 --> 01:07:17,885
They'll follow John Doe into every town,

1379
01:07:17,968 --> 01:07:20,596
see that the clubs are properly organized
and the charters issued.

1380
01:07:20,680 --> 01:07:21,431
Right.

1381
01:07:21,514 --> 01:07:22,642
There are only eight flags up there now.

1382
01:07:22,725 --> 01:07:25,228
I want to see that map
covered before we get through.

1383
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:33,446
This has been growing like wildfire.

1384
01:08:33,528 --> 01:08:35,531
If they made demands, I'd understand it,

1385
01:08:35,613 --> 01:08:37,743
but the John Does ask for nothing.

1386
01:08:38,159 --> 01:08:39,369
People are going off relief.

1387
01:08:39,661 --> 01:08:41,164
If this keeps up, I'll be out of a job.

1388
01:08:41,455 --> 01:08:43,959
Soon as he gets strong enough,
we'll find out what John Doe wants.

1389
01:08:44,043 --> 01:08:48,006
30 every Thursday,
60 at 60, who knows what?

1390
01:08:48,298 --> 01:08:50,343
I'm sorry, boss, they just won't let
anybody talk politics with him.

1391
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:51,511
It's crazy.

1392
01:08:52,346 --> 01:08:53,513
We've got to get to him.

1393
01:08:53,848 --> 01:08:55,893
They represent millions of voters.

1394
01:09:04,820 --> 01:09:05,905
[0.3.1 I tell you, ladies and gentlemen,

1395
01:09:05,989 --> 01:09:07,784
this thing has been
nothing short of a prairie fire.

1396
01:09:08,116 --> 01:09:09,911
We've received so
many applications for charters

1397
01:09:09,994 --> 01:09:12,706
to the John Doe clubs,
we haven't been able to take care of them.

1398
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,333
I'd hate to have
that many pins stuck in me.

1399
01:09:15,627 --> 01:09:17,213
This John Doe
convention is a natural.

1400
01:09:17,296 --> 01:09:18,673
It's going to put our city on the map.

1401
01:09:19,174 --> 01:09:21,928
Why, over 2,400 John Doe Clubs
are sending delegates.

1402
01:09:22,010 --> 01:09:23,137
Can you imagine that?

1403
01:09:23,220 --> 01:09:25,015
You, Mr. Mayor, will be the official host.

1404
01:09:25,099 --> 01:09:26,558
You will make
the arrangements for decorating the city,

1405
01:09:26,641 --> 01:09:28,602
parades, and a reception
for John Doe when he gets home,

1406
01:09:29,020 --> 01:09:30,522
and don't wear your high hat.

1407
01:09:30,606 --> 01:09:31,481
No high hat?

1408
01:09:31,731 --> 01:09:33,360
No high hat, and from you, Connell,

1409
01:09:33,777 --> 01:09:35,403
I want a special
John Doe edition every day

1410
01:09:35,487 --> 01:09:36,823
until the convention is over,

1411
01:09:37,239 --> 01:09:39,118
and now, if you will please,
step into the outer office

1412
01:09:39,201 --> 01:09:40,953
and look your prettiest because there are

1413
01:09:41,036 --> 01:09:43,330
photographers there to
take pictures of this committee.

1414
01:09:43,414 --> 01:09:45,084
Don't worry, D.B.
Everything'll be taken care of.

1415
01:09:45,166 --> 01:09:47,336
- Sure.
- Isn't it all too wonderful?

1416
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:51,967
Mr. Mayor, would you
step down in front, please?

1417
01:09:52,051 --> 01:09:53,762
You ladies get close to him. That's it.

1418
01:09:53,846 --> 01:09:55,431
- Well, I don't get it.
- Get what?

1419
01:09:56,015 --> 01:09:58,561
Look, D.B., I'm supposed to
know my way around.

1420
01:09:58,643 --> 01:10:00,646
This John Doe movement's
cost you a fortune.

1421
01:10:00,938 --> 01:10:02,732
Now, this convention is gonna cost plenty.

1422
01:10:03,150 --> 01:10:03,900
Well?

1423
01:10:04,359 --> 01:10:08,030
Well, I'm stuck with two and two and
I'm a sucker if I can make four out of it.

1424
01:10:08,407 --> 01:10:09,533
Where do you come in?

1425
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:15,709
I have the satisfaction
of knowing that my money

1426
01:10:15,792 --> 01:10:17,627
has been spent for a worthy cause.

1427
01:10:18,378 --> 01:10:20,715
I see.
I better stick to running the paper, huh?

1428
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:22,843
I think maybe you better had.

1429
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:30,854
Connell, I'd like to
have the John Doe contract,

1430
01:10:30,937 --> 01:10:32,648
all the receipts for the money
we advanced for the letter

1431
01:10:32,731 --> 01:10:35,736
Miss Mitchell wrote
for which I gave her 1,000 dollars.

1432
01:10:36,778 --> 01:10:38,364
Yes, sure.

1433
01:10:39,574 --> 01:10:41,952
Well, we leave for
the airport in half an hour.

1434
01:10:42,036 --> 01:10:43,162
Is that Johnny boy's room?

1435
01:10:43,245 --> 01:10:44,038
Better hustle him up.

1436
01:10:44,122 --> 01:10:46,208
- He'll be ready on time. He's packing.
- Oh, good.

1437
01:10:46,291 --> 01:10:47,959
Did you see his picture
on the cover of <i>Time?</i>

1438
01:10:48,044 --> 01:10:49,128
Yeah.

1439
01:10:49,212 --> 01:10:50,422
I gotta give you credit, Annie, girl.

1440
01:10:50,505 --> 01:10:53,218
I've handled a good many
big promotions in my time,

1441
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,721
everything from
the World's Fair to a channel swimmer,

1442
01:10:55,804 --> 01:10:58,141
but this one has
certainly got me spinning,

1443
01:10:58,934 --> 01:11:02,104
and now, a John Doe convention, wow.

1444
01:11:03,064 --> 01:11:07,862
Say, if you could only get him to jump off
the City Hall roof on Christmas Eve,

1445
01:11:07,946 --> 01:11:09,989
I'd guarantee you
half a million people there.

1446
01:11:10,074 --> 01:11:11,492
- Charlie?
- Hmm?

1447
01:11:11,574 --> 01:11:12,953
What do you make of him?

1448
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,913
Who, Johnny boy?

1449
01:11:15,498 --> 01:11:19,711
Well, I don't know what angle you want
but I'll give it to you quick.

1450
01:11:19,795 --> 01:11:21,756
Number one, he's got great yokel appeal,

1451
01:11:21,839 --> 01:11:23,049
but he's a nice guy.

1452
01:11:23,132 --> 01:11:25,219
Number two, he's beginning
to believe he really wrote

1453
01:11:25,302 --> 01:11:27,556
that original suicide
letter that you made up.

1454
01:11:27,888 --> 01:11:31,227
Number three, he thinks that
you're Joan of Arc or something.

1455
01:11:31,309 --> 01:11:32,103
Yeah, I know.

1456
01:11:32,186 --> 01:11:35,650
Number four, well,
you know what number four is.

1457
01:11:35,984 --> 01:11:37,025
He's nuts about you.

1458
01:11:37,110 --> 01:11:39,071
It's runnin' out of his ears.

1459
01:11:39,154 --> 01:11:40,364
You left out number five.

1460
01:11:40,446 --> 01:11:42,409
We're all heels, me especially.

1461
01:11:43,076 --> 01:11:44,495
Holy smoke.

1462
01:11:45,204 --> 01:11:46,037
Come in.

1463
01:11:52,298 --> 01:11:53,048
I'm all packed.

1464
01:11:53,132 --> 01:11:54,883
Good, I'll go and get Beany boy.

1465
01:11:56,052 --> 01:11:57,220
Okay, Charlie boy.

1466
01:12:11,448 --> 01:12:13,034
Can I help you pack?

1467
01:12:13,451 --> 01:12:14,784
No, thank you.

1468
01:12:24,090 --> 01:12:26,051
You care if I sit down, out here?

1469
01:12:26,134 --> 01:12:27,052
No.

1470
01:12:36,148 --> 01:12:40,988
You know, I had a crazy dream last night.

1471
01:12:43,825 --> 01:12:44,868
It was about you.

1472
01:12:46,119 --> 01:12:47,080
About me?

1473
01:12:47,705 --> 01:12:49,792
Yeah, sure was crazy.

1474
01:12:49,875 --> 01:12:51,585
I dreamt I was your father.

1475
01:12:55,549 --> 01:13:00,179
There was something
I was trying to stop you from doing.

1476
01:13:00,890 --> 01:13:04,186
So, I got up out of bed

1477
01:13:04,770 --> 01:13:08,149
and I walked right through the wall here,
right straight into your room.

1478
01:13:08,483 --> 01:13:10,111
You know how dreams are.

1479
01:13:10,986 --> 01:13:14,199
And there you were in bed,
but you were a little girl,

1480
01:13:14,282 --> 01:13:17,913
you know, about 10, and very pretty, too.

1481
01:13:19,498 --> 01:13:23,629
So I shook you, and
the moment you opened your eyes,

1482
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:26,049
you hopped out of bed and
started running like the devil.

1483
01:13:26,133 --> 01:13:27,926
In your nightgown,
you ran right out the window there,

1484
01:13:28,009 --> 01:13:29,637
and you ran out over the tops of buildings

1485
01:13:29,721 --> 01:13:32,975
and roofs and everything
for miles and I was chasing you,

1486
01:13:34,435 --> 01:13:36,563
and all the time you were running,

1487
01:13:37,105 --> 01:13:39,567
you kept growing
bigger and bigger and bigger, and

1488
01:13:39,650 --> 01:13:42,529
pretty soon you were
as big as you are now, you know,

1489
01:13:42,612 --> 01:13:47,244
grown up, and all
the time I kept asking myself,

1490
01:13:47,326 --> 01:13:48,871
"What am I chasing her for?"

1491
01:13:49,998 --> 01:13:51,499
And I didn't know.

1492
01:13:51,959 --> 01:13:54,127
Isn't that a hot one?

1493
01:13:55,881 --> 01:13:58,301
Well, anyway, you ran into some place

1494
01:13:58,383 --> 01:14:01,429
and then I ran in after you
and when I got there,

1495
01:14:01,929 --> 01:14:04,601
there you were, getting married,

1496
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:11,527
and the nightgown had changed
into a beautiful wedding gown.

1497
01:14:12,986 --> 01:14:14,782
You sure looked pretty, too,

1498
01:14:16,282 --> 01:14:19,203
and then I knew what it was I was
trying to stop you from doing.

1499
01:14:20,623 --> 01:14:22,041
Dreams are sure crazy, aren't they?

1500
01:14:23,084 --> 01:14:23,919
Well,

1501
01:14:25,838 --> 01:14:27,507
would you like to know
who it was you were marrying?

1502
01:14:28,841 --> 01:14:32,680
Oh, a tall handsome Ubangi, I suppose.

1503
01:14:33,431 --> 01:14:34,557
No, not that bad.

1504
01:14:34,642 --> 01:14:36,977
It was the fella
that sends you flowers every day.

1505
01:14:37,229 --> 01:14:39,731
What's his name, Mr. Norton's nephew?

1506
01:14:41,108 --> 01:14:42,026
Ted Sheldon.

1507
01:14:42,108 --> 01:14:43,194
Yeah, that's the one.

1508
01:14:44,488 --> 01:14:46,157
But here's the funniest part of it all.

1509
01:14:47,033 --> 01:14:49,328
I was the fella up there
doing the marrying, you know,

1510
01:14:49,410 --> 01:14:51,080
the Justice of the Peace or something.

1511
01:14:51,163 --> 01:14:52,165
You were?

1512
01:14:52,249 --> 01:14:53,583
I thought you were chasing me.

1513
01:14:53,667 --> 01:14:56,838
Well, yes I was,
but I was your father then, you see,

1514
01:14:57,547 --> 01:15:00,593
but the real me, John Doe, that is,

1515
01:15:00,677 --> 01:15:04,098
Long John Willoughby,
I was the fella up there with a book.

1516
01:15:04,973 --> 01:15:05,892
You know what I mean?

1517
01:15:05,976 --> 01:15:06,977
I guess so.

1518
01:15:07,309 --> 01:15:08,312
Then what happened?

1519
01:15:08,855 --> 01:15:11,358
Well, I took you across my knee

1520
01:15:11,441 --> 01:15:12,943
and I started spankin' ya.

1521
01:15:13,485 --> 01:15:14,946
That is, I didn't do it.

1522
01:15:15,029 --> 01:15:17,241
I mean, I did do it, but it wasn't me.

1523
01:15:17,324 --> 01:15:18,742
See, I was your father then.

1524
01:15:19,952 --> 01:15:22,498
Well, I had you across my knee and I said,

1525
01:15:22,582 --> 01:15:26,044
"Annie, I won't allow you to marry a man

1526
01:15:26,128 --> 01:15:28,339
that's... that's just rich

1527
01:15:28,923 --> 01:15:31,719
or that has his secretary
send you flowers.

1528
01:15:32,219 --> 01:15:35,181
The man you marry
has got to swim rivers for you.

1529
01:15:35,265 --> 01:15:37,601
He's got to climb high mountains for you.

1530
01:15:37,685 --> 01:15:39,228
He's got to slay dragons for you.

1531
01:15:39,311 --> 01:15:42,692
He's got to perform
wonderful deeds for you!"

1532
01:15:42,775 --> 01:15:45,111
Yes, sir, and all the time,
the guy up there,

1533
01:15:45,194 --> 01:15:47,531
you know, with the book,
me, just stood there

1534
01:15:47,615 --> 01:15:49,909
noddin' his head and he said,

1535
01:15:49,993 --> 01:15:51,954
"Go to it, Pop, whack her one for me,

1536
01:15:52,038 --> 01:15:54,082
because that's just
the way I feel about it too."

1537
01:15:54,875 --> 01:15:56,209
So he says,

1538
01:15:56,293 --> 01:15:58,046
"Come on down here
and whack her yourself."

1539
01:15:58,129 --> 01:16:01,133
So I came down
and I whacked you a good one.

1540
01:16:01,216 --> 01:16:03,802
See, then he whacked you,
and I whacked you another one.

1541
01:16:03,887 --> 01:16:05,681
We both started whacking you like...

1542
01:16:07,433 --> 01:16:09,853
Well, if you're through whacking her,
come on, let's get going.

1543
01:16:09,937 --> 01:16:11,356
Okay, fellas, right in here.

1544
01:16:11,939 --> 01:16:12,982
You go out the side entrance.

1545
01:16:13,066 --> 01:16:14,485
There's a bunch of
autograph seekers out front.

1546
01:16:15,277 --> 01:16:17,072
We'll be down with the bags in a minute.

1547
01:16:19,157 --> 01:16:21,953
Come on, don't make
a government project out of this.

1548
01:16:25,123 --> 01:16:26,376
Hi, Beany.

1549
01:16:26,459 --> 01:16:28,212
When's our plane take off again?

1550
01:16:28,295 --> 01:16:29,088
Couple of minutes.

1551
01:16:30,338 --> 01:16:32,424
How many people do
you think we've talked to already,

1552
01:16:32,509 --> 01:16:34,470
outside the radio, I mean?

1553
01:16:34,553 --> 01:16:37,140
Oh, I don't know, about 300,000.

1554
01:16:37,765 --> 01:16:39,226
300,000.

1555
01:16:40,478 --> 01:16:41,980
What makes them do it, Ann?

1556
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:48,113
What makes them come and listen and get up
their John Doe Clubs the way they do?

1557
01:16:49,782 --> 01:16:51,076
I've been trying to figure it out.

1558
01:16:51,159 --> 01:16:54,122
Look, John, what we're handing them
are platitudes,

1559
01:16:54,204 --> 01:16:55,873
things they've heard a million times.

1560
01:16:55,957 --> 01:16:57,960
Love thy neighbor,
clouds have silver linings,

1561
01:16:58,043 --> 01:16:59,003
turn the other cheek, it's just--

1562
01:16:59,086 --> 01:17:00,714
Oh yeah, I heard 'em a million times too,

1563
01:17:00,797 --> 01:17:04,093
but... there you are.

1564
01:17:05,137 --> 01:17:08,224
Maybe they're like me,
just beginning to get an idea

1565
01:17:08,307 --> 01:17:09,684
what those things mean.

1566
01:17:10,643 --> 01:17:12,603
I never thought much about people before.

1567
01:17:12,688 --> 01:17:14,983
They were always just
somebody to fill up the bleachers.

1568
01:17:16,067 --> 01:17:20,532
The only time I worried about them was
when they didn't come in to see me pitch.

1569
01:17:22,243 --> 01:17:26,290
You know, lately I've been watching them
when I talk to them.

1570
01:17:27,331 --> 01:17:29,669
I can see something in their faces.

1571
01:17:30,671 --> 01:17:35,552
I could feel that
they were hungry for something,

1572
01:17:37,179 --> 01:17:38,181
you know what I mean?

1573
01:17:38,681 --> 01:17:39,683
Maybe that's why they came.

1574
01:17:39,767 --> 01:17:42,645
Maybe they're just lonely and

1575
01:17:43,395 --> 01:17:45,316
wanted somebody to say hello to.

1576
01:17:46,859 --> 01:17:48,152
I know how they feel.

1577
01:17:49,112 --> 01:17:53,076
I've been lonely and hungry for something
practically all my life.

1578
01:17:59,459 --> 01:18:00,878
All aboard, folks.

1579
01:18:01,797 --> 01:18:03,173
We'll have the city behind us.

1580
01:18:03,255 --> 01:18:04,884
Yeah, that's true.

1581
01:18:04,966 --> 01:18:06,219
Oh, somebody else sitting here?

1582
01:18:06,302 --> 01:18:07,888
No, no, no, that's your seat.

1583
01:18:08,514 --> 01:18:10,225
And this is your coat.

1584
01:18:10,307 --> 01:18:11,059
Mine?

1585
01:18:11,142 --> 01:18:13,062
A little token of appreciation.

1586
01:18:13,978 --> 01:18:15,314
Oh!

1587
01:18:17,150 --> 01:18:19,569
Oh, it's beautiful, D.B.

1588
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,366
I don't quite know what to say.

1589
01:18:22,449 --> 01:18:23,199
Oh, don't say anything at all.

1590
01:18:23,283 --> 01:18:24,452
Just sit down.

1591
01:18:25,285 --> 01:18:26,370
Oh!

1592
01:18:28,999 --> 01:18:31,002
Go ahead, open it, open it.

1593
01:18:34,006 --> 01:18:39,973
Oh. Oh, it's lovely.

1594
01:18:40,306 --> 01:18:41,599
And a new contract goes with it.

1595
01:18:45,980 --> 01:18:48,650
Well, come on, spring it.

1596
01:18:48,734 --> 01:18:50,195
You've got something on your mind.

1597
01:18:50,736 --> 01:18:52,656
Must be stupendous.

1598
01:18:53,532 --> 01:18:54,992
That's what I like about her.

1599
01:18:55,076 --> 01:18:56,662
Right to the point, like that.

1600
01:18:59,457 --> 01:19:01,961
All right, practical Annie, here it is.

1601
01:19:02,044 --> 01:19:05,007
Tomorrow night,
before a crowd of 15,000 people

1602
01:19:05,089 --> 01:19:07,260
and talking over a nationwide
radio hook-up,

1603
01:19:07,802 --> 01:19:09,804
John Doe will...

1604
01:19:09,889 --> 01:19:11,515
Announce the formation of a third party.

1605
01:19:11,891 --> 01:19:13,018
A third party?

1606
01:19:13,101 --> 01:19:15,353
Yes, the John Doe Party,

1607
01:19:15,855 --> 01:19:20,235
devoted entirely to the interests
of all the John Does all over the country,

1608
01:19:20,693 --> 01:19:22,071
which practically means...

1609
01:19:23,781 --> 01:19:25,326
90 percent of the voters.

1610
01:19:25,784 --> 01:19:30,540
He will also announce the third party's
candidate for the presidency,

1611
01:19:31,792 --> 01:19:34,504
a man whom he personally recommends,

1612
01:19:34,588 --> 01:19:38,051
a great humanitarian,
the best friend the John Does have.

1613
01:19:39,929 --> 01:19:41,306
Mr. D.B. Norton.

1614
01:19:41,640 --> 01:19:42,473
Yes.

1615
01:19:48,982 --> 01:19:50,109
Wow.

1616
01:19:50,193 --> 01:19:55,533
♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪

1617
01:19:55,616 --> 01:19:59,914
♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪

1618
01:19:59,997 --> 01:20:03,962
♪ Glory, glory hallelujah ♪

1619
01:20:04,045 --> 01:20:08,092
♪ His truth is marching on ♪

1620
01:20:15,726 --> 01:20:17,980
And although the opening of
the convention is hours off,

1621
01:20:18,063 --> 01:20:19,941
the delegates are already
pouring into the ball park

1622
01:20:20,024 --> 01:20:22,820
by the droves with lunch baskets,
banners, and petitions

1623
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,698
asking John Doe not to jump off any roof.

1624
01:20:25,782 --> 01:20:28,577
No matter how you look at it,
it's still a phenomenal movement.

1625
01:20:28,661 --> 01:20:30,956
These John Does or the hoi polloi,

1626
01:20:31,039 --> 01:20:34,377
as you've heard people call them,
have been laughed at and ridiculed,

1627
01:20:34,460 --> 01:20:36,547
but here they are, gay and happy,

1628
01:20:36,630 --> 01:20:40,510
having traveled thousands of miles,
their expenses paid by their neighbors

1629
01:20:40,886 --> 01:20:44,558
to come here to pay homage
to their hero, John Doe.

1630
01:20:44,975 --> 01:20:46,853
And in these days of wars and bombings,

1631
01:20:46,936 --> 01:20:49,398
it's a hopeful sign
that a simple idea like this

1632
01:20:49,481 --> 01:20:52,652
can sweep the country,
an idea based on friendliness,

1633
01:20:52,736 --> 01:20:55,740
on giving and not taking,
on helping your neighbor

1634
01:20:55,823 --> 01:20:59,161
and asking nothing in return,
and if a thing like this can happen,

1635
01:20:59,244 --> 01:21:04,084
don't let any of your grumbling friends
tell you that humanity is falling apart.

1636
01:21:04,167 --> 01:21:05,586
This is John B. Hughes,

1637
01:21:05,877 --> 01:21:09,508
signing off now and returning you
to our main studio until nine o'clock,

1638
01:21:09,592 --> 01:21:11,135
when the convention will officially open.

1639
01:21:13,472 --> 01:21:15,058
Oh John, come in.

1640
01:21:16,017 --> 01:21:17,352
Say, I'm kinda...

1641
01:21:17,936 --> 01:21:19,480
It's raining out a little.

1642
01:21:19,563 --> 01:21:21,816
That's all right.
It's good to see you.

1643
01:21:21,900 --> 01:21:22,776
Sit down.

1644
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:24,487
Thanks.

1645
01:21:39,673 --> 01:21:40,591
It's for Ann.

1646
01:21:40,884 --> 01:21:42,301
Oh, how nice.

1647
01:21:42,386 --> 01:21:44,346
- Thank you very much.
- Flowers.

1648
01:21:45,973 --> 01:21:47,517
I'm terribly sorry she isn't here.

1649
01:21:48,727 --> 01:21:50,397
- She isn't?
- No, she just left.

1650
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:53,483
I'm surprised you didn't run into her.
She went over to Mr. Norton's house.

1651
01:21:54,318 --> 01:21:55,194
Oh.

1652
01:21:57,154 --> 01:21:59,033
Did you want to see her
about something important?

1653
01:21:59,992 --> 01:22:02,913
Yeah, well, no, it'll wait.

1654
01:22:03,956 --> 01:22:05,291
He's a nice man, isn't he?

1655
01:22:05,375 --> 01:22:06,544
Mr. Norton, I mean.

1656
01:22:07,002 --> 01:22:09,464
He's done an awful lot for the...

1657
01:22:14,721 --> 01:22:18,518
Well, say, my coat's pretty wet.

1658
01:22:19,602 --> 01:22:21,439
Afraid I might have
wet the couch a little.

1659
01:22:27,613 --> 01:22:29,616
Well, I guess I'll see her
at the convention later.

1660
01:22:29,700 --> 01:22:31,911
Yes, of course.
I'll see that she gets the flowers.

1661
01:22:32,954 --> 01:22:34,122
Thanks.

1662
01:22:34,205 --> 01:22:35,123
Good night, Mrs. Mitchell.

1663
01:22:35,207 --> 01:22:36,333
Good night, John.

1664
01:22:42,799 --> 01:22:48,391
Say, Mrs. Mitchell,
I... I'm kind of glad Ann isn't here.

1665
01:22:49,727 --> 01:22:53,647
You see, I came over here
hoping to see her alone

1666
01:22:53,732 --> 01:22:56,777
and kind of hoping I wouldn't,
too, you know what I mean?

1667
01:22:58,322 --> 01:23:00,867
There was something
I wanted to talk to her about.

1668
01:23:03,787 --> 01:23:05,874
Well, it can wait, I guess.

1669
01:23:07,250 --> 01:23:08,210
Good night.

1670
01:23:08,293 --> 01:23:09,545
Good night, John.

1671
01:23:13,175 --> 01:23:15,512
Hey, look, Mrs. Mitchell,
have you ever been married?

1672
01:23:16,512 --> 01:23:17,765
Well, sure you have.

1673
01:23:17,848 --> 01:23:20,018
Gosh, that's pretty silly.

1674
01:23:21,686 --> 01:23:23,606
Well, I guess
you must think I'm kinda batty.

1675
01:23:25,233 --> 01:23:27,569
Well, I guess I'd better be going at that.

1676
01:23:30,031 --> 01:23:33,661
John, my husband said,

1677
01:23:33,744 --> 01:23:35,956
"I love you. Will you marry me?"

1678
01:23:36,790 --> 01:23:37,625
He did?

1679
01:23:38,708 --> 01:23:39,710
What happened?

1680
01:23:40,003 --> 01:23:41,046
I married him.

1681
01:23:42,713 --> 01:23:44,759
Yeah, that's what I mean, see?

1682
01:23:45,009 --> 01:23:46,135
It was easy as all that, huh?

1683
01:23:46,220 --> 01:23:47,095
Uh-huh.

1684
01:23:48,264 --> 01:23:50,058
Yeah, but look, Mrs. Mitchell,

1685
01:23:51,268 --> 01:23:53,061
you know, I love Ann,

1686
01:23:53,145 --> 01:23:55,649
and it's gonna be awfully hard
for me to say it

1687
01:23:55,732 --> 01:23:59,237
'cause, well, you know, she's so wonderful

1688
01:23:59,737 --> 01:24:03,118
and, well, the best I ever was
was a bush league pitcher,

1689
01:24:04,578 --> 01:24:07,164
and you know, I think
she's in love with another man,

1690
01:24:07,582 --> 01:24:11,085
the one she made up,
you know, the real John Doe.

1691
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:14,591
Well, that's pretty tough competition.

1692
01:24:14,675 --> 01:24:16,343
I bet you he'd know
how to say it all right,

1693
01:24:16,927 --> 01:24:20,391
but me, I get up to it
and around it and in back of it,

1694
01:24:20,473 --> 01:24:24,146
but I never get right to it,
you know what I mean?

1695
01:24:24,938 --> 01:24:27,483
So the only chance I've got is, well,

1696
01:24:27,567 --> 01:24:30,279
if somebody could
kinda give her a warning,

1697
01:24:30,362 --> 01:24:33,199
sort of, sort of prepare her
for the shock.

1698
01:24:34,326 --> 01:24:36,203
You mean, you'd like me to do it, hm?

1699
01:24:37,497 --> 01:24:41,711
Well, I was thinking, yeah, you know,
sort of break the ice.

1700
01:24:43,463 --> 01:24:44,840
Of course I will, John.

1701
01:24:46,551 --> 01:24:49,639
Gee whiz, thank you, Mrs. Mitchell.

1702
01:24:51,265 --> 01:24:52,684
Hey, you're okay.

1703
01:25:04,700 --> 01:25:05,868
This John Doe meeting is gonna be

1704
01:25:05,952 --> 01:25:07,578
one of the biggest
things that ever happened.

1705
01:25:07,663 --> 01:25:11,210
Why, they're coming from
all over, trains, boxcars, wagons.

1706
01:25:11,293 --> 01:25:13,212
- Look out!
- Hello, bodyguards.

1707
01:25:13,294 --> 01:25:14,172
Hey, had your dinner yet?

1708
01:25:14,255 --> 01:25:15,005
Not yet.

1709
01:25:15,090 --> 01:25:16,508
- That's all right.
- No, go ahead and have your dinner.

1710
01:25:16,591 --> 01:25:17,843
Wait a minute, John.

1711
01:25:22,767 --> 01:25:23,810
Hello, Mr. Connell.

1712
01:25:23,892 --> 01:25:24,936
How are you, John?

1713
01:25:25,396 --> 01:25:27,648
John, I want to
have a little talk with you.

1714
01:25:29,651 --> 01:25:31,444
What's--what's the matter,
are you falling?

1715
01:25:31,529 --> 01:25:32,822
Come here.

1716
01:25:32,904 --> 01:25:34,615
- Hey, boss.
- Oh, quiet, quiet, quiet.

1717
01:25:35,117 --> 01:25:36,869
Say, tell me something,
did you read the speech

1718
01:25:36,953 --> 01:25:38,913
you're going to make tonight?

1719
01:25:38,995 --> 01:25:40,916
No, I never read
the speeches before I make them.

1720
01:25:40,999 --> 01:25:42,502
I get more of a kick out of it that way.

1721
01:25:42,585 --> 01:25:44,921
Uh-huh, that's just
exactly what I thought.

1722
01:25:45,005 --> 01:25:47,550
Beany, go on down to the office,
tell Pop to give you the speech.

1723
01:25:47,632 --> 01:25:48,635
There's a copy on my desk.

1724
01:25:48,718 --> 01:25:50,303
Gee whiz, boss,
you know Mr. Norton told me

1725
01:25:50,387 --> 01:25:52,348
not to leave him, not even for a minute.

1726
01:25:52,432 --> 01:25:53,266
Go on, go on, go on, go on.

1727
01:25:53,349 --> 01:25:55,309
We'll be at Jim's Bar up the street.

1728
01:25:56,604 --> 01:25:58,148
You're a nice guy, John.

1729
01:25:58,732 --> 01:25:59,650
I like you.

1730
01:26:00,818 --> 01:26:01,985
You're gentle.

1731
01:26:02,821 --> 01:26:04,448
I always like gentle people.

1732
01:26:05,575 --> 01:26:09,203
Me, I'm hard, hard and tough.

1733
01:26:10,122 --> 01:26:11,875
I got no use for hard people.

1734
01:26:13,794 --> 01:26:15,588
Gotta be gentle to suit me.

1735
01:26:19,802 --> 01:26:21,720
Like you, for instance.

1736
01:26:28,939 --> 01:26:31,443
Yep, I'm hard,
but you want to know something?

1737
01:26:32,402 --> 01:26:33,696
I've got a weakness.

1738
01:26:34,113 --> 01:26:35,656
You'd never guess that, would you?

1739
01:26:35,740 --> 01:26:36,867
Well, I have.

1740
01:26:37,659 --> 01:26:38,744
Wanna know what it is?

1741
01:26:39,954 --> 01:26:41,748
"The Star-Spangled Banner."

1742
01:26:42,666 --> 01:26:47,672
Screwy, huh? Well, maybe it is,
but play "The Star-Spangled Banner,"

1743
01:26:47,757 --> 01:26:49,050
I'm a sucker for it.

1744
01:26:50,511 --> 01:26:53,765
Always gets me right here,
you know what I mean?

1745
01:26:54,348 --> 01:26:56,143
Yeah, it gets me right back here.

1746
01:26:57,019 --> 01:26:58,437
Oh, back there, huh?

1747
01:26:59,064 --> 01:27:01,524
Well, every man to his own taste.

1748
01:27:04,863 --> 01:27:07,406
You--you weren't old enough--

1749
01:27:07,492 --> 01:27:09,869
You weren't old enough for
the World War, were you, John?

1750
01:27:10,704 --> 01:27:12,247
No, no, of course not.

1751
01:27:12,872 --> 01:27:14,626
No, you must have been just a kid.

1752
01:27:15,918 --> 01:27:16,754
I was.

1753
01:27:18,213 --> 01:27:23,388
I was just ripe, and raring to go.

1754
01:27:24,765 --> 01:27:27,184
Know what my old man did when I joined up?

1755
01:27:27,268 --> 01:27:28,686
He joined up too.

1756
01:27:29,396 --> 01:27:32,275
Got to be a sergeant,
and here's the kick for you.

1757
01:27:32,984 --> 01:27:34,361
We were in the same outfit.

1758
01:27:34,444 --> 01:27:36,488
Funny, huh?

1759
01:27:42,372 --> 01:27:44,039
He was killed, John.

1760
01:27:46,585 --> 01:27:48,005
I saw him get it.

1761
01:27:50,341 --> 01:27:54,430
I was right there and
I saw it with my own eyes.

1762
01:27:59,603 --> 01:28:02,024
Me, I came out without a scratch.

1763
01:28:04,026 --> 01:28:06,446
That is, excepting my ulcers.

1764
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:13,039
I should be drinking milk, you know.

1765
01:28:13,122 --> 01:28:14,457
This stuff is poison.

1766
01:28:15,541 --> 01:28:16,460
Hey, Tubby!

1767
01:28:17,377 --> 01:28:18,337
Yes, Mr. Connell?

1768
01:28:18,420 --> 01:28:20,088
- What do you say, huh?
- All right.

1769
01:28:22,968 --> 01:28:24,929
Yep, I'm a sucker for this country.

1770
01:28:25,679 --> 01:28:27,350
I'm a sucker for
"The Star-Spangled Banner"

1771
01:28:27,433 --> 01:28:29,018
and I'm a sucker for this country.

1772
01:28:29,644 --> 01:28:31,730
I like what we got here.

1773
01:28:32,189 --> 01:28:33,399
I like it!

1774
01:28:34,943 --> 01:28:38,072
A guy can say what
he wants and do what he wants

1775
01:28:38,155 --> 01:28:40,951
without having
a bayonet shoved through his belly,

1776
01:28:41,034 --> 01:28:42,662
and that's all right, isn't it?

1777
01:28:43,037 --> 01:28:43,788
You betcha.

1778
01:28:43,871 --> 01:28:48,086
Yeah, and we don't want anybody
coming around changing that, do we?

1779
01:28:48,669 --> 01:28:50,339
- No, sir.
- No, sir.

1780
01:28:51,340 --> 01:28:54,051
When they do, I get mad.

1781
01:28:54,135 --> 01:29:00,602
I get boiling mad,
and right now, John, I'm sizzling.

1782
01:29:01,603 --> 01:29:05,024
I get mad for a lot of
other guys besides myself.

1783
01:29:06,235 --> 01:29:09,029
I get mad for a guy named Washington,

1784
01:29:09,949 --> 01:29:13,620
and a guy named Jefferson and Lincoln.

1785
01:29:14,745 --> 01:29:16,456
Lighthouses, John.

1786
01:29:17,625 --> 01:29:20,629
Lighthouses in a foggy world.

1787
01:29:22,507 --> 01:29:23,591
You know what I mean?

1788
01:29:24,718 --> 01:29:26,763
- Yeah, you bet.
- Hmm.

1789
01:29:27,264 --> 01:29:28,432
Listen, pal.

1790
01:29:29,349 --> 01:29:32,563
This fifth column stuff
is pretty rotten, isn't it?

1791
01:29:33,230 --> 01:29:34,648
Yeah, it certainly is.

1792
01:29:35,107 --> 01:29:37,444
And you'd feel like
an awful sucker if you found yourself

1793
01:29:37,526 --> 01:29:39,905
marching right
in the middle of it, wouldn't you?

1794
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:44,996
You, 'cause you wouldn't
know it because you're gentle,

1795
01:29:45,328 --> 01:29:46,874
but that's what you're doing.

1796
01:29:47,791 --> 01:29:50,503
You're mixed up with a skunk, my boy,

1797
01:29:51,588 --> 01:29:54,884
a no-good, dangerous skunk.

1798
01:29:57,679 --> 01:29:59,891
Say, you're not talking
about Mr. Norton, are you?

1799
01:30:00,266 --> 01:30:03,187
I'm not talking about
his grandfather's pet poodle.

1800
01:30:07,358 --> 01:30:09,070
You must be wrong, Mr. Connell,

1801
01:30:09,153 --> 01:30:11,406
'cause he's been marvelous
about the John Doe Clubs.

1802
01:30:11,490 --> 01:30:13,409
Yeah?

1803
01:30:13,868 --> 01:30:17,122
Say, you're sold on this
John Doe idea, aren't you?

1804
01:30:17,205 --> 01:30:17,956
Sure.

1805
01:30:18,041 --> 01:30:20,251
Sure, I don't blame you, so am I.

1806
01:30:20,335 --> 01:30:22,088
It's a beautiful miracle,

1807
01:30:22,505 --> 01:30:27,220
a miracle that can only happen
right here in the good old USA,

1808
01:30:27,303 --> 01:30:28,888
and I think it's terrific.

1809
01:30:28,971 --> 01:30:30,098
What do you think of that?

1810
01:30:30,516 --> 01:30:35,355
Me, hard-boiled Connell,
and I think it's plenty terrific.

1811
01:30:36,357 --> 01:30:40,070
All right, now suppose
a certain unmentionable worm,

1812
01:30:40,153 --> 01:30:44,159
whose initials are D.B.,
was trying to use that

1813
01:30:44,242 --> 01:30:47,455
to shove his way into the White House,

1814
01:30:47,539 --> 01:30:50,042
so he could put the screws on,

1815
01:30:50,501 --> 01:30:54,172
so he could turn out
the lights in the lighthouses.

1816
01:30:57,678 --> 01:30:59,763
What would you say about that?

1817
01:31:00,556 --> 01:31:02,475
Nobody's gonna do that, Mr. Connell.

1818
01:31:03,225 --> 01:31:05,813
They can't use
the John Doe Clubs for politics.

1819
01:31:05,896 --> 01:31:07,440
That's the main idea.

1820
01:31:07,524 --> 01:31:08,859
Is that so?

1821
01:31:09,193 --> 01:31:12,406
Then what's a big political boss
like Hammett doing in town?

1822
01:31:12,488 --> 01:31:14,658
And a labor leader like Bennett,

1823
01:31:14,742 --> 01:31:17,620
and a lot of other big shots that are
up at D.B.'s house right now.

1824
01:31:17,997 --> 01:31:23,254
Wolves, John, wolves,
waiting to cut up the John Does.

1825
01:31:23,713 --> 01:31:25,965
Wait 'til you get a gander at that speech

1826
01:31:26,048 --> 01:31:27,509
you're gonna make tonight.

1827
01:31:27,593 --> 01:31:28,676
You're all wet.

1828
01:31:28,760 --> 01:31:29,929
Miss Mitchell writes the speeches.

1829
01:31:30,012 --> 01:31:31,973
Nobody can make
her write that kind of stuff.

1830
01:31:32,057 --> 01:31:33,267
They can't, huh?

1831
01:31:33,350 --> 01:31:35,353
Who do you think writes 'em, my aunt Emma?

1832
01:31:36,271 --> 01:31:38,191
What are you talk--I know she writes them

1833
01:31:38,274 --> 01:31:40,735
and gets a big bonus for doing them, too.

1834
01:31:40,819 --> 01:31:43,531
A mink coat and a diamond bracelet.

1835
01:31:43,615 --> 01:31:45,240
Don't write 'em?

1836
01:31:45,325 --> 01:31:47,286
Why, that gold-grabbing
dame would double cross

1837
01:31:47,369 --> 01:31:50,457
her own mother for
a handful of Chinese yen.

1838
01:31:50,540 --> 01:31:51,374
Shut up!

1839
01:31:53,419 --> 01:31:54,755
If you weren't drunk, I'd--

1840
01:31:55,463 --> 01:31:56,548
Hey, boss.

1841
01:31:57,424 --> 01:31:59,219
Here's the speech, boss.

1842
01:31:59,302 --> 01:32:00,596
Hey.

1843
01:32:00,679 --> 01:32:03,850
Go on and read it,
John, and then start sockin'.

1844
01:32:05,895 --> 01:32:07,605
Hey, wait a minute, Mr. Doe.

1845
01:32:09,650 --> 01:32:11,694
- Tubby.
- Yes, sir.

1846
01:32:11,777 --> 01:32:13,571
Better bring me a glass of milk.

1847
01:32:15,241 --> 01:32:16,992
I'm smoking too much.

1848
01:32:21,249 --> 01:32:22,541
Yes, Charlie?

1849
01:32:22,624 --> 01:32:24,002
Got everything all set?

1850
01:32:24,085 --> 01:32:26,464
Fine, John Doe been taken care of?

1851
01:32:26,547 --> 01:32:27,507
Good.

1852
01:32:27,965 --> 01:32:30,970
How many people
you think will be there, 15,000?

1853
01:32:31,053 --> 01:32:32,847
Oh my, that's fine.

1854
01:32:33,306 --> 01:32:34,350
Now listen, Charlie.

1855
01:32:34,433 --> 01:32:36,435
As soon as John Doe
stops talking about me,

1856
01:32:36,519 --> 01:32:39,523
I want you to start that demonstration,
and make it a big one, you understand?

1857
01:32:39,606 --> 01:32:41,609
Don't worry about that, 0.3.
My boys are there.

1858
01:32:41,693 --> 01:32:42,818
They'll take care of it.

1859
01:32:42,903 --> 01:32:43,904
What?

1860
01:32:43,988 --> 01:32:45,656
Yes, I'll be there 15 minutes
after I get your call.

1861
01:32:47,617 --> 01:32:49,120
Why, Mr. Doe!

1862
01:32:49,203 --> 01:32:50,705
Where are they?

1863
01:32:50,788 --> 01:32:52,249
In the dining room, sir.

1864
01:32:57,256 --> 01:33:00,427
Gentlemen, I think we're about ready
to throw that great big bombshell.

1865
01:33:00,510 --> 01:33:02,053
Yeah, well it's about time.

1866
01:33:02,137 --> 01:33:03,806
Even a conservative
estimate shows that we can count

1867
01:33:03,889 --> 01:33:07,853
on anywhere between
10 and 20 million John Doe votes.

1868
01:33:07,936 --> 01:33:11,316
Add to that the labor vote
that Mr. Bennett will throw in,

1869
01:33:11,400 --> 01:33:13,026
and the votes controlled
by Mr. Hammett and

1870
01:33:13,110 --> 01:33:14,779
the rest of you gentlemen
in your own territories,

1871
01:33:14,862 --> 01:33:16,156
and nothing can stop us.

1872
01:33:16,239 --> 01:33:20,578
As I said before, I'm with you, providing
you can guarantee the John Doe vote.

1873
01:33:20,662 --> 01:33:21,872
Don't worry about that.

1874
01:33:21,955 --> 01:33:23,666
You can count on me, on one condition.

1875
01:33:24,375 --> 01:33:26,086
Little Bennett's gotta be taken care of.

1876
01:33:26,169 --> 01:33:28,798
Didn't I tell you that everybody
in this room will be taken care of?

1877
01:33:29,049 --> 01:33:31,009
My agreement with you gentlemen stands.

1878
01:33:31,092 --> 01:33:35,390
I'm with you, D.B., but I still think
it's a very daring thing we're attempting.

1879
01:33:35,474 --> 01:33:37,435
These are daring times, Mr. Barrington.

1880
01:33:37,517 --> 01:33:39,062
We're coming to a new order of things.

1881
01:33:39,730 --> 01:33:40,481
There's too much talk

1882
01:33:40,564 --> 01:33:41,815
- been going on in this country.
- Certainly.

1883
01:33:41,899 --> 01:33:43,233
Too many concessions
have been made.

1884
01:33:43,318 --> 01:33:45,070
What the American
people need is an iron hand.

1885
01:33:45,153 --> 01:33:46,404
- You're right.
- That's true.

1886
01:33:46,489 --> 01:33:47,698
Quite right, D.B.

1887
01:33:47,948 --> 01:33:49,034
Discipline!

1888
01:33:51,204 --> 01:33:54,583
And now may I offer
a little toast to Miss Ann Mitchell,

1889
01:33:55,334 --> 01:33:59,130
the brilliant and beautiful lady
who is responsible for all this.

1890
01:33:59,590 --> 01:34:01,509
Miss Mitchell.

1891
01:34:01,592 --> 01:34:03,595
Mr. Norton, I'd like to
talk to you alone for a minute.

1892
01:34:03,678 --> 01:34:05,681
Oh, Miss Mitchell has
something to say to us.

1893
01:34:12,399 --> 01:34:13,650
Hello.

1894
01:34:21,994 --> 01:34:23,287
John, I'm so glad to see you.

1895
01:34:23,372 --> 01:34:24,540
I was terribly worried.

1896
01:34:24,622 --> 01:34:26,042
Did you write this?

1897
01:34:26,918 --> 01:34:30,297
Yes, I did, John,
but I had no idea what was going on.

1898
01:34:30,924 --> 01:34:32,384
- You didn't?
- No.

1899
01:34:34,429 --> 01:34:36,264
That's a swell bracelet you're wearing.

1900
01:34:40,645 --> 01:34:42,314
John, why aren't you
at the convention?

1901
01:34:59,128 --> 01:35:00,671
Is there anything wrong?

1902
01:35:00,755 --> 01:35:02,382
No, no, nothing's wrong.

1903
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:04,010
Everything's fine.

1904
01:35:05,052 --> 01:35:07,472
So there's going to be
a new order of things, huh?

1905
01:35:07,556 --> 01:35:08,850
Everybody's gonna
cut himself a nice fat slice

1906
01:35:08,933 --> 01:35:11,187
of the John Does, eh?

1907
01:35:12,438 --> 01:35:14,399
You forgot one detail, Mr. Big Shot.

1908
01:35:14,483 --> 01:35:17,445
You forgot me,
the prize stooge of the world.

1909
01:35:17,945 --> 01:35:19,948
Why, if you or
anybody else thinks he's gonna use

1910
01:35:20,031 --> 01:35:22,160
the John Doe Clubs
for his own rotten purpose,

1911
01:35:22,243 --> 01:35:24,454
he's gonna have to
do it over my dead body.

1912
01:35:24,536 --> 01:35:26,749
Well, hold on a minute,
young man, hold on.

1913
01:35:26,832 --> 01:35:28,293
That's rather big talk.

1914
01:35:28,376 --> 01:35:31,213
I started
the John Doe Clubs with my money,

1915
01:35:31,297 --> 01:35:33,592
and I'll decide whether or
not they're being properly used.

1916
01:35:33,674 --> 01:35:34,426
No, you won't.

1917
01:35:34,509 --> 01:35:36,930
You're through deciding
anything and what's more,

1918
01:35:37,013 --> 01:35:38,764
I'm going down to
that convention and I'm gonna tell

1919
01:35:38,848 --> 01:35:42,811
those people exactly what you and all
your fine feathered friends here

1920
01:35:42,896 --> 01:35:44,356
are trying to cook up for them,

1921
01:35:45,149 --> 01:35:47,401
and I'm gonna say it
in my own words this time.

1922
01:35:52,283 --> 01:35:53,452
He'll ruin us, D.B.!

1923
01:35:53,536 --> 01:35:55,162
Wait a minute, wait a minute, fella.

1924
01:35:55,412 --> 01:35:57,039
My uncle wants to talk to you.

1925
01:35:57,123 --> 01:35:58,583
Listen to me, my son.

1926
01:35:59,168 --> 01:36:01,003
Before you lose your head completely,

1927
01:36:01,087 --> 01:36:03,840
may I remind you that I picked
you up out of the gutter,

1928
01:36:03,924 --> 01:36:05,843
and I can throw
you right back there again.

1929
01:36:06,301 --> 01:36:08,889
You've got a nerve
accusing people of things.

1930
01:36:08,972 --> 01:36:10,307
These gentlemen and I know what's best

1931
01:36:10,392 --> 01:36:11,892
for the John Does of America,

1932
01:36:11,977 --> 01:36:14,355
regardless of what tramps like you think.

1933
01:36:15,773 --> 01:36:18,987
Get off that righteous horse of yours
and come to your senses.

1934
01:36:19,070 --> 01:36:20,113
You're the fake.

1935
01:36:20,196 --> 01:36:21,990
We believe in what we're doing.

1936
01:36:22,074 --> 01:36:24,325
You're the one that was paid
the 30 pieces of silver.

1937
01:36:24,410 --> 01:36:25,328
Have you forgotten that?

1938
01:36:25,411 --> 01:36:26,621
Well, I haven't.

1939
01:36:26,705 --> 01:36:29,041
You're a fake,
John Doe, and I can prove it.

1940
01:36:29,416 --> 01:36:33,046
You're the big hero that's supposed
to jump off tall buildings and things.

1941
01:36:33,131 --> 01:36:34,090
You remember?

1942
01:36:34,173 --> 01:36:36,135
What do you suppose
your precious John Does will say

1943
01:36:36,218 --> 01:36:38,178
when they find out
that you never had any intention

1944
01:36:38,262 --> 01:36:40,639
of doing it,
that you were being paid to say so?

1945
01:36:41,224 --> 01:36:43,310
You're lucky they don't
run you out of the country.

1946
01:36:43,644 --> 01:36:46,982
With the newspapers and radio stations
that these gentlemen control,

1947
01:36:47,065 --> 01:36:49,569
we can kill the John Doe movement
deader than a doornail.

1948
01:36:49,651 --> 01:36:51,864
We'll do it too
the moment you step out of line.

1949
01:36:53,742 --> 01:36:55,452
Now, if you still want
to go to that convention

1950
01:36:55,535 --> 01:36:58,331
and shoot your trap off,
you go ahead and do it.

1951
01:37:06,550 --> 01:37:09,220
You mean to tell me you'd try to kill
the John Doe movement if you can't use it

1952
01:37:09,304 --> 01:37:11,431
to get what you want?

1953
01:37:11,515 --> 01:37:13,644
You bet your bottom dollar we would.

1954
01:37:19,985 --> 01:37:22,113
Well, that certainly is a new low.

1955
01:37:23,239 --> 01:37:26,327
Huh. I guess I've seen everything now.

1956
01:37:28,245 --> 01:37:30,333
You sit there back of
your big cigars and

1957
01:37:30,416 --> 01:37:32,001
think of deliberately
killing an idea that's made

1958
01:37:32,085 --> 01:37:34,380
millions of people a little bit happier,

1959
01:37:34,921 --> 01:37:36,675
an idea that's
brought thousands of 'em here

1960
01:37:36,757 --> 01:37:39,678
from all over
the country by bus and by freight

1961
01:37:39,762 --> 01:37:42,849
and jalopies and on foot so
they can pass on to each other

1962
01:37:42,933 --> 01:37:45,269
their own simple little experiences.

1963
01:37:46,019 --> 01:37:49,274
Why look, I'm just a mug and I know it,

1964
01:37:49,358 --> 01:37:51,528
but I'm beginning to understand
a lot of things.

1965
01:37:51,610 --> 01:37:53,196
Why, your type's as old as history.

1966
01:37:53,280 --> 01:37:55,784
If you can't lay
your dirty fingers on a decent idea

1967
01:37:55,867 --> 01:37:57,619
and twist it and squeeze it and stuff it

1968
01:37:57,702 --> 01:37:59,414
into your own pocket, you slap it down.

1969
01:37:59,497 --> 01:38:02,292
Like dogs, if you can't
eat something, you bury it.

1970
01:38:03,335 --> 01:38:06,004
Why, this is the one
worthwhile thing that's come along.

1971
01:38:06,256 --> 01:38:09,634
People are finally finding out that
the guy next door isn't a bad egg.

1972
01:38:09,719 --> 01:38:10,970
That's simple, isn't it?

1973
01:38:11,054 --> 01:38:12,430
And yet a thing like
that's got a chance of spreading

1974
01:38:12,514 --> 01:38:15,602
'til it touches every last
doggone human being in the world,

1975
01:38:15,686 --> 01:38:18,021
and you talk about killing it.

1976
01:38:18,272 --> 01:38:20,607
Well, when this fire dies down,
what's going to be left?

1977
01:38:20,692 --> 01:38:23,112
More misery, more hunger, and more hate,

1978
01:38:23,195 --> 01:38:25,532
and what's to prevent
that from starting all over again?

1979
01:38:26,032 --> 01:38:28,578
Nobody knows the answer
to that one, and certainly not you,

1980
01:38:28,661 --> 01:38:31,039
with those slimy,
bollixed up theories you got.

1981
01:38:31,123 --> 01:38:33,125
The John Doe idea
may be the answer, though.

1982
01:38:33,209 --> 01:38:34,835
It may be the one thing capable of saving

1983
01:38:34,919 --> 01:38:37,006
this cock-eyed world,
yet you sit back there

1984
01:38:37,089 --> 01:38:39,092
on your fat hulks
and tell me you'll kill it

1985
01:38:39,176 --> 01:38:40,302
if you can't use it.

1986
01:38:40,385 --> 01:38:41,846
Well, you go ahead and try.

1987
01:38:41,929 --> 01:38:45,017
You couldn't do it in a million years
with all your radio stations

1988
01:38:45,100 --> 01:38:47,644
and all your power because it's bigger
than whether I'm a fake,

1989
01:38:47,729 --> 01:38:49,147
it's bigger than your ambitions,

1990
01:38:49,229 --> 01:38:51,649
and it's bigger than all the bracelets
and fur coats in the world!

1991
01:38:51,734 --> 01:38:52,903
You bet it is, John.

1992
01:38:52,985 --> 01:38:55,281
And that's exactly what I'm going
down there to tell those people.

1993
01:38:59,286 --> 01:39:00,997
Wait a minute you ungrateful rat!

1994
01:39:01,080 --> 01:39:02,247
My uncle's been too good to--

1995
01:39:04,001 --> 01:39:05,961
He's getting away.

1996
01:39:06,045 --> 01:39:08,006
- John!
- Get me the <i>Bulletin.</i>

1997
01:39:09,717 --> 01:39:10,884
John!

1998
01:39:11,302 --> 01:39:14,056
I've always told you, D.B.,
you're playing with dynamite.

1999
01:39:15,850 --> 01:39:17,268
Don't let that girl get away.

2000
01:39:18,270 --> 01:39:20,021
Before he gets
through tonight, he'll ruin us all.

2001
01:39:20,105 --> 01:39:22,734
I'll stop him, I'll stop him cold.
Don't worry, I've been ready for this.

2002
01:39:22,818 --> 01:39:24,111
John!

2003
01:39:24,195 --> 01:39:26,072
Oh John, please listen to me.

2004
01:39:26,155 --> 01:39:28,158
Please, I can explain everything, John.

2005
01:39:28,242 --> 01:39:29,327
I didn't know what they were going to do.

2006
01:39:29,409 --> 01:39:31,621
Let me go with you, John.

2007
01:39:31,704 --> 01:39:32,581
John, please!

2008
01:39:32,664 --> 01:39:33,414
Go ahead, driver.

2009
01:39:33,499 --> 01:39:34,583
Ball park.

2010
01:39:34,667 --> 01:39:35,669
Let me explain it to you, John.

2011
01:39:35,752 --> 01:39:37,545
Please let me go with you.

2012
01:39:37,629 --> 01:39:39,382
Please, John.

2013
01:39:40,299 --> 01:39:41,635
Mr. Norton wants to see you.

2014
01:39:41,718 --> 01:39:43,261
Listen to me, Mayor Lovett.
You do as I say.

2015
01:39:43,345 --> 01:39:44,514
I want them both arrested.

2016
01:39:44,597 --> 01:39:46,099
You tell the police
department to pick up Connell.

2017
01:39:46,182 --> 01:39:47,393
- I've got the girl here.
- I've got the Bulletin.

2018
01:39:47,476 --> 01:39:48,644
I don't care what you charge them with.

2019
01:39:48,727 --> 01:39:49,728
If you're worried,
let them go in the morning,

2020
01:39:49,813 --> 01:39:51,273
but keep them in jail overnight.

One moment, John.

2054
01:41:43,800 --> 01:41:46,387
We'll begin with a short prayer.

2055
01:41:49,391 --> 01:41:50,391
Quiet, please.

2056
01:41:52,227 --> 01:41:57,067
Ladies and gentlemen,
let us have a moment of silent prayer

2057
01:41:57,152 --> 01:42:00,114
for the John Does all over the world,

2058
01:42:00,823 --> 01:42:04,703
many of whom are homeless and hungry.

2059
01:42:05,913 --> 01:42:07,080
Rise, please.

2060
01:42:08,666 --> 01:42:09,752
Everybody rise.

2061
01:43:01,571 --> 01:43:03,448
News boys, hundreds of yelling news boys

2062
01:43:03,533 --> 01:43:05,494
are swarming into the park like locusts.

2063
01:43:05,577 --> 01:43:07,246
- They're yelling, John Doe's a fake.
- Fake?

2064
01:43:20,514 --> 01:43:22,808
Federal investigation
urged by Chamber of Commerce.

2065
01:43:22,892 --> 01:43:24,060
How could he be a fake?

2066
01:43:24,144 --> 01:43:26,188
Must be some kind of a gag.

2067
01:43:26,272 --> 01:43:27,022
A what?

2068
01:43:27,106 --> 01:43:28,108
A gag, a gag!

2069
01:43:39,874 --> 01:43:41,082
Come on, come on, step on it!

2070
01:43:43,044 --> 01:43:44,254
Step on it, step on it!

2071
01:43:44,337 --> 01:43:45,882
You all know
your places now, so let's get going.

2072
01:43:45,965 --> 01:43:47,048
Wait for the signal.

2073
01:43:47,133 --> 01:43:48,509
Hey, mister, will
you autograph my balloon?

2074
01:43:48,594 --> 01:43:50,137
Sure.

2075
01:43:58,982 --> 01:44:01,736
Ladies and gentlemen,

2076
01:44:01,819 --> 01:44:05,366
this is exactly what I came down here
to tell you about tonight.

2077
01:44:06,951 --> 01:44:09,163
Please, if you'll all just
be quiet for a few minutes,

2078
01:44:09,246 --> 01:44:11,374
I can explain this whole thing to you.

2079
01:44:13,459 --> 01:44:15,838
As you all know,
this paper is published by a man

2080
01:44:15,922 --> 01:44:17,633
by the name of DB. Norton.

2081
01:44:18,008 --> 01:44:19,134
Get back, you!

2082
01:44:19,886 --> 01:44:22,055
Wait a minute, everybody.
Wait a minute.

2083
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:28,356
Wait a minute, ladies and gentlemen.
My name is D.B. Norton.

2084
01:44:28,648 --> 01:44:29,857
You all know me.

2085
01:44:30,483 --> 01:44:32,945
I accuse this man of being a faker.

2086
01:44:33,028 --> 01:44:34,279
We've been taken for a lot of suckers,

2087
01:44:34,364 --> 01:44:36,325
and I'm the biggest of the lot.

2088
01:44:36,408 --> 01:44:38,369
I spent a fortune
backing this man in what I believed

2089
01:44:38,452 --> 01:44:42,291
to be a sincere and
worthy cause, just as you all did,

2090
01:44:42,375 --> 01:44:44,751
and now I find out it's
nothing but a cheap racket,

2091
01:44:44,836 --> 01:44:47,005
cooked up by him and two of my employees

2092
01:44:47,089 --> 01:44:49,342
for the sole purpose of collecting dues

2093
01:44:49,425 --> 01:44:51,345
from John Does all over the country.

2094
01:44:51,428 --> 01:44:52,638
- That's a lie!
- It's not a lie!

2095
01:44:52,721 --> 01:44:54,641
Nickel and dimes to
stuff into their own pockets.

2096
01:44:54,724 --> 01:44:56,936
You can read all about
it in the newspapers there.

2097
01:44:57,019 --> 01:44:57,769
That's a lie!

2098
01:44:57,853 --> 01:44:59,730
- Listen, don't believe what he--
- Let go of me!

2099
01:44:59,815 --> 01:45:02,318
This man had no intention of jumping off
the top of a building.

2100
01:45:02,401 --> 01:45:03,695
He was paid to say so.

2101
01:45:03,778 --> 01:45:04,947
Do you deny that?

2102
01:45:05,030 --> 01:45:06,115
That's got nothing to do with it.

2103
01:45:06,198 --> 01:45:07,701
Were you paid for it or weren't you?

2104
01:45:07,784 --> 01:45:09,160
Yes, I was paid, but there has to be--

2105
01:45:09,244 --> 01:45:11,455
And what about the suicide note?
You didn't write that either.

2106
01:45:11,538 --> 01:45:13,375
- What difference does that make?
- Did you write it or didn't you?

2107
01:45:13,458 --> 01:45:15,918
- No, I didn't write it.
- Oh, you bet your life you didn't.

2108
01:45:16,003 --> 01:45:17,547
You look in your papers,
ladies and gentlemen,

2109
01:45:17,629 --> 01:45:19,590
and you'll find
Miss Mitchell's signed confession

2110
01:45:19,675 --> 01:45:21,302
that she was the one who wrote it.

2111
01:45:21,385 --> 01:45:23,470
Listen, folks, it's a fact that
I didn't write the letter.

2112
01:45:23,555 --> 01:45:26,516
Now you see, he admits it.
You're a fake, John Doe.

2113
01:45:26,976 --> 01:45:29,104
For what you have
done to all these good people,

2114
01:45:29,187 --> 01:45:31,399
they ought to run you out of the country,

2115
01:45:31,482 --> 01:45:32,692
and I hope they do it.

2116
01:45:41,997 --> 01:45:42,955
Speak up, John.

2117
01:45:43,040 --> 01:45:44,082
We believe you.

2118
01:45:44,165 --> 01:45:45,543
Please listen, folks.

2119
01:45:46,251 --> 01:45:47,921
Now that he's
through shooting off his face,

2120
01:45:48,005 --> 01:45:50,717
I got a couple of
things to tell you ab--

2121
01:45:50,800 --> 01:45:52,719
Come on, the rest of
you get in here and riot.

2122
01:45:52,802 --> 01:45:53,637
Break this crowd up, come on.

2123
01:45:53,721 --> 01:45:55,597
I'm sorry, folks,
but we can't hear him anymore.

2124
01:45:55,681 --> 01:45:58,101
Something's gone
wrong with the loudspeakers.

2125
01:45:59,479 --> 01:46:02,274
John Doe's a fake! Boo!

2126
01:46:02,358 --> 01:46:03,650
Say, they can't hear me.

2127
01:46:06,488 --> 01:46:07,990
This thing's not working.

2128
01:46:08,074 --> 01:46:10,744
Ladies and gentlemen.

2129
01:46:27,475 --> 01:46:29,852
This thing's bigger
than whether I'm a fake.

2130
01:46:31,771 --> 01:46:34,567
Look, Bert, you believe me, don't ya?

2131
01:46:35,151 --> 01:46:37,571
Sure, I believe you.

2132
01:46:37,655 --> 01:46:41,869
Walking my legs off picking up
5,000 signatures for a phony.

2133
01:46:41,953 --> 01:46:43,538
Well, there you are, Mr. Doe.

2134
01:46:43,621 --> 01:46:47,127
5,000 names asking
you not to jump off any roof.

2135
01:46:47,210 --> 01:46:48,460
Makes no difference, Bert.

2136
01:46:48,545 --> 01:46:49,462
The idea's still good.

2137
01:46:49,545 --> 01:46:50,840
We don't have to give up our club.

2138
01:46:50,923 --> 01:46:53,676
Yeah, well you can have it.

2139
01:46:56,055 --> 01:46:57,515
They're starting to throw things.

2140
01:46:57,597 --> 01:46:58,725
Somebody's going to get hurt.

2141
01:46:58,808 --> 01:47:00,811
<i>I'm afraid it will be John Doe.</i>

2142
01:47:00,893 --> 01:47:02,313
<i>Listen to that mob.</i>

2143
01:47:05,234 --> 01:47:06,734
I've got to go to him.

2144
01:47:06,819 --> 01:47:09,655
- Sorry, lady, I can't let you out.
- Oh, let me go!

2145
01:47:09,739 --> 01:47:10,491
I want to go to him!

2146
01:47:10,575 --> 01:47:12,493
Oh, please, please let me go!

2147
01:47:12,577 --> 01:47:15,038
- They're crucifying him. I can help him!
- Sorry, sister.

2148
01:47:15,121 --> 01:47:16,707
- We got orders to hold you.
- Orders from who?

2149
01:47:16,791 --> 01:47:17,792
Can't you see it's a frame-up?

2150
01:47:17,876 --> 01:47:20,587
- Ann, darling.
- Oh, Mother, they won't let me go.

2151
01:47:20,671 --> 01:47:22,548
They won't let me go.

2152
01:47:22,632 --> 01:47:25,011
Listen, folks.

2153
01:47:26,262 --> 01:47:28,182
You gotta listen to me, everybody.

2154
01:47:28,474 --> 01:47:30,685
Back to the jungle, you hobo.

2155
01:47:30,768 --> 01:47:32,228
Just another racket!

2156
01:47:33,396 --> 01:47:34,773
Stick to your clubs.

2157
01:47:35,024 --> 01:47:37,151
We've been fed baloney
so long we're getting used to it.

2158
01:47:46,331 --> 01:47:48,501
The idea is still good.

2159
01:47:50,504 --> 01:47:51,713
Believe me, folks.

2160
01:47:54,634 --> 01:47:57,179
Listen, John Does.
You're the hope of the world.

2161
01:48:34,896 --> 01:48:36,565
Police finally managed
to get him out of the park.

2162
01:48:36,649 --> 01:48:38,819
If that boy isn't hurt, it'd be a miracle.

2163
01:48:38,901 --> 01:48:40,111
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
this certainly looks like</i>

2164
01:48:40,195 --> 01:48:42,949
<i>the end of the John Doe movement.</i>

2165
01:48:43,867 --> 01:48:47,622
Well, boys, you can chalk up
another one to the Pontius Pilates.

2166
01:48:55,174 --> 01:48:56,718
I should have been there.

2167
01:48:57,635 --> 01:48:59,305
I could have helped him.

2168
01:49:01,391 --> 01:49:03,226
He was so all alone.

2169
01:49:06,732 --> 01:49:09,527
A lot of us gonna be mighty ashamed
of ourselves after tonight.

2170
01:49:10,528 --> 01:49:13,114
We certainly didn't give
that man much of a chance.

2171
01:49:23,003 --> 01:49:25,798
Have some more coffee, Long John?

2172
01:49:25,881 --> 01:49:27,426
No thanks, Colonel.

2173
01:49:48,454 --> 01:49:49,122
Fake!

2174
01:49:49,206 --> 01:49:49,872
Racketeer!

2175
01:49:49,956 --> 01:49:50,666
Liar!

2176
01:49:50,749 --> 01:49:51,500
Cheat!

2177
01:49:51,582 --> 01:49:52,460
Impostor!

2178
01:49:52,543 --> 01:49:53,628
Why don't you jump?

2179
01:49:53,711 --> 01:49:55,381
Christmas Eve at midnight.

2180
01:49:57,216 --> 01:49:59,344
Goodbye, Mr. Doe.

2181
01:49:59,427 --> 01:50:01,639
You're a wonderful man.

2182
01:50:01,722 --> 01:50:03,891
God bless you, my boy.

2183
01:50:05,310 --> 01:50:06,771
Now get in there and pitch.

2184
01:50:10,692 --> 01:50:12,946
You're a fake,
John Doe, and I can prove it.

2185
01:50:13,028 --> 01:50:14,072
You're the big hero that's supposed

2186
01:50:14,155 --> 01:50:16,742
to jump off tall buildings and things.

2187
01:50:16,826 --> 01:50:17,744
You remember?

2188
01:50:17,828 --> 01:50:19,496
What do you suppose
your precious John Does will say

2189
01:50:19,579 --> 01:50:21,749
when they find out
that you never had any intention

2190
01:50:21,833 --> 01:50:24,335
of doing it,
that you were being paid to say so?

2191
01:50:24,420 --> 01:50:26,131
Christmas Eve, at midnight.

2192
01:50:27,881 --> 01:50:34,600
♪ Silent night, holy night ♪

2193
01:50:35,183 --> 01:50:41,859
♪ Shepherds quake at the sight ♪

2194
01:50:42,444 --> 01:50:49,245
♪ Glories stream from heaven afar ♪

2195
01:50:49,871 --> 01:50:51,665
Merry Christmas, sir.

2196
01:50:51,749 --> 01:50:54,001
Oh, Merry Christmas.

2197
01:50:57,673 --> 01:51:03,639
♪ Christ the Savior is born ♪

2198
01:51:05,433 --> 01:51:11,942
♪ Christ the Savior is born ♪

2199
01:51:21,538 --> 01:51:22,331
Who?

2200
01:51:22,413 --> 01:51:23,874
John Doe?

2201
01:51:23,958 --> 01:51:26,045
Is that screwball still around?

2202
01:51:26,128 --> 01:51:28,297
That dame's been calling all day.

2203
01:51:28,380 --> 01:51:29,883
Sure, sure, I know.

2204
01:51:29,965 --> 01:51:31,300
Yeah, at midnight, huh?

2205
01:51:32,220 --> 01:51:33,304
Okay, lady.

2206
01:51:33,386 --> 01:51:35,432
We'll have the place surrounded with nets.

2207
01:51:35,766 --> 01:51:38,602
They're laughing at me.

2208
01:51:44,486 --> 01:51:45,445
You're a sick girl, Ann.

2209
01:51:45,529 --> 01:51:47,573
You better take it easy.

2210
01:51:49,660 --> 01:51:51,955
Who are you calling now?

2211
01:51:52,038 --> 01:51:55,835
You called
that number not ten minutes ago.

2212
01:51:55,918 --> 01:51:57,170
Hello, Mr. Connell.

2213
01:51:57,254 --> 01:51:58,380
Have you seen him yet?

2214
01:51:58,462 --> 01:51:59,214
Now listen, Ann.

2215
01:51:59,297 --> 01:52:01,883
He can't possibly get
in without our seeing him.

2216
01:52:01,968 --> 01:52:04,137
I'm watching the side
door and the Colonel's out front,

2217
01:52:04,221 --> 01:52:06,307
so stop worrying.

2218
01:52:06,391 --> 01:52:07,724
Oh, thank you.

2219
01:52:15,403 --> 01:52:16,320
Why, Ann!

2220
01:52:16,404 --> 01:52:19,157
Ann, don't be foolish.

2221
01:52:21,995 --> 01:52:23,622
If this isn't the craziest, the battiest,

2222
01:52:23,706 --> 01:52:26,209
the looniest wild
goose chase I ever heard of.

2223
01:52:26,293 --> 01:52:27,043
Oh, shut up, Bert.

2224
01:52:27,127 --> 01:52:28,169
Sourpuss is right.

2225
01:52:28,254 --> 01:52:30,172
Yeah, well if he is, I'm a banana split.

2226
01:52:30,256 --> 01:52:31,842
That man's gonna be on that roof.

2227
01:52:31,925 --> 01:52:33,886
Don't ask me how I know, I just know,

2228
01:52:33,970 --> 01:52:35,138
and you know it as well as I do.

2229
01:52:35,221 --> 01:52:37,349
Sure, sure, I'd like
to believe in fairy tales,

2230
01:52:37,433 --> 01:52:39,977
but a guy that's a fake
isn't gonna jump off any roof.

2231
01:52:40,061 --> 01:52:41,980
I don't think he was
any fake, not with that face,

2232
01:52:42,062 --> 01:52:44,442
and any way,
what he stood for wasn't a fake.

2233
01:52:44,525 --> 01:52:46,193
Okay, honey, okay.

2234
01:53:06,430 --> 01:53:08,642
Elevators ain't runnin'.

2235
01:53:08,725 --> 01:53:09,768
Colonel.

2236
01:53:09,851 --> 01:53:11,604
You shouldn't've got out of bed, Miss.

2237
01:53:11,687 --> 01:53:12,647
Has he been here?

2238
01:53:12,729 --> 01:53:13,481
No.

2239
01:53:13,564 --> 01:53:14,315
Have you seen him?

2240
01:53:14,399 --> 01:53:15,150
I ain't seen him for a week.

2241
01:53:15,233 --> 01:53:15,984
Where's Connell?

2242
01:53:16,068 --> 01:53:16,903
He's watching the other door.

2243
01:53:16,986 --> 01:53:19,490
Oh, gee, you're swell.

2244
01:53:24,662 --> 01:53:25,873
No sense in going up there.

2245
01:53:25,957 --> 01:53:26,791
I been here for hours.

2246
01:53:26,874 --> 01:53:27,625
He ain't here.

2247
01:53:27,707 --> 01:53:29,168
Let me go, will ya?

2248
01:53:33,717 --> 01:53:34,718
Now, that's crazy.

2249
01:53:34,802 --> 01:53:36,011
It's 14 floors.

2250
01:54:19,195 --> 01:54:20,739
It's as far as the elevator goes.

2251
01:54:20,822 --> 01:54:22,491
We gotta walk up to the tower.

2252
01:55:13,560 --> 01:55:15,270
That tramp is
probably full of Christmas cheer

2253
01:55:15,354 --> 01:55:16,981
and asleep in some flophouse.

2254
01:55:17,065 --> 01:55:17,816
Let's go.

2255
01:55:17,898 --> 01:55:20,319
I've got to decorate my tree.

2256
01:55:31,960 --> 01:55:33,462
Well, I give up.

2257
01:55:34,421 --> 01:55:35,631
I don't what gave us the idea

2258
01:55:35,714 --> 01:55:38,093
he'd attempt anything like this.

2259
01:55:38,176 --> 01:55:39,345
I guess you're right.

2260
01:55:39,428 --> 01:55:41,388
I'm afraid the joke's on us.

2261
01:55:41,473 --> 01:55:42,224
Let's go.

2262
01:55:42,307 --> 01:55:44,394
I hope nobody finds out we've been here.

2263
01:57:30,244 --> 01:57:32,289
I wouldn't do that if I were you, John.

2264
01:57:44,264 --> 01:57:46,016
It'll do you no good.

2265
01:57:46,892 --> 01:57:50,439
The Mayor has policemen
downstairs with instructions

2266
01:57:50,522 --> 01:57:52,107
to remove all marks of identification

2267
01:57:52,189 --> 01:57:53,526
you may have on your person.

2268
01:57:55,070 --> 01:57:57,030
You'll be buried in Potter's Field,

2269
01:57:57,114 --> 01:57:58,825
and you'll have accomplished nothing.

2270
01:58:09,882 --> 01:58:12,051
I've taken care of that.

2271
01:58:13,053 --> 01:58:17,809
I've already mailed
a copy of this letter to Mr. Connell.

2272
01:58:19,102 --> 01:58:21,105
John, why don't
you forget this foolishness?

2273
01:58:21,189 --> 01:58:22,731
Stop right where you are, Mr. Norton,

2274
01:58:22,815 --> 01:58:25,027
if you don't want to go overboard with me.

2275
01:58:29,575 --> 01:58:31,786
I'm glad you gentlemen are here.

2276
01:58:33,954 --> 01:58:37,418
You killed
the John Doe movement, all right,

2277
01:58:37,502 --> 01:58:41,174
but you're gonna
see it born all over again.

2278
01:58:47,807 --> 01:58:49,643
Now, take a good look, Mr. Norton.

2279
01:58:51,020 --> 01:58:51,854
John!

2280
01:58:52,981 --> 01:58:53,816
John!

2281
01:58:54,733 --> 01:58:57,028
Oh, John, don't do it!

2282
01:58:57,112 --> 01:58:59,782
I won't let you.
I love you, darling.

2283
01:58:59,865 --> 01:59:03,454
Oh, please, please don't give up.

2284
01:59:03,538 --> 01:59:05,206
We'll start all over again.

2285
01:59:05,289 --> 01:59:06,582
Just you and I.

2286
01:59:06,667 --> 01:59:07,501
It isn't too late.

2287
01:59:07,584 --> 01:59:10,964
The John Doe movement isn't dead yet.

2288
01:59:11,047 --> 01:59:13,258
You see, John, it isn't
dead or they wouldn't be here.

2289
01:59:13,342 --> 01:59:14,928
It's alive in them.

2290
01:59:15,011 --> 01:59:17,388
They kept it alive by being afraid of it.

2291
01:59:17,472 --> 01:59:19,267
That's why they came up here.

2292
01:59:19,349 --> 01:59:22,770
Oh, darling, sure
it should have been killed.

2293
01:59:22,855 --> 01:59:25,817
It was dishonest,
but we can start clean now,

2294
01:59:25,900 --> 01:59:27,361
just you and I.

2295
01:59:27,445 --> 01:59:28,864
It'll grow, John, and it'll grow big

2296
01:59:28,947 --> 01:59:31,783
because it'll be honest this time.

2297
01:59:32,910 --> 01:59:37,917
Oh, John, if it's worth
dying for, it's worth living for.

2298
01:59:38,209 --> 01:59:39,878
Oh, please, John!

2299
01:59:40,588 --> 01:59:44,843
Oh, oh please!

2300
01:59:44,925 --> 01:59:47,513
Please God, help me!

2301
01:59:49,891 --> 01:59:50,684
John!

2302
01:59:51,268 --> 01:59:52,520
John, look at me!

2303
01:59:53,104 --> 01:59:55,316
You want to be honest, don't you?

2304
01:59:55,398 --> 01:59:58,111
You don't have to die to
keep the John Doe idea alive.

2305
01:59:58,195 --> 02:00:02,033
Someone already died for
that once, the first John Doe,

2306
02:00:02,783 --> 02:00:05,579
and He's kept that idea
alive for nearly 2,000 years.

2307
02:00:05,914 --> 02:00:08,249
It was He who kept
it alive in them, and He'll go on

2308
02:00:08,333 --> 02:00:10,461
keeping it alive forever and always.

2309
02:00:11,003 --> 02:00:12,589
For every John Doe
movement these men kill,

2310
02:00:12,672 --> 02:00:14,425
a new one will be born.

2311
02:00:15,134 --> 02:00:16,927
That's why those bells are ringing, John.

2312
02:00:17,177 --> 02:00:18,513
They're calling to us.

2313
02:00:18,597 --> 02:00:21,976
Not to give up, but keep
on fighting, to keep on pitching.

2314
02:00:22,059 --> 02:00:24,188
Oh, don't you see, darling?

2315
02:00:24,271 --> 02:00:26,565
This is no time to give up.

2316
02:00:26,650 --> 02:00:28,778
You and I John, we, oh no!

2317
02:00:30,196 --> 02:00:32,824
Oh, no! No, John!

2318
02:00:32,908 --> 02:00:35,286
If you die, I want to die, too.

2319
02:00:35,620 --> 02:00:38,040
Oh. Oh, I love you.

2320
02:00:52,851 --> 02:00:58,776
Mr. Doe, you don't have to...
we're with you, Mr. Doe.

2321
02:00:58,859 --> 02:01:01,071
We just lost
our heads and acted like a mob.

2322
02:01:01,196 --> 02:01:04,742
What Bert's trying to say
is that we need you, Mr. Doe.

2323
02:01:04,826 --> 02:01:05,578
There were a lot of us

2324
02:01:05,661 --> 02:01:07,162
that didn't believe what that man said.

2325
02:01:07,954 --> 02:01:10,125
We were going to start
up our John Doe Club again,

2326
02:01:10,208 --> 02:01:12,420
whether we saw
you or not, weren't we, Bert?

2327
02:01:12,503 --> 02:01:13,337
And there were a lot of others

2328
02:01:13,420 --> 02:01:15,006
there were gonna do the same thing.

2329
02:01:15,090 --> 02:01:16,383
Well, Mr. Sourpuss even got a letter

2330
02:01:16,466 --> 02:01:18,011
from his cousin in Toledo.

2331
02:01:18,094 --> 02:01:19,304
I got it right here, Mr. Doe.

2332
02:01:19,387 --> 02:01:22,391
Only, it'd be a lot easier with you.

2333
02:01:22,474 --> 02:01:27,481
Please, please come with us, Mr. Doe.

2334
02:01:53,475 --> 02:01:54,518
Long John!

2335
02:01:54,602 --> 02:01:56,270
Mr. Doe!

2336
02:01:56,354 --> 02:01:57,564
Here, we'll help you with her.

2337
02:01:57,648 --> 02:01:58,398
She'll be all right.

2338
02:01:58,481 --> 02:02:01,444
Mr. Doe,
take her right down to the car.

2339
02:02:01,527 --> 02:02:03,405
We got a car right down there.

2340
02:02:03,489 --> 02:02:05,115
There you are, Norton, the people!

2341
02:02:05,199 --> 02:02:06,368
Try and lick that!
