2
00:02:33,112 --> 00:02:35,020
Ja, wunderbar.

3
00:02:52,582 --> 00:02:53,845
Look at that Karl.

4
00:03:03,314 --> 00:03:08,483
- Well Roy, you seem to like my country.
- Like it? I think it's marvelous.

5
00:03:08,513 --> 00:03:11,172
Say, I wish we were staying here
two years instead of just two weeks.

6
00:03:11,589 --> 00:03:14,439
But you know Karl, it does sound
funny hearing you call it your country.

7
00:03:14,921 --> 00:03:17,693
- I keep forgetting you're not English.
- Oh, sometimes I...

8
00:03:18,149 --> 00:03:20,384
- Oh, I feel almost English myself.
- Well...

9
00:03:20,414 --> 00:03:23,080
that's natural, after
all you can't be at Oxford...

10
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:25,397
3 years without feeling slightly British.

11
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:42,447
I wish Helen were here.

12
00:03:43,191 --> 00:03:45,571
After all you've said
about her, I don't blame you.

13
00:03:50,286 --> 00:03:52,929
Your brother is not
coming today Herr Rutledge?

14
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,754
Oh yes, he'll be along soon Gretchen, nothing
can keep Monte away from this good beer.

15
00:03:57,253 --> 00:04:01,287
- Nothing except a good looking woman.
- Jawohl.

16
00:04:01,548 --> 00:04:06,312
That brother of yours,
he's a naughty boy but I like him.

17
00:04:06,975 --> 00:04:11,869
- He has a way with them, hey Gretchen?
- You, you don't know half of it.

18
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:16,145
Another conquest for Monte.

19
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:20,608
Yes. I don't know why he wants to
mess about with every woman he meets.

20
00:04:21,181 --> 00:04:25,522
- Yeah but you have Helen.
- I'm not at all sure.

21
00:04:26,700 --> 00:04:30,354
- I'm not half good enough for her.
- She must be a wonderful girl.

22
00:04:30,384 --> 00:04:33,481
Oh, she is, she's marvelous.

23
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,901
You have to meet her
when we get back to Oxford.

24
00:04:35,931 --> 00:04:39,168
- I'd like to.
- Would you like to see what she looks like?

25
00:04:39,533 --> 00:04:42,065
Yes. I didn't know
you had a photograph of her.

26
00:04:42,069 --> 00:04:45,298
Yeah and neither does Helen,
I took it myself when she wasn't looking.

27
00:04:45,328 --> 00:04:46,629
Really?

28
00:04:52,238 --> 00:04:55,168
- Stunning, isn't she?
- Why, she's marvelous.

29
00:05:00,143 --> 00:05:03,423
- Cheerio, you blighters.
- Hello, it's Monte.

30
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:06,910
Meet the countess, step
up gents, to the one and only...

31
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:08,531
- No Monte, don't please.
- Oh, it's all right.

32
00:05:08,561 --> 00:05:10,374
This little pretzel doesn't
understand a word of English.

33
00:05:10,404 --> 00:05:11,848
- No?
- Gretchen.

34
00:05:11,878 --> 00:05:13,488
- Ja.
- Bier.

35
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:23,261
Found at the museum.

36
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:26,649
- She's a work of art alright.
- You should've left her there.

37
00:05:37,549 --> 00:05:38,551
Quiet.

38
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:42,725
I say Monte, why
do you bring around this sort?

39
00:05:42,755 --> 00:05:46,373
Bring her?
Good heavens, I can't get rid of her.

40
00:05:48,234 --> 00:05:50,980
Go home, will you? Go home.

41
00:05:53,948 --> 00:05:55,146
You see, I'm stuck.

42
00:05:56,145 --> 00:05:58,400
- Hello, who's the dowager?
- That's Helen.

43
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:02,825
Oh but of course, that's only a
snapshot, wait till you meet her.

44
00:06:03,619 --> 00:06:05,753
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

45
00:06:06,144 --> 00:06:07,224
Go away.

46
00:06:10,921 --> 00:06:14,467
I say, this is getting
serious, I've got to get rid of her.

47
00:06:14,497 --> 00:06:17,595
Oh, you know, I've a very
important meeting in just 15 minutes.

48
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:20,952
I say you chaps, be, be
sporting and take her off my hands.

49
00:06:20,982 --> 00:06:24,139
But after all Monte, we may be
sporting but we're not feeble minded.

50
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:26,688
Well, you can do what you
please with her, I'm going.

51
00:06:26,718 --> 00:06:29,433
- Hey, listen Monte...
- Auf Wiedersehen.

52
00:06:37,055 --> 00:06:38,585
Here, just a minute now please.

53
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:40,882
Leave her to me, I'll get rid of her.

54
00:06:40,912 --> 00:06:41,746
Please, yes.

55
00:06:50,294 --> 00:06:53,317
- Roy. No Roy...
- No, carry on, carry on.

56
00:07:14,033 --> 00:07:17,125
Pretty boy, you please me very much.

57
00:07:52,861 --> 00:07:53,967
What's that?

58
00:07:56,833 --> 00:08:01,529
It is nothing, I am not at home
to anyone except my husband.

59
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,849
And he is away on army business.
He will not be home for hours.

60
00:08:06,471 --> 00:08:08,218
So, you see...

61
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:26,585
Charming.

62
00:08:36,726 --> 00:08:38,726
But really, I, I say
you mustn't think that...

63
00:08:38,756 --> 00:08:40,092
Your name?

64
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:44,863
My name is Rutledge sir.

65
00:08:44,947 --> 00:08:49,268
- You are stopping in Munich?
- At the Hotel Bayrischer Hof sir.

66
00:09:00,071 --> 00:09:02,892
My seconds will call on you later.

67
00:09:03,898 --> 00:09:08,101
- But I say you...
- There is nothing further to discuss.

- ♪ Sailing, sailing, ♪ England.

71
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:35,288
England? Why, we're
not going back for 10 days.

72
00:09:36,067 --> 00:09:37,123
What's wrong?

73
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,825
- Baron Von Kranz.
- Who's he?

74
00:09:41,909 --> 00:09:43,943
- Oh, he's just a friend of mine.
- Really?

75
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,629
Quite a social success, aren't you?
How do you meet these barons?

76
00:09:47,659 --> 00:09:50,099
Well, unfortunately
I met this one through his wife.

77
00:09:52,143 --> 00:09:55,085
- And this means...
- A duel, can you imagine it?

78
00:09:56,516 --> 00:09:59,132
- Running away?
- Oh, don't be an ass Roy.

79
00:09:59,162 --> 00:10:01,163
You don't expect me to go
through with a farce like this.

80
00:10:01,193 --> 00:10:02,621
But Monty, it's the only thing you can do.

81
00:10:02,651 --> 00:10:03,974
Oh, there you go again.

82
00:10:04,182 --> 00:10:05,973
I suppose when a woman
is no good and her husband...

83
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:08,903
finds it out, I got to get shot just
because is the honorable thing to do.

84
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:11,914
Well, what do you think people
will say? You never live it down.

85
00:10:11,996 --> 00:10:13,860
What do I care what people say?

86
00:10:14,108 --> 00:10:16,596
Well, you can talk all you like
Monte but you can't walk out like this.

87
00:10:16,626 --> 00:10:17,820
Can't I?

88
00:10:19,007 --> 00:10:21,259
Goodbye, see you at Oxford.

89
00:10:30,646 --> 00:10:32,978
- Hello Roy.
- Hello Karl.

90
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,992
OH, what's up? Where's Monte?

91
00:10:36,789 --> 00:10:37,870
Gone to England.

92
00:10:38,261 --> 00:10:41,041
England? Well, what's the matter?

93
00:10:42,983 --> 00:10:45,745
- Oh, nothing.
- But I say...

94
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,404
Herr Rutledge?

95
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:00,269
Herr Rutledge?

96
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,692
- Yes?
- Von Richter.

97
00:11:03,135 --> 00:11:04,398
Von Schlieben.

98
00:11:05,336 --> 00:11:08,983
- We represent Colonel Baron Von Kranz.
- Yes.

99
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:11,680
Have you chosen your second?

100
00:11:17,893 --> 00:11:21,683
According to custom, we have
selected the time and place.

101
00:11:22,164 --> 00:11:23,871
You have the choice of weapons.

102
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:29,876
What is your choice?

103
00:11:46,557 --> 00:11:47,665
What is this?

104
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,234
Golden Ave.

105
00:11:52,901 --> 00:11:55,454
Why, that's a famous dueling place near here.

106
00:11:57,655 --> 00:11:59,818
It says at 4 o'clock tomorrow morning.

107
00:12:00,925 --> 00:12:03,999
- 4 o'clock in the morning.
- Well, how did this happen?

108
00:12:06,539 --> 00:12:10,746
I'm, I'm sorry Karl. I, I lost my
temper with one of your officers.

109
00:12:10,776 --> 00:12:13,686
- But Roy...
- Say Karl, do you know how to be a second?

110
00:12:28,227 --> 00:12:30,454
Wait here Roy.

111
00:12:41,624 --> 00:12:42,679
Bitte.

112
00:13:05,756 --> 00:13:06,993
Good luck Roy.

116
00:14:07,162 --> 00:14:10,223
- Hey, did anybody see my green socks?
- Check in the garbage.

117
00:14:11,004 --> 00:14:13,452
- Hello there Roy.
- Hello Elliot, glad to see you.

118
00:14:13,482 --> 00:14:15,029
- I'm certainly glad to see you back.
- Thank you.

119
00:14:15,059 --> 00:14:16,253
And where's your German accent?

120
00:14:16,283 --> 00:14:18,259
Well, I couldn't get it
past the Custom officials.

121
00:14:19,067 --> 00:14:21,290
Oh I say, what have you done to your arm?

122
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,856
Oh nothing, it's just a little
scratch. I was hunting in Germany.

123
00:14:24,051 --> 00:14:25,537
- I'll see you at dinner?
- Right-O.

124
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:26,605
- Good.
- See you later.

125
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:29,275
Say, why aren't you getting dressed?
Aren't you coming to meet Helen?

126
00:14:29,305 --> 00:14:33,535
- Oh yes but don't remind me of it.
- Don't be foolish, she expects us for tea.

127
00:14:33,678 --> 00:14:34,681
Tea?

128
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:37,013
Listen, it'll do you
good to meet a nice girl.

129
00:14:37,043 --> 00:14:39,376
Oh well alright but first
we got to get you dressed.

130
00:14:39,406 --> 00:14:41,271
Say, we got to get him
dressed, he's going to see his girl.

131
00:14:41,301 --> 00:14:44,498
Now, now, wait a minute now.
Listen, I've got to have my shirt.

132
00:14:46,117 --> 00:14:49,595
Wait a minute, I. Listen,
I'm old enough to dress myself.

133
00:14:49,625 --> 00:14:52,010
- No, you're not.
- Will you cut it out?

134
00:14:52,094 --> 00:14:55,026
Say, listen, will you pl...

135
00:14:55,964 --> 00:14:59,355
- Will you...
- Say, my green socks.

136
00:15:15,986 --> 00:15:18,709
- Is Helen in?
- Miss Helen is not at home sir.

137
00:15:18,739 --> 00:15:21,118
- She's expecting us.
- Would you care to wait?

138
00:15:22,590 --> 00:15:23,840
Yes, thank you.

139
00:15:47,574 --> 00:15:48,746
Fine reception.

140
00:16:10,212 --> 00:16:14,407
- Roy, maybe she's forgotten.
- Not Helen, she's not that sort.

141
00:16:32,762 --> 00:16:37,439
Roy, I feel sick, I, I think I'd better go.

142
00:16:38,071 --> 00:16:40,806
- Monte, will you sit down?
- Oh, I got an awful headache.

143
00:16:41,131 --> 00:16:43,111
I think I'll go to the
chemist and get something for it.

144
00:16:43,141 --> 00:16:44,166
Monte...

145
00:16:54,698 --> 00:16:57,122
- Roy?
- Helen.

146
00:16:57,152 --> 00:16:59,916
Oh, terribly sorry, mother's fault, shopping.

147
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,352
I simply flew. My, isn't it hot?

148
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:05,074
- You shouldn't have hurried so.
- Oh but I wanted to.

149
00:17:05,517 --> 00:17:09,034
Roy, you've no right to
look so cool. I'm broiling. Feel.

150
00:17:10,350 --> 00:17:14,154
- Yes, you are, aren't you?
- No, not one.

151
00:17:14,519 --> 00:17:18,213
- Well, you're so marvelous I, I hardly dare.
- Oh, silly.

152
00:17:22,767 --> 00:17:25,214
Oh, that's better, cigarette Roy?

153
00:17:26,606 --> 00:17:29,560
- I thought your brother was coming.
- Went out with a headache.

154
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,557
Poor boy, it must be the heat.

155
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:46,459
Extra, extra, all about the war.

156
00:18:01,471 --> 00:18:04,465
- Well, they've done it.
- I never thought they would.

157
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:09,394
- I still can't believe it.
- Well, it must be true, it's official.

158
00:18:09,424 --> 00:18:11,272
Oh shut up, I'm trying to think.

159
00:18:12,244 --> 00:18:13,194
It's terrible.

160
00:18:13,897 --> 00:18:17,203
Karl, you won't have to go, will you?

161
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:20,365
Me? Oh Roy, I hope not.

162
00:18:20,638 --> 00:18:25,883
Oh, they can't want me, I'm not a
soldier, what use would I be to them?

163
00:18:27,145 --> 00:18:29,891
I couldn't kill anyone.

164
00:18:30,814 --> 00:18:32,688
They couldn't make me
do that, could they Roy?

165
00:18:33,027 --> 00:18:35,395
Oh, I think it'll all be
over in a couple of weeks.

166
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:39,274
- I'm not so sure.
- I wouldn't worry about it.

167
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:42,359
Then suppose England comes in.

168
00:18:44,051 --> 00:18:49,062
Why Roy, that it'd be horrible.
I never could do that. Why, I love England.

169
00:18:49,092 --> 00:18:50,728
Oh, will you shut up?

170
00:18:52,545 --> 00:18:56,859
Monte, Germany is declared war on France.

171
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:03,145
Oh Roy, how do you spell ecstatic?

172
00:19:18,620 --> 00:19:20,546
Special delivery letter for Karl Arnstedt.

173
00:19:45,014 --> 00:19:47,760
- What's the matter Karl?
- Someone ill?

174
00:20:02,546 --> 00:20:03,496
Karl?

175
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:22,108
May I ask the Prime Minister if he has
any information he can give us today.

176
00:20:23,071 --> 00:20:28,043
Our ambassador at Berlin received
his passport at 7 o'clock last evening.

177
00:20:28,368 --> 00:20:32,546
And since 11 o'clock last
night a state of war has existed...

178
00:20:32,689 --> 00:20:34,941
between Germany and ourselves.

179
00:20:39,392 --> 00:20:40,784
Seven?

180
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:44,324
- What size?
- A seven and a half if you please.

181
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:49,349
I, I'm afraid it's a bit small sir.

182
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:52,160
Move along there,
move along, you'll grow into it.

183
00:20:55,596 --> 00:20:56,962
Present arms.

184
00:20:57,860 --> 00:21:02,442
Come on there, come on, present, arms.

185
00:21:04,225 --> 00:21:06,073
Give it to him, you bloody fool.

186
00:21:06,268 --> 00:21:08,650
Hey, what's wrong
with you? Sleeping sickness?

187
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:14,091
Here, here. Let go of
that gun, you clinging vine.

188
00:21:14,364 --> 00:21:15,665
Let go, do you hear?

189
00:21:16,368 --> 00:21:18,958
God, you're enough to turn a man's stomach.

190
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:22,152
Hey, you with the fallen arches...

191
00:21:23,233 --> 00:21:27,248
- I enlisted Monte, in the Royal Flying Corp.
- You're a fool Roy.

192
00:21:31,992 --> 00:21:34,022
- Really?
- How lovely.

193
00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:36,209
My grandfather was in the guard
during the Revolution.

194
00:21:36,239 --> 00:21:37,133
Oh, he was?

195
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:40,011
- Oh Roy, you look marvelous in uniform.
- Thank you.

196
00:21:40,023 --> 00:21:41,608
- Doesn't he?
- It's ripping.

197
00:21:41,742 --> 00:21:44,134
- Where?
- Tell me, what have you joined?

198
00:21:44,234 --> 00:21:46,468
- The infantry?
- No, the Royal Flying Corp.

199
00:21:49,657 --> 00:21:52,308
And all the misery in
this world has been caused...

200
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:55,466
by and for capitalism.

201
00:21:56,392 --> 00:22:00,335
Why should we fight this war? For capitalism?

202
00:22:02,286 --> 00:22:07,775
You will die, you will die.
All your sons will die for capitalism.

203
00:22:08,375 --> 00:22:12,118
Down with capitalism, down with war.

204
00:22:12,451 --> 00:22:15,802
- Down with the anarchists.
- That's right.

205
00:22:34,706 --> 00:22:37,039
Get back now. Who
do you think you're shoving?

206
00:22:38,155 --> 00:22:39,808
There's the man I'd like to kiss.

207
00:22:39,838 --> 00:22:42,580
- What's the matter? Afraid of a kiss?
- Maybe he's yeller.

208
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,223
Go on you, go on and fight for your country.

209
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:47,748
- Slacker.
- Come on.

210
00:23:08,099 --> 00:23:11,769
But really, you don't understand,
I didn't mean to do anything.

211
00:23:12,810 --> 00:23:15,413
Say, I'd rather marry the girl.

212
00:23:39,015 --> 00:23:40,694
You never get your wings that way.

213
00:23:40,724 --> 00:23:43,050
- Hi, how are you?
- Oh boy.

214
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,913
Say listen, that first
solo flight certainly is a great thrill.

215
00:23:46,238 --> 00:23:47,995
It certainly felt great.

216
00:23:53,839 --> 00:23:55,037
I will.

217
00:24:09,327 --> 00:24:10,772
Look boys, it's Monte.

218
00:24:16,264 --> 00:24:19,544
- Hey, how it go Monte?
- Oh, great.

219
00:24:51,281 --> 00:24:53,949
- Well, tonight is the night Monte.
- Yeah.

220
00:24:54,294 --> 00:24:57,313
Say listen, be more cheerful, you
have a treat in store meeting Helen.

221
00:24:57,343 --> 00:24:58,927
Must be Friday the 13th.

222
00:24:59,409 --> 00:25:02,025
Gee I, I wonder if she'll
wear her canteen uniform.

223
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:05,474
- If she does, you can count me out.
- Oh, she looks stunning in it.

224
00:25:05,644 --> 00:25:09,210
Who wants to be stunned?
I'm only going as a favor to you.

225
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,540
You and I don't like the same kind of girls.

226
00:25:12,438 --> 00:25:13,648
Hurry up, will you?

227
00:25:14,025 --> 00:25:16,980
Oh, it's a waste of time to Polish these.

228
00:25:17,267 --> 00:25:20,429
She'll probably step all
over them the first dance anyway.

229
00:25:22,187 --> 00:25:23,644
It's safer to sit it out.

230
00:25:23,788 --> 00:25:26,729
Quiet little corner and a have
a chat about votes for women.

231
00:25:28,773 --> 00:25:29,944
- Hello there.
- Hello.

232
00:25:29,974 --> 00:25:31,597
Whose window are you warbling under tonight?

233
00:25:31,627 --> 00:25:33,952
Lady Randolph's Charity Ball.
Wash your neck, come along.

234
00:25:33,982 --> 00:25:35,722
Oh but I haven't had been invited.

235
00:25:35,752 --> 00:25:39,211
- That's all right, I'm on the committee.
- No, I don't think I'll go.

236
00:25:39,241 --> 00:25:40,903
A smart boy.

237
00:26:20,164 --> 00:26:22,494
I wonder where Helen is.
She should be here by this time.

238
00:26:26,672 --> 00:26:28,325
How do you do sir?

239
00:26:36,791 --> 00:26:39,576
- There's she is.
- Don't point, it's rude.

240
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:43,246
- Oh, Helen.
- Roy.

241
00:26:47,642 --> 00:26:49,030
- Hello.
- Hello old thing.

242
00:26:49,031 --> 00:26:51,638
You're frightfully late, I
was afraid you weren't coming.

243
00:26:51,668 --> 00:26:56,021
- Oh, Helen, this is Monte.
- How do you do?

244
00:26:56,417 --> 00:26:57,697
How do you do?

245
00:26:59,593 --> 00:27:01,144
Well, that's done at last.

246
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:04,663
You know, you two been
avoiding each other for weeks.

247
00:27:06,771 --> 00:27:10,946
- Helen, may I've this next dance?
- What? Oh, of course.

248
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:15,513
- Oh Roy, there you are.
- Good evening Lady Randolph.

249
00:27:15,543 --> 00:27:18,169
I must say, you take your duties on
my committee very lightly.

250
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:19,537
- I'm sorry.
- Where you've been?

251
00:27:19,567 --> 00:27:21,295
You've completely disarranged my program.

252
00:27:21,325 --> 00:27:24,028
There are no end of things to be done.
Helen dear, you don't mind, do you?

253
00:27:24,058 --> 00:27:26,409
- Come along Roy, come at once.
- I'm sorry, Helen.

254
00:27:26,439 --> 00:27:29,611
Monte, would you take
this next dance with Helen?

255
00:27:29,845 --> 00:27:33,013
Oh, how do you do Monte?
How do you do? Now come along.

256
00:27:36,132 --> 00:27:37,615
Well?

257
00:28:02,565 --> 00:28:06,690
Hello Roy, I, I really must go and find...

258
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:11,362
Jimmy Kerrigan, he has
something most important to tell me, I...

259
00:28:15,285 --> 00:28:19,932
- Who is this Jimmy Kerrigan?
- Kerrigan? I've never heard of him.

260
00:28:36,526 --> 00:28:38,310
What do you thinking of?

261
00:28:39,208 --> 00:28:41,421
If you must know, I was thinking of Monte.

262
00:28:42,761 --> 00:28:46,496
- Do you like him?
- Yes, I like him, he's a marvelous dancer.

263
00:28:48,500 --> 00:28:50,654
Oh, Monte does all those things well.

264
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,708
- Helen.
- What?

265
00:28:58,307 --> 00:28:59,452
May I?

266
00:29:19,079 --> 00:29:22,072
- Oh, Monte.
- Oh hello there.

267
00:29:22,241 --> 00:29:23,686
Come sit down.

268
00:29:26,913 --> 00:29:28,983
You having a better time
than you expected Monte?

269
00:29:29,013 --> 00:29:33,005
Marvelous, been dancing with a beautiful
brunette, name of Eleanor, she's perfect.

270
00:29:33,035 --> 00:29:37,795
Oh, Eleanor Madden, you
don't really think she's beautiful?

271
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:40,879
- Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty?
- Stop it, I'm not a cat.

272
00:29:40,909 --> 00:29:42,155
Yes, you are.

273
00:29:42,741 --> 00:29:45,877
Well, if I'm a kitty, I'm a thirsty kitty.

274
00:29:46,228 --> 00:29:48,610
Roy dear, will you please
get me a glass of punch?

275
00:29:48,640 --> 00:29:49,654
Why, of course I will.

276
00:29:49,684 --> 00:29:51,833
- No, I'll go Roy.
- No, I'm the committee.

277
00:29:52,453 --> 00:29:54,932
You stay here and look after this wallflower.

278
00:29:56,092 --> 00:29:59,611
- But really, I...
- Oh, if you'd rather not.

279
00:30:00,245 --> 00:30:02,897
Well, I, I didn't mean...

280
00:30:08,608 --> 00:30:11,162
Don't you like wallflowers?

281
00:30:28,007 --> 00:30:30,854
- I shouldn't have done that.
- Oh, you're not sorry Monte.

282
00:30:30,884 --> 00:30:35,295
- Awfully sorry, I had no right to.
- What if I'm glad?

283
00:30:36,222 --> 00:30:39,509
- But what about Roy?
- Isn't that my business?

284
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,853
- I suppose so but...
- Hush.

285
00:30:48,636 --> 00:30:51,191
- Compliments of the committee.
- Thanks awfully Roy.

286
00:30:51,221 --> 00:30:54,281
- Perhaps he isn't been properly charming?
- Me?

287
00:30:54,949 --> 00:30:57,991
- More than charming.
- Good for you Monte.

288
00:30:59,813 --> 00:31:01,277
Taste?

289
00:31:44,919 --> 00:31:47,359
- She loves me.
- She blisters you.

290
00:31:47,538 --> 00:31:49,653
- It's worth it.
- Is she worth it?

291
00:31:49,683 --> 00:31:51,703
Depends on who she is.

292
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:56,534
- Hello.
- Hello.

293
00:31:56,564 --> 00:32:00,308
Well, thank goodness Lady
Randolph lost sight of me for a minute.

294
00:32:00,338 --> 00:32:03,139
Roy, you've been neglecting me shamefully.

295
00:32:03,169 --> 00:32:06,475
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.
You see, it's this beastly committee.

296
00:32:06,849 --> 00:32:10,249
- Lady Randolph won't let me alone a minute.
- Oh Roy, there you are.

297
00:32:10,279 --> 00:32:13,047
- Yes, here I am.
- Do you mind? Where is that list?

298
00:32:13,291 --> 00:32:17,215
Would you mind finding Sir
John for me? It's about my Canteen Unit.

299
00:32:17,245 --> 00:32:20,157
I must've the queen's
signature, it's so important.

300
00:32:20,336 --> 00:32:23,818
My dear, why don't you get into
your uniform? You look so pretty in it.

301
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:26,397
And Monte,
shouldn't you dance with Mary Blunt?

302
00:32:26,427 --> 00:32:27,965
- Yes, why don't you?
- And Roy. Roy...

303
00:32:28,207 --> 00:32:31,980
when you found Sir John, I want you
to lead the Grand Dance for me.

304
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,272
And really, there are so many...

305
00:32:33,302 --> 00:32:36,929
- things you've got to do.
- Yes, I'm, I'm terribly sorry, back soon.

306
00:32:37,062 --> 00:32:40,094
- You see, those girls been looking for you.
- I know but Lady Randolph, I'm supposed...

307
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,282
So you really joined
Lady Lizzie's Canteen Unit?

308
00:32:46,312 --> 00:32:48,289
Rather, chance of a lifetime.

309
00:32:48,390 --> 00:32:51,056
- We go to France in two weeks.
- Two weeks?

310
00:32:51,606 --> 00:32:53,788
Oh Roy said you're sailing the 15th.

311
00:32:56,487 --> 00:32:57,503
Is that so?

312
00:33:05,633 --> 00:33:08,781
- Bored?
- Tired, take me home, Monte.

313
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:11,105
- Home?
- It's not far.

314
00:33:11,135 --> 00:33:13,654
I've taken a flat in town,
near Canteen Headquarters.

315
00:33:13,946 --> 00:33:15,428
But, I mean...

316
00:33:16,491 --> 00:33:20,389
- Roy will be quite upset to find you gone.
- That's what he gets for being on committee.

317
00:33:21,527 --> 00:33:24,254
- But, really...
- Very well, I'll find someone else.

318
00:33:25,566 --> 00:33:29,431
- Oh, I didn't mean to be rude.
- Well, come on then.

319
00:33:43,626 --> 00:33:46,683
- Are we here?
- Well, it's number 27.

320
00:33:47,849 --> 00:33:49,706
Want to come up for a cigarette and a drink?

321
00:33:50,151 --> 00:33:52,508
- Oh really, you must be awfully tired.
- No, I'm not.

322
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,932
Come see my room, I've only had
a place of my own for a week.

323
00:33:56,507 --> 00:33:57,506
It's a new toy.

324
00:33:59,672 --> 00:34:00,963
What a baby you are.

325
00:34:02,529 --> 00:34:04,628
- Alley-oop.
- Alright.

326
00:34:14,644 --> 00:34:16,019
Well, this is jolly.

327
00:34:16,878 --> 00:34:19,210
- Sit down and I'll get you a drink.
- Thanks.

328
00:34:27,340 --> 00:34:30,580
- Say when.
- Whoa. When, when.

329
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:57,782
Would you be shocked if I put
on something more comfortable?

330
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,956
I'll try to survive.

331
00:35:55,152 --> 00:35:59,512
- Well, are you more comfortable now?
- Yes, are you?

332
00:36:01,712 --> 00:36:02,974
Oh, yes.

333
00:36:05,279 --> 00:36:07,166
You know, it seems
strange being here like this...

334
00:36:07,196 --> 00:36:09,404
after hearing Roy rave about you for months.

335
00:36:09,639 --> 00:36:12,281
- Does Roy rave?
- Oh rather, he idolizes you.

336
00:36:12,311 --> 00:36:15,470
Oh, I do wish he
wouldn't, it makes me feel guilty.

337
00:36:16,031 --> 00:36:18,972
- I can understand his raving now.
- Oh, don't be silly.

338
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:25,688
- You're not a bit like Roy, are you?
- I should say not.

339
00:36:26,443 --> 00:36:29,892
Roy is frightfully high
minded, he doesn't approve of me.

340
00:36:30,439 --> 00:36:33,237
He wouldn't approve of me
either if he knew what I'm really like.

341
00:36:34,265 --> 00:36:36,426
- Doesn't he know?
- No.

342
00:36:37,128 --> 00:36:39,874
When I'm with Roy,
I'm the way Roy wants me to be.

343
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:43,739
That's caddish,
isn't it? But I can't help it.

344
00:36:43,921 --> 00:36:46,381
- I understand.
- Roy wouldn't.

345
00:36:48,919 --> 00:36:51,955
- May I ask you a very personal question?
- Yes.

346
00:36:53,071 --> 00:36:54,541
Do you love Roy?

347
00:36:56,494 --> 00:37:00,645
No, not really. Not the way
Roy wants me to love him, I can't.

348
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:05,631
Roy's love means marriage and
children and never anyone but Roy.

349
00:37:05,774 --> 00:37:10,290
I couldn't bear that, I want to
be free, I want to be gay and have fun.

350
00:37:10,576 --> 00:37:13,465
Life is short and I
want to live while I'm alive.

351
00:37:14,207 --> 00:37:18,398
I know that, that's the way I feel too.

352
00:37:21,262 --> 00:37:22,563
I...

353
00:37:26,481 --> 00:37:28,355
I think I'd better go.

354
00:37:29,084 --> 00:37:30,893
- Must you?
- I really should.

355
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:34,160
Pull.

356
00:38:34,796 --> 00:38:36,735
Cold in here now, isn't it?

357
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,531
Have you a match?

358
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,857
Why so gloomy?

359
00:39:09,793 --> 00:39:13,216
- God, I'm rotten.
- I can't see it.

360
00:39:15,246 --> 00:39:18,513
Can't you? Well, then you're rotten too.

361
00:39:19,541 --> 00:39:21,728
- What do you mean?
- And Roy worships you.

362
00:39:22,222 --> 00:39:23,550
- You.
- Well?

363
00:39:23,993 --> 00:39:27,077
Don't you make yourself sick, you and Roy.

364
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,602
- God, that's funny.
- Get out of here.

365
00:39:29,632 --> 00:39:31,971
Don't worry, I can't get out fast enough.

366
00:39:32,712 --> 00:39:36,122
Get out and stay out.

367
00:39:53,939 --> 00:39:55,345
Where you've been?

368
00:39:59,249 --> 00:40:03,388
I stopped at a
at a bar after I took Helen home.

369
00:40:05,498 --> 00:40:09,298
- How you like her?
- Oh, she's all right.

370
00:40:10,496 --> 00:40:14,505
- Pass in a crowd, eh?
- I daresay she would.

371
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,201
Just what do you mean by that?

372
00:40:20,843 --> 00:40:23,316
Listen Roy, let me tell
you something, even if it hurts.

373
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:24,865
Yes?

374
00:40:25,138 --> 00:40:27,898
I wouldn't be so idealistic
about Helen if I were you.

375
00:40:28,119 --> 00:40:29,291
And why not?

376
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:34,067
Well I, I just wouldn't, that's all.

377
00:40:34,097 --> 00:40:37,243
- Well, why not?
- Oh, I don't know, forget it.

378
00:40:37,273 --> 00:40:39,762
Never mind crawling, out with it.

379
00:40:40,061 --> 00:40:42,469
Listen Roy, I tell you,
women are all the same.

380
00:40:42,755 --> 00:40:45,084
You look at every woman as a barmaid.

381
00:40:45,397 --> 00:40:47,402
You don't know anything about decent women.

382
00:40:47,649 --> 00:40:51,176
- Oh, all right, you know it all then.
- No, you've said enough, shut up.

383
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:01,101
Karl. Karl.

384
00:44:08,436 --> 00:44:09,621
Zep overhead.

385
00:44:13,135 --> 00:44:14,736
- South by east.
- Right-O.

386
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:26,382
Yes sir, yes sir, right.

387
00:44:27,875 --> 00:44:30,262
All lights out sir, lights out quick.

388
00:44:41,203 --> 00:44:44,766
Zeppelin overhead,
Zeppelin overhead, everybody out.

389
00:44:44,796 --> 00:44:46,887
- Hey, come on Monte.
- Zeppelin overhead.

390
00:44:47,555 --> 00:44:48,922
Come on Monte, what's the
matter with you? Get up.

391
00:44:48,952 --> 00:44:51,746
- We don't all have to go, I'm tired.
- Oh, shut up.

392
00:44:52,579 --> 00:44:55,117
- Let's go, hurry up, come on.
- Be right with you Elliot.

393
00:44:55,147 --> 00:44:56,048
- Come on Monte, get up.
- Alright.

394
00:44:56,078 --> 00:44:57,961
Alright, let's go, hurry.

395
00:45:38,639 --> 00:45:39,472
Karl...

396
00:46:24,212 --> 00:46:24,642
Karl.

397
00:46:40,741 --> 00:46:41,679
Danke.

398
00:47:04,057 --> 00:47:05,749
- Well, so long there Tommy.
- Good luck Elliot.

399
00:47:05,753 --> 00:47:06,680
Alright old chap.

400
00:47:08,532 --> 00:47:09,839
- Go get them Monte.
- Goodbye.

401
00:47:10,105 --> 00:47:11,698
- Good luck Roy.
- Right.

402
00:49:43,640 --> 00:49:44,366
Perfect.

403
00:51:13,297 --> 00:51:15,876
Look Roy, there she goes.

404
00:51:29,052 --> 00:51:29,879
Let's go.

405
00:53:30,102 --> 00:53:30,822
Kapitan?

406
00:53:45,107 --> 00:53:48,325
Kapitan, Kapitan.

407
00:53:56,712 --> 00:53:59,944
Kapitan. Kapitan.

408
00:56:23,176 --> 00:56:24,316
Jawohl.

409
00:58:59,074 --> 00:59:00,734
Hey Roy, they hit our motor.

410
00:59:02,493 --> 00:59:04,212
Cut the gas, we'll burn to death.

411
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:11,975
- Roy.
- Oh, shut up.

412
00:59:53,175 --> 00:59:54,648
Well, this is a mess, all right.

413
00:59:54,678 --> 00:59:57,467
- Yeah, just our luck.
- Lucky we weren't both killed.

414
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,846
Well, we're through.

415
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:03,324
Herr Kapitan.

416
01:01:04,861 --> 01:01:06,914
- Look at it Monte.
- Roy, it's falling.

417
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,110
- Look at that Roy.
- Great, isn't it?

418
01:01:26,681 --> 01:01:28,027
They're done for.

419
01:01:41,543 --> 01:01:43,229
Look out, run.

420
01:06:07,307 --> 01:06:08,999
Just a minute.

421
01:06:12,208 --> 01:06:14,615
Why the blazes don't you
look where you're going sir?

422
01:06:14,645 --> 01:06:15,839
I'm sorry sir.

423
01:06:16,775 --> 01:06:19,730
Isn't it customary to
salute one's superior officer?

424
01:06:21,187 --> 01:06:24,285
- Thank you, what is your name sir?
- Lieutenant Roy Rutledge.

425
01:06:24,923 --> 01:06:26,470
- Make a note of that.
- Yes sir.

426
01:06:31,691 --> 01:06:34,515
Would you like to try it and find out?

427
01:06:38,250 --> 01:06:40,736
They are, they glisten in the sun.

428
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,129
What the hell you trying to do?
Took me three hours to write that.

429
01:06:49,130 --> 01:06:51,278
- You're nothing but a pest anyhow.
- Shut up and get out.

430
01:06:51,851 --> 01:06:53,070
Have a little fun.

431
01:06:53,426 --> 01:06:56,875
- You shouldn't smoke so many.
- What difference is it make?

432
01:06:56,905 --> 01:06:59,972
- You know it's bad for you.
- Buy a chocolate Miss.

433
01:07:03,201 --> 01:07:06,246
- Change Miss.
- Please.

434
01:07:07,647 --> 01:07:10,736
- That's a good boy.
- What a life it would be married to you.

435
01:07:10,945 --> 01:07:13,171
- Oh, you don't fancy it?
- Beastly, no smokes.

436
01:07:13,522 --> 01:07:16,385
- Think of all the money we'd save.
- What would we spend it on?

437
01:07:17,127 --> 01:07:20,030
- Oh, a diamond dog collar.
- For me?

438
01:07:20,060 --> 01:07:22,046
No, I'd buy a muzzle for you.

439
01:07:22,463 --> 01:07:24,701
You wouldn't spoil my
beautiful mustache, would you?

440
01:07:24,857 --> 01:07:28,566
No, we keep that in the parlor under glass.

441
01:07:33,083 --> 01:07:35,642
- Hello Helen.
- Oh hello Roy.

442
01:07:37,001 --> 01:07:40,137
Roy, I'd like you to meet
Captain Redfield. Lieutenant Rutledge.

443
01:07:40,371 --> 01:07:43,117
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

444
01:07:44,145 --> 01:07:45,981
- Beastly weather.
- Yes, isn't it.

445
01:07:46,410 --> 01:07:48,857
- You'll get used to it.
- Thanks.

446
01:07:50,263 --> 01:07:53,321
Gee, it's great to see you again
Helen, it's been four whole days.

447
01:07:54,141 --> 01:07:55,274
Really?

448
01:07:56,770 --> 01:07:59,756
- Have you been over long?
- Three weeks.

449
01:07:59,840 --> 01:08:03,434
Oh. Three weeks.

450
01:08:05,946 --> 01:08:08,058
- Everything all right up your way?
- Oh, yes.

451
01:08:08,614 --> 01:08:11,314
- Your squadron near here?
- Twenty miles up the line.

452
01:08:11,397 --> 01:08:14,093
Twenty miles, that far.

453
01:08:15,381 --> 01:08:18,830
- You chaps have it rather soft, haven't you?
- Do you think so?

454
01:08:18,860 --> 01:08:21,655
Well, I mean to say being able to
dash about the countryside and all that.

455
01:08:23,190 --> 01:08:25,529
- Wish I'd picked the RFC.
- Well, why didn't you?

456
01:08:25,559 --> 01:08:26,626
Roy.

457
01:08:28,709 --> 01:08:31,131
- Well, I be going.
- Oh, don't go.

458
01:08:33,801 --> 01:08:34,839
I think I'd better.

459
01:08:37,305 --> 01:08:40,019
Goodbye Helen and don't forget your promise.

460
01:08:40,049 --> 01:08:41,022
I won't.

461
01:08:46,316 --> 01:08:47,490
Who's that bag of wind?

462
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,723
Would you mind
not talking about my friends like that?

463
01:08:49,753 --> 01:08:52,396
- Oh now, Helen please.
- Oh, you were perfectly beastly to him.

464
01:08:52,426 --> 01:08:56,698
Oh, I'm terribly sorry,
guess my nerves are a bit raw.

465
01:08:57,431 --> 01:09:01,271
- Things haven't been so easy this last week.
- Oh, you've been fighting?

466
01:09:03,005 --> 01:09:06,634
- Did you shoot down any Boche?
- Yes, I managed to get a couple.

467
01:09:06,664 --> 01:09:08,637
Really? How thrilling, tell me about it.

468
01:09:08,667 --> 01:09:12,181
- Oh, it's really nothing much to tell.
- Three bars of chocolate Miss.

469
01:10:18,521 --> 01:10:20,458
- Oh, Jymes.
- Oh, Jymes.

470
01:10:20,488 --> 01:10:24,529
- Bread Jymes, we want bread.
- We want bread.

471
01:10:25,070 --> 01:10:27,246
Coming sirs, coming.

472
01:10:28,653 --> 01:10:30,735
Did you ever try hurrying Jymes?

473
01:10:30,871 --> 01:10:34,307
Sorry sir but I stopped to dig
a few of the cockroaches out of it sir.

474
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:36,560
Well, put it down.

475
01:10:41,901 --> 01:10:45,566
- Well, where is the bread?
- Did you ever try hurrying sir?

476
01:10:47,388 --> 01:10:50,116
Jymes, more bread.

477
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:52,866
- Drown the cockroaches this time.
- Yes sir.

478
01:10:55,999 --> 01:10:59,945
- Jymes, what's the taste in this soup?
- I can't say sir.

479
01:10:59,975 --> 01:11:02,819
- It's not soup, it's soap.
- Say, I think it's shoe Polish.

480
01:11:02,849 --> 01:11:03,549
Right.

481
01:11:03,579 --> 01:11:06,879
Sorry sir, cook said the
soup was a bit weak tonight.

482
01:11:07,025 --> 01:11:09,836
Maybe you taste
the disinfectant in the water sir.

483
01:11:14,175 --> 01:11:17,208
Well, strike me blind, it's a hair.

484
01:11:17,365 --> 01:11:19,739
Wash it off and wear it Baldy.

485
01:11:27,715 --> 01:11:31,360
- Hello, you chaps.
- Hello Monte, how goes it?

486
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:40,083
- Still no news of Harry?
- No.

487
01:11:40,167 --> 01:11:42,835
Somebody always gets it on the night patrol.

488
01:11:42,979 --> 01:11:46,580
What do you think Marryat? You saw it happen,
is there any chance he got down alive?

489
01:11:48,372 --> 01:11:50,860
No, I don't think
so, the searchlights got him.

490
01:11:51,069 --> 01:11:54,370
We were flying low and they heard us,
we started to climb but it was too late.

491
01:11:54,703 --> 01:11:58,815
Shrapnel began bursting all around him, two
bursts caught him and he started to drop.

492
01:11:59,325 --> 01:12:03,949
It was awful to see him down there, twisting
and diving, crippled, always dropping.

493
01:12:04,229 --> 01:12:08,009
Trying every way to get clear of
those lights, then another burst got him.

494
01:12:08,134 --> 01:12:11,300
- We could hear him screaming...
- Stop, I can't stand it.

495
01:12:11,476 --> 01:12:14,454
Good thing he took your place
Rutledge, you might've got it instead of him.

496
01:12:14,484 --> 01:12:18,639
Oh, I'll get it sooner or later, we'll
all get it. Isn't there any end to this?

497
01:12:18,669 --> 01:12:21,076
- Oh, shut up, you're always whining.
- Shut up yourself.

498
01:12:21,106 --> 01:12:23,283
- Who'll make me?
- I'll make you.

499
01:12:27,916 --> 01:12:31,540
- Sit down Jack and be quiet.
- Alright, what's the matter with you fellas?

500
01:12:32,435 --> 01:12:35,601
Would anybody like to take
Monte's place on tonight's patrol?

501
01:12:36,516 --> 01:12:37,328
Lay off.

502
01:12:37,358 --> 01:12:39,192
- No more soup.
- We need some.

503
01:12:39,222 --> 01:12:41,576
- No more soup.
- We need some soup.

504
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,856
Jymes. Hurry it up.

505
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,465
Splendid.

506
01:12:51,115 --> 01:12:53,125
Splendid, Jymes.

507
01:12:54,843 --> 01:12:58,612
- Splendid.
- That's what comes from hurrying.

508
01:13:00,434 --> 01:13:03,224
What was dinner before you dropped it Jymes?

509
01:13:03,870 --> 01:13:07,347
- A tasty bit of salmon sir.
- Sewer trout again?

510
01:13:07,503 --> 01:13:09,284
Hasn't the cook anything else?

511
01:13:09,877 --> 01:13:13,036
- Well sir, it's that tin of pork and beans.
- No, we don't want it.

512
01:13:13,066 --> 01:13:14,706
Can he do anything with the garbage?

513
01:13:14,736 --> 01:13:18,142
Oh well, never mind,
we aren't hungry, are we?

514
01:13:19,321 --> 01:13:21,260
- Coffee Jymes.
- Yes sir.

515
01:13:21,290 --> 01:13:22,470
- And Jymes.
- Yes sir?

516
01:13:22,500 --> 01:13:25,334
- Don't let anything hurry you.
- No sir.

517
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:30,878
Drinking again?

518
01:13:36,449 --> 01:13:38,115
- You dirty louse.
- Hey Baldy.

519
01:13:38,961 --> 01:13:42,449
- The sooner you get shot down, the better.
- Oh, Baldy darling.

520
01:13:45,000 --> 01:13:47,581
- Now that didn't hurt Baldy.
- Baldy...

521
01:13:53,967 --> 01:13:54,982
Attention.

522
01:13:57,678 --> 01:13:58,573
As you were.

523
01:14:03,363 --> 01:14:05,914
Following officers
will report for night patrol.

524
01:14:06,473 --> 01:14:07,892
- Drayton.
- Yes sir.

525
01:14:08,348 --> 01:14:10,069
- Fuller.
- Here sir.

526
01:14:10,418 --> 01:14:11,303
Maloney.

527
01:14:11,576 --> 01:14:16,378
Oh no, not an old bald headed man
like me up there in the cold, cold air.

528
01:14:18,057 --> 01:14:20,074
Perhaps Fritz will warm it up for you.

529
01:14:20,867 --> 01:14:22,117
- Neville.
- Here sir.

530
01:14:22,728 --> 01:14:23,770
Monte Rutledge.

531
01:14:26,113 --> 01:14:27,466
Monte Rutledge.

532
01:14:32,399 --> 01:14:36,551
- I don't feel very well tonight sir.
- That's all right boy, none of us feel well.

533
01:14:37,032 --> 01:14:40,586
- But you don't understand.
- I think I do Rutledge.

534
01:14:41,150 --> 01:14:45,856
But I say sir, you don't understand, there
seems to be something the matter with me.

535
01:14:45,886 --> 01:14:47,756
I know what's the
matter with him, he's yellow.

536
01:14:47,786 --> 01:14:49,418
- Oh, shut up.
- Oh, let's say it.

537
01:14:49,448 --> 01:14:51,856
Didn't Harry go west last night
because he took this man's place?

538
01:14:51,886 --> 01:14:53,379
- Keep quiet Jack.
- I'll not keep quiet.

539
01:14:53,409 --> 01:14:56,581
- He's yellow and we all know it.
- That's a lie, I'm not yellow.

540
01:14:57,377 --> 01:15:00,526
I can see things as they are, that's all.
And I'm sick of this rotten business.

541
01:15:01,255 --> 01:15:03,611
You fools, why do you
let them kill you like this?

542
01:15:03,641 --> 01:15:08,714
What are you fighting for?
Patriotism, duty, are you mad?

543
01:15:08,979 --> 01:15:10,504
Can't you see they're just words?

544
01:15:10,534 --> 01:15:14,044
Words coined by politicians and profiteers
to trick you into fighting for them.

545
01:15:14,798 --> 01:15:17,688
What's a word compared
with life, the only life you've got.

546
01:15:18,377 --> 01:15:22,737
I'll give them a word, murder. That's
what this dirty rotten politician's war is.

547
01:15:22,767 --> 01:15:26,251
Murder, you know it
as well as I do. Yellow, am I?

548
01:15:26,421 --> 01:15:29,388
You're the ones that are yellow.
I've got guts to say what I think.

549
01:15:29,418 --> 01:15:34,061
You're afraid to say it, so afraid to be
called yellow, you'd rather be killed first.

550
01:15:34,426 --> 01:15:37,862
You fools, you poor, stupid fools.

551
01:15:37,892 --> 01:15:41,688
Oh Monte now, pull
yourself together, will you?

552
01:15:42,313 --> 01:15:43,563
Stand up Rutledge.

553
01:15:45,243 --> 01:15:49,061
I've taken a lot of shirking from you since
we came out here but this is a bit too much.

554
01:15:49,062 --> 01:15:51,110
Sir, he really is ill.
You're a disgrace to your squadron.

555
01:15:51,140 --> 01:15:52,348
- Go to your quarters.
- Yes sir.

556
01:16:14,098 --> 01:16:15,160
Have a cigarette.

557
01:16:17,462 --> 01:16:19,003
You don't think I'm yellow, do you Roy?

558
01:16:19,430 --> 01:16:22,866
Why, of course not, you're just
more sensitive than the rest of us.

559
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:25,740
- I wonder.
- Stop thinking about it.

560
01:16:26,042 --> 01:16:27,416
I wish I could.

561
01:16:28,905 --> 01:16:31,737
Haven't I been up twice on the
night patrol? I'm trying to do my share.

562
01:16:31,767 --> 01:16:33,112
Of course you are now.

563
01:16:33,913 --> 01:16:37,162
You, you must be pretty well
fed up with me after all this.

564
01:16:37,192 --> 01:16:41,232
- Oh, that's rot.
- I'm not yellow.

565
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,044
I'm not.

566
01:16:43,074 --> 01:16:45,168
Oh now Monte,
come on, pull yourself together.

567
01:16:49,354 --> 01:16:51,735
Staff Colonel, everybody out.

568
01:16:52,687 --> 01:16:53,551
Come on Monte.

569
01:16:56,128 --> 01:16:57,127
Stand easy.

570
01:17:02,527 --> 01:17:06,077
Well men, I don't like
what I have to say but let's face it,

571
01:17:07,712 --> 01:17:10,232
You all know the
central munitions dump at Spraug.

572
01:17:10,825 --> 01:17:13,740
You've tried three times
to bomb that depot without success.

573
01:17:14,375 --> 01:17:17,176
No fault of yours, of course,
they've guarded it too closely.

574
01:17:18,743 --> 01:17:22,158
That munitions depot at Spraug
must be destroyed tomorrow morning.

575
01:17:23,376 --> 01:17:28,093
Now, then, today a German bombing
plane was forced down within our lines.

576
01:17:28,645 --> 01:17:31,384
We were lucky enough to capture it
before they had a chance to destroy it.

577
01:17:32,050 --> 01:17:33,904
We fixed it up so it'll fly.

578
01:17:34,706 --> 01:17:37,600
And we want to use this plane
to bomb the Spraug depot.

579
01:17:38,745 --> 01:17:41,067
There's no question that
the venture will succeed this time.

580
01:17:41,630 --> 01:17:45,076
The enemy won't suspect one of their
own planes until after the depot is bombed.

581
01:17:45,649 --> 01:17:47,724
Then, when they discover the trick...

582
01:17:48,470 --> 01:17:51,531
well, you you may have
a little difficulty in getting back.

583
01:17:54,134 --> 01:17:56,581
I need two men to fly this plane.

584
01:17:59,569 --> 01:18:01,787
- I'll go sir.
- Are you sure you want to go?

585
01:18:01,817 --> 01:18:03,339
- Quite sure sir.
- Very well.

586
01:18:03,369 --> 01:18:04,536
I'll go with him sir.

587
01:18:06,597 --> 01:18:09,502
- Who are these men?
- Lieutenants Monte and Roy Rutledge sir.

588
01:18:10,346 --> 01:18:11,908
- Brothers, eh?
- Dismissed.

589
01:18:15,234 --> 01:18:16,380
Now, young men,

590
01:18:19,660 --> 01:18:21,929
I want you to realize how important this is.

591
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:25,168
The Seventh Brigade is
been ordered to go over the...

592
01:18:25,198 --> 01:18:27,605
top in a surprise attack
tomorrow evening at dusk.

593
01:18:28,725 --> 01:18:32,109
The brigade doesn't know it but I, I'm
afraid they're going to be slaughtered.

594
01:18:32,432 --> 01:18:34,098
There's too much artillery in front of us.

595
01:18:35,149 --> 01:18:37,836
If you destroy that munitions
depot early tomorrow morning...

596
01:18:38,117 --> 01:18:40,939
it will weaken the enemy artillery,
and we may be able to get through.

597
01:18:42,115 --> 01:18:44,292
Hundreds of lives depend on you.

598
01:18:44,956 --> 01:18:46,804
- You understand?
- Yes sir.

599
01:18:46,986 --> 01:18:48,054
Now, another thing.

600
01:18:48,431 --> 01:18:51,880
The plane you are to fly is far too
dangerous a piece of armament...

601
01:18:51,910 --> 01:18:53,546
to let the enemy recapture it.

602
01:18:53,806 --> 01:18:56,188
It must return or be destroyed.

603
01:18:56,956 --> 01:18:59,299
If you were captured,
you'd be shot as spies anyway.

604
01:18:59,481 --> 01:19:02,279
- Baldy.
- Oh, Baldy?

605
01:19:02,651 --> 01:19:06,074
You'll take the morning patrol in
towards Spraug as far as you can.

606
01:19:06,104 --> 01:19:08,287
You might possibly help
them get back, by all means.

607
01:19:08,317 --> 01:19:09,277
Yes sir.

608
01:19:10,292 --> 01:19:13,273
You'll get your maps and final
instructions just before taking off.

609
01:19:13,650 --> 01:19:17,568
Report to the field at 3 A. M.
Until then, let them do as they please.

610
01:19:18,048 --> 01:19:19,507
- 3 o'clock, you two.
- Yes sir.

611
01:19:19,537 --> 01:19:21,408
- Good luck.
- Thank you sir.

612
01:19:22,579 --> 01:19:23,672
Thank you sir.

613
01:19:30,954 --> 01:19:34,052
- What time is it, Monte?
- Ten past 9.

614
01:19:34,351 --> 01:19:37,449
Helen's canteen closes at 10,
we've just enough time to get there.

615
01:19:37,479 --> 01:19:39,094
You think they'll let us have the motorcycle?

616
01:19:39,124 --> 01:19:44,208
- Why, of course, we're it tonight.
- Yeah, we're it all right.

617
01:19:46,552 --> 01:19:48,908
- Not sorry, are you?
- Oh, let's not talk about it.

618
01:19:48,938 --> 01:19:51,225
I'm not even going to
think about it until 3 o'clock.

619
01:19:52,618 --> 01:19:54,856
What's your program? Wine, women and song?

620
01:19:54,886 --> 01:19:57,095
Oh, perhaps I'll do without the song tonight.

621
01:20:15,376 --> 01:20:16,625
See you at Grosson's?

622
01:20:16,655 --> 01:20:19,931
Either there or at Jacques across the
street, wherever you hear the most noise.

623
01:20:20,335 --> 01:20:22,053
Don't you want to come
in with me to see Helen?

624
01:20:22,083 --> 01:20:24,525
- Oh, I better not.
- Right-O.

625
01:20:30,955 --> 01:20:33,349
- Where's Helen?
- She's gone out.

626
01:20:35,510 --> 01:20:38,412
- Was she expecting you?
- No.

627
01:20:39,609 --> 01:20:41,093
Would you care to leave a note?

628
01:20:42,316 --> 01:20:45,244
- Yes, I think I will.
- Pen and ink on the table.

629
01:21:57,904 --> 01:22:00,416
- You'll see that she gets this?
- Oh, yes.

630
01:22:01,340 --> 01:22:05,724
- Thank you, good night.
- Good night.

631
01:22:24,363 --> 01:22:27,591
- Hello, what's up?
- She isn't in.

632
01:22:29,010 --> 01:22:32,198
That's tough, want to come along with me?

633
01:22:32,705 --> 01:22:34,228
- Where to?
- Grosson's.

634
01:22:35,308 --> 01:22:36,557
Right-O.

635
01:22:40,306 --> 01:22:41,946
Your switch on?

636
01:23:42,699 --> 01:23:44,066
Will you close it, will you?

637
01:23:59,377 --> 01:24:03,092
- Helen.
- Well, if it isn't old Roy.

638
01:24:03,868 --> 01:24:06,202
Old solemn Roy himself.

639
01:24:06,232 --> 01:24:11,306
Sit down Roy, Sit down the
floor and hang your legs over.

640
01:24:11,376 --> 01:24:15,269
- Take your hands off her.
- Oh, I can't take my hands off.

641
01:24:15,299 --> 01:24:17,338
You heard what I said,
take your hands off her.

642
01:24:17,368 --> 01:24:20,592
- Who asked you to this party anyway?
- Oh Helen, let me take you home.

643
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:25,017
Home? Who wants to go home?
I'm having a marvelous time.

644
01:24:25,329 --> 01:24:27,100
I was until you came in.

645
01:24:27,516 --> 01:24:31,056
I advise you to get out
before you're kicked out.

646
01:24:31,654 --> 01:24:34,087
Keep your, keep your
filthy hands off of my girl.

647
01:24:34,244 --> 01:24:38,890
Your girl? You fool, I wouldn't belong
to you if you were the last man on Earth.

648
01:24:39,046 --> 01:24:42,209
- You're nothing to me, nothing.
- Come on Roy, let's get out of here.

649
01:24:42,239 --> 01:24:45,652
Oh, let's have it out,
I don't love you, I never have.

650
01:24:46,432 --> 01:24:49,953
I never had any fun with you
anyway, you and your high ideals.

651
01:24:50,109 --> 01:24:54,014
You're too good to live, you're
just a stupid prig if you ask me.

652
01:24:54,044 --> 01:24:58,976
You make me sick, do you hear? Sick.
Now get out here, I hate the sight of you.

653
01:25:05,402 --> 01:25:08,279
Come on Roy, let's go across the street.

654
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:57,800
Sweet, sweet baby.
Handsome, big, strong baby. N'est-Ce pas?

655
01:26:00,625 --> 01:26:03,904
- N'est-Ce pas kiss Papa, eh?
- Oh baby.

656
01:26:13,418 --> 01:26:14,563
Hello Cheri.

657
01:26:21,044 --> 01:26:25,171
- Ah, don't take it so hard Roy, forget it.
- Is your friend sick?

658
01:26:26,758 --> 01:26:30,155
No, he'll be all right, drink up Roy.

659
01:26:36,675 --> 01:26:38,367
I still can't believe it.

660
01:26:40,098 --> 01:26:43,808
You just don't know anything
about women, they're all the same.

661
01:26:43,990 --> 01:26:46,991
I've been telling you that for
years, maybe you'll believe me now.

662
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:51,539
- Helen is not that sort.
- Oh, nonsense.

663
01:26:54,375 --> 01:26:57,746
- It's the war, she's changed.
- No, you're wrong Roy.

664
01:26:58,124 --> 01:26:59,894
War doesn't change people. It's...

665
01:27:00,337 --> 01:27:03,187
it's like getting drunk, it
brings out what people really are.

666
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,855
You can't make me believe
Helen was like that before.

667
01:27:05,885 --> 01:27:09,980
- Well, she was, I've known it all along.
- You too?

668
01:27:10,010 --> 01:27:14,015
Oh, I'm sorry Roy, don't
take it so hard. She isn't worth it.

669
01:27:14,848 --> 01:27:18,050
- I suppose you're right.
- Of course I'm right.

670
01:27:18,744 --> 01:27:23,147
Listen Roy, never love
a woman, just make love to her.

671
01:27:23,385 --> 01:27:26,054
You see, like this, look.

672
01:27:30,843 --> 01:27:32,450
Go ahead Roy, try it.

673
01:27:42,874 --> 01:27:44,157
That's the way.

674
01:27:52,943 --> 01:27:57,492
Oh. What you do baby?
All wet, no, no, no, no.

675
01:27:57,522 --> 01:28:01,605
Imbecile, Oh baby, voila.

676
01:28:02,385 --> 01:28:06,329
Hey listen Monte, Monte go
easy, we got to go up at 3 o'clock.

677
01:28:06,359 --> 01:28:09,062
Oh listen Roy, the hell
with this 3 o'clock business.

678
01:28:09,092 --> 01:28:11,769
- What you mean?
- Just that, to hell with it.

679
01:28:13,200 --> 01:28:16,108
Say, you're crazy Monte,
we can't get out of it now.

680
01:28:16,138 --> 01:28:17,670
Oh, why can't we?

681
01:28:18,268 --> 01:28:21,692
Listen Roy, all this idealistic
stuff won't get you anywhere.

682
01:28:21,938 --> 01:28:25,426
You tried it on Helen and what
happened? You got a kick in the face.

683
01:28:25,986 --> 01:28:28,420
You can't go through life
thinking the way you do.

684
01:28:28,602 --> 01:28:32,012
The people take advantage of you
and make a fool of you the way she did.

685
01:28:37,218 --> 01:28:38,766
It's beginning to
look as though you're right.

686
01:28:38,796 --> 01:28:40,185
Of course I'm right.

687
01:28:40,729 --> 01:28:44,813
I was right about Helen and now I'm
right about this 3 o'clock business too.

688
01:28:46,167 --> 01:28:49,547
- This is another thing entirely Monte.
- Why is it?

689
01:28:49,577 --> 01:28:52,855
They're just taking advantage
of you in another way, that's all.

690
01:28:53,043 --> 01:28:55,497
It's chaps like you that are meat for them.

691
01:28:55,527 --> 01:28:59,063
All they got to do is make it
sound heroic and you fall for it.

692
01:28:59,856 --> 01:29:04,178
Hey listen Roy, what's
the difference if we don't go?

693
01:29:06,664 --> 01:29:10,621
- But we can't get out of it now.
- Why can't we?

694
01:29:11,050 --> 01:29:14,616
Listen, tell them, tell
them the motorcycle broke down.

695
01:29:14,980 --> 01:29:18,624
Tell them anything, what do you say Roy?

696
01:29:22,047 --> 01:29:23,101
Well...

697
01:29:31,690 --> 01:29:34,983
- Come on, old ooh-la-la.
- Oh, no, no, no, Cheri.

698
01:29:37,261 --> 01:29:38,614
Oh baby.

699
01:29:41,738 --> 01:29:44,198
- N'est-Ce pas?
- Oh, oui, oui madam.

700
01:29:44,228 --> 01:29:45,500
Oh baby.

701
01:29:49,287 --> 01:29:54,420
Oh, stop looking at your watch
Roy, you're not going anywhere.

702
01:30:00,310 --> 01:30:03,902
- Yes I am and so are you.
- Who said I am?

703
01:30:04,358 --> 01:30:08,093
Listen Monte, we're a little drunk
and we've been talking wildly.

704
01:30:08,484 --> 01:30:10,970
It's no way out of this
and we know it, come on Monte.

705
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:15,616
No, no, let me alone. Come on, old ooh-la-la.

706
01:30:16,833 --> 01:30:18,083
Monte.

707
01:30:18,525 --> 01:30:21,570
Why, they'd court-martial us
in a minute if we didn't show up.

708
01:30:22,202 --> 01:30:25,266
Why, that's desertion
Monte, they shoot people for that.

709
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,018
Come on, let's get out of here, come on.

710
01:30:29,411 --> 01:30:31,897
- Come on.
- I suppose you're right.

711
01:30:32,145 --> 01:30:36,153
- Oh, no, no, no, no Monte.
- What a pair of fools we are.

712
01:30:49,955 --> 01:30:51,335
Let's go.

713
01:30:59,639 --> 01:31:01,487
- Easy, now.
- Easy.

714
01:31:05,730 --> 01:31:07,969
Look out for the firing pin.

715
01:31:11,730 --> 01:31:14,111
Right-O, I got it.

716
01:31:23,313 --> 01:31:25,070
- Contactor.
- Contact.

717
01:31:31,122 --> 01:31:35,162
Just for altitude and ground speed
here, keep this site trained on the target.

718
01:31:35,242 --> 01:31:39,061
Then pull the release when you
hit the stop, you understand?

719
01:31:39,091 --> 01:31:43,486
- Don't forget the leveler, goodbye.
- Goodbye.

720
01:31:51,821 --> 01:31:53,799
- Contactor.
- Contact.

721
01:32:01,491 --> 01:32:04,862
Remember this ship
weighs 20,000 pounds, good luck.

722
01:32:05,135 --> 01:32:06,541
Thank you.

723
01:37:07,838 --> 01:37:09,882
Roy, the depot.

724
01:40:19,150 --> 01:40:21,675
Roy, look there.

725
01:41:00,016 --> 01:41:03,049
They've seen us, they coming on us.

726
01:41:14,001 --> 01:41:16,539
For Christ's sake.

727
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,034
Hey Roy, look. They hit our right motor.

728
01:43:09,641 --> 01:43:11,620
I got him.

729
01:43:36,276 --> 01:43:42,016
Roy, look over there.
It's our squadrons, they coming.

730
01:46:39,849 --> 01:46:42,257
Roy, they've gone.

731
01:46:59,228 --> 01:47:01,155
Jesus.

732
01:47:31,447 --> 01:47:33,737
Son of a Boche.

733
01:47:47,875 --> 01:47:49,918
Hey.

734
01:47:51,062 --> 01:47:54,944
It's me. Hey, it's me, god damn it.

735
01:47:55,370 --> 01:48:01,253
- It's old Baldy. Hey. Baldy.
- Hello, it's Baldy, look Roy.

736
01:48:01,978 --> 01:48:03,510
It's Baldy.

737
01:48:06,380 --> 01:48:09,699
You see that guy?

738
01:48:10,923 --> 01:48:13,305
Look at old good Baldy.

739
01:48:44,998 --> 01:48:49,266
Good boy, see that? He's got him.

740
01:48:56,961 --> 01:48:59,841
Hey look, he's got him, he's got him.

741
01:49:15,753 --> 01:49:18,707
They've changed around.

742
01:50:04,690 --> 01:50:07,137
Our strut is gone, that son of a bitch.

743
01:50:17,978 --> 01:50:23,549
Roy, he got us. Roy,
go down, go down, go down.

744
01:51:12,147 --> 01:51:15,256
One more for Baldy.

745
01:52:03,459 --> 01:52:06,343
No more control?

746
01:52:09,130 --> 01:52:11,666
Pull her up.

747
01:52:22,027 --> 01:52:26,205
Oh, my God, we're on fire, we're burning.

748
01:52:28,847 --> 01:52:31,749
Roy, get down.

749
01:52:54,240 --> 01:52:57,220
Do something Roy.

750
01:55:09,487 --> 01:55:13,490
Ah so, we meet again.

751
01:55:17,830 --> 01:55:21,460
It was you who bombed
the depot at Spraug, nicht wahr?

752
01:55:22,465 --> 01:55:23,337
Yes.

753
01:55:23,367 --> 01:55:26,634
And you were flying
a German plane, nicht wahr?

754
01:55:27,671 --> 01:55:29,831
- Yes.
- Very clever.

755
01:55:30,352 --> 01:55:34,317
It is a pity you must take
your congratulations from me.

756
01:55:35,798 --> 01:55:38,482
There are a few questions I must ask you...

757
01:55:38,725 --> 01:55:42,052
if you answer them
simply, it will be easy for you.

758
01:55:43,347 --> 01:55:47,503
To what squadron of the
Royal Flying Corp are you attached?

759
01:55:52,060 --> 01:55:56,303
Just why were you sent to bomb
that munitions depot this morning?

760
01:55:57,475 --> 01:55:59,047
Was our natural target.

761
01:55:59,921 --> 01:56:04,659
But possibly it was to clear the
way for a little surprise attack, eh?

762
01:56:08,369 --> 01:56:11,076
You are surprised.

763
01:56:11,727 --> 01:56:15,410
We know all about it,
so you need not be afraid to talk.

764
01:56:16,660 --> 01:56:20,044
Now please, when and
where is the attack to be made?

765
01:56:26,298 --> 01:56:29,948
Oh, you are stupid
not to tell, it is nothing.

766
01:56:30,195 --> 01:56:33,943
For you the war is
over, nicht wahr? We are friends.

767
01:56:39,267 --> 01:56:43,167
Listen, if you tell me, I will see
that you are sent to a special camp...

768
01:56:43,197 --> 01:56:45,917
reserved only for certain prisoners of war.

769
01:56:46,424 --> 01:56:49,691
It's near Munich, far away from all this.

770
01:56:50,082 --> 01:56:52,984
You will have every comfort.

771
01:56:53,974 --> 01:56:56,447
And in a few months
from now, when the war is over...

772
01:56:56,707 --> 01:57:02,499
you will be alive and in good health, which
is more than most of us will be able to say.

773
01:57:03,007 --> 01:57:06,287
So, you see? It can be easy for you.

774
01:57:07,276 --> 01:57:08,526
Now please.

775
01:57:15,469 --> 01:57:19,055
So, you will not tell?

776
01:57:21,311 --> 01:57:24,248
Possibly you do not
know that flying a German...

777
01:57:24,278 --> 01:57:27,137
plane is the same
as wearing a German uniform.

778
01:57:27,983 --> 01:57:31,302
Any disguised soldier is a spy, nicht wahr?

779
01:57:32,369 --> 01:57:34,841
And you know what happens to spies?

780
01:57:36,807 --> 01:57:39,501
I think you two friends
had better talk it over.

781
01:57:41,128 --> 01:57:43,003
I will give you 15 minutes.

782
01:57:43,913 --> 01:57:47,232
If you change your mind and tell, good.

783
01:57:48,413 --> 01:57:51,384
If not, you will be shot.

784
01:58:30,101 --> 01:58:33,025
- Do you think he was bluffing?
- No, he wasn't bluffing.

785
01:58:43,124 --> 01:58:44,959
He's the man I was to fight that duel with.

786
01:58:45,947 --> 01:58:48,785
Really? Quite a coincidence.

787
01:58:49,585 --> 01:58:52,982
- He's got it in for me.
- No, he's probably forgotten by this time.

788
01:58:57,146 --> 01:58:59,593
The brigade will be
going over pretty soon Monte.

789
01:58:59,866 --> 01:59:00,739
Yes.

790
01:59:18,952 --> 01:59:20,657
Roy, look.

791
01:59:23,442 --> 01:59:25,837
Oh, save it to wipe your nose on.

792
01:59:43,434 --> 01:59:45,009
God, what nerve.

793
01:59:47,300 --> 01:59:48,380
Roy.

794
01:59:50,463 --> 01:59:51,790
Roy, I can't face it.

795
01:59:52,701 --> 01:59:54,614
- I'm going to tell.
- Don't be a fool Monte.

796
01:59:54,927 --> 01:59:56,645
Do you realize what it would mean if we told?

797
01:59:56,675 --> 01:59:58,402
Would mean being
alive when this bloody war's over.

798
01:59:58,432 --> 01:59:59,339
But Monte, you can't.

799
01:59:59,369 --> 02:00:00,783
To hell with your heroic stuff,

800
02:00:00,926 --> 02:00:03,200
I want to live, I'm not
going to be shot down like that.

801
02:00:03,230 --> 02:00:05,117
- I'm going to tell.
- Wait a minute Monte.

802
02:00:05,147 --> 02:00:06,419
- But I...
- Listen.

803
02:00:09,667 --> 02:00:12,959
- Let me go.
- You?

804
02:00:13,155 --> 02:00:16,317
Yes, you're all upset.

805
02:00:16,969 --> 02:00:20,021
I'll bargain with him and perhaps
I won't have to tell him everything.

806
02:00:20,051 --> 02:00:21,869
- I, I'll come with you.
- No.

807
02:00:22,767 --> 02:00:26,919
You said he's got it in
for you, now let me do it alone.

808
02:00:28,155 --> 02:00:29,287
Alright.

809
02:00:39,595 --> 02:00:42,575
- Tell the general I'm ready to talk.
- Good, come.

810
02:01:10,084 --> 02:01:12,609
Ah, yes.

811
02:01:27,591 --> 02:01:30,363
- So, you've changed your mind?
- Yes.

812
02:01:31,580 --> 02:01:33,052
My friend will never tell.

813
02:01:34,190 --> 02:01:38,173
- But I want to live, I'm ready to talk.
- You are very wise.

814
02:01:41,180 --> 02:01:42,234
Now please,

815
02:01:42,264 --> 02:01:45,240
draw a rough map for me showing
your positions, brigade numbers...

816
02:01:45,270 --> 02:01:47,492
disposition, hour of attack,
purpose, number of men.

817
02:01:47,522 --> 02:01:48,559
Wait a minute.

818
02:01:49,353 --> 02:01:51,384
I'll tell only on one condition.

819
02:01:52,413 --> 02:01:54,885
- Ah, so, a condition?
- Yes.

820
02:01:55,953 --> 02:01:58,152
If I give this
information, my friend will know it.

821
02:01:59,197 --> 02:02:03,423
Back home after the war, he'll
tell everyone that I was a traitor.

822
02:02:03,905 --> 02:02:05,597
You leave that to me.

823
02:02:06,580 --> 02:02:09,111
Why not let me have that satisfaction?

824
02:02:09,931 --> 02:02:11,168
What do you mean?

825
02:02:21,294 --> 02:02:23,481
I do not understand.

826
02:02:24,744 --> 02:02:26,931
One does not kill a friend.

827
02:02:27,399 --> 02:02:30,614
Friend? He's not my friend.

828
02:02:31,212 --> 02:02:33,321
He stole the girl I love and I hate him.

829
02:02:35,390 --> 02:02:37,668
History repeats itself.

830
02:02:39,816 --> 02:02:42,067
You make rather hard terms.

831
02:02:43,083 --> 02:02:45,490
I'll tell only on that condition.

832
02:03:02,397 --> 02:03:03,451
One bullet.

833
02:03:04,388 --> 02:03:08,150
What if I miss? Give me two to make sure.

834
02:03:09,438 --> 02:03:13,330
No, a good soldier will need only one.

835
02:03:14,853 --> 02:03:16,961
- Very well.
- Not so fast.

836
02:03:26,945 --> 02:03:28,806
He will give you the bullet outside.

837
02:04:04,037 --> 02:04:05,117
Well?

838
02:04:09,855 --> 02:04:11,382
I didn't tell Monte.

839
02:04:13,018 --> 02:04:14,905
Why? What happened? Has he changed his mind?

840
02:04:15,517 --> 02:04:18,601
No, don't you think you
can go through with it now?

841
02:04:19,772 --> 02:04:20,879
What do you mean?

842
02:04:21,022 --> 02:04:23,625
Of course we can, it won't even hurt.

843
02:04:23,898 --> 02:04:27,698
It'll all be over in a second, we
can stand anything for a second.

844
02:04:28,596 --> 02:04:31,317
No, no Roy, I, I can't do it.

845
02:04:32,045 --> 02:04:33,776
- I'm going to tell.
- Listen Monte.

846
02:04:34,206 --> 02:04:36,509
We tell, the whole brigade will be wiped out.

847
02:04:36,899 --> 02:04:39,762
Three thousand men
and they all want to live too.

848
02:04:40,491 --> 02:04:42,287
You wouldn't spoil their chances, would you?

849
02:04:42,317 --> 02:04:45,931
That's not my business, I didn't start
this war, I didn't get them into this mess.

850
02:04:46,283 --> 02:04:49,225
Let them take care of themselves, they'll
get wiped out sooner or later anyway.

851
02:04:49,255 --> 02:04:52,582
I want to live, live.
You won't tell, I'll tell.

852
02:04:52,612 --> 02:04:54,274
- Listen Monte...
- I'll tell, I'll tell.

853
02:04:54,304 --> 02:04:57,281
Let me out, I'll tell everything I know.
The brigade is moving up.

854
02:04:57,311 --> 02:04:59,088
They're going to attack...

855
02:05:05,099 --> 02:05:06,778
Oh Roy...

856
02:05:09,464 --> 02:05:12,149
Oh Monte, Monte...

857
02:05:13,577 --> 02:05:14,482
Monte.

858
02:05:18,407 --> 02:05:19,693
Monte.

859
02:05:29,858 --> 02:05:31,098
Don't cry Roy.

860
02:05:35,045 --> 02:05:36,191
It was the only thing you...

861
02:05:37,516 --> 02:05:38,369
could do.

862
02:05:49,572 --> 02:05:52,484
- The brigade Roy.
- Yes, Monte?

863
02:05:54,436 --> 02:05:57,035
- They'll be all right now, won't they?
- Yes.

864
02:06:03,663 --> 02:06:06,269
- Who is that?
- It's the general.

865
02:06:11,472 --> 02:06:12,885
You thought we'd tell, didn't you?

866
02:06:15,924 --> 02:06:17,050
Good old Roy.

867
02:06:17,750 --> 02:06:19,023
You won't tell and I...

868
02:06:21,882 --> 02:06:24,754
forgotten it all.

869
02:06:26,646 --> 02:06:29,349
- Oh Roy, Roy...
- Yes.

870
02:06:31,737 --> 02:06:34,909
Where are you? Don't go away Roy.

871
02:06:35,768 --> 02:06:37,594
I'm here, Monte.

872
02:06:38,441 --> 02:06:39,854
Can't you feel me holding you?

873
02:06:49,677 --> 02:06:51,976
Hello Karl, fig eights.

874
02:06:55,446 --> 02:07:00,068
Cold up here in the night
patrol, awful to be in the dark.

875
02:07:04,201 --> 02:07:05,685
Oh. I'm afraid.

876
02:07:09,915 --> 02:07:11,998
Look out, look out.

877
02:07:12,453 --> 02:07:16,709
We're falling, we're
going to crash, do something Roy.

878
02:07:16,943 --> 02:07:19,663
Quick, quick, quick.

879
02:07:20,223 --> 02:07:23,203
It's all right Monte, Monte?

880
02:07:24,061 --> 02:07:25,324
It's all right.

881
02:07:27,302 --> 02:07:29,359
Monte? Monte.

882
02:07:45,668 --> 02:07:46,800
Well?

883
02:07:59,542 --> 02:08:04,956
- You heard what my brother said.
- Your brother?

884
02:08:07,052 --> 02:08:09,226
I'll never tell you anything.

885
02:08:53,685 --> 02:08:54,700
Achtung.

886
02:09:26,216 --> 02:09:29,249
I'll be with you in just a minute Monte.

887
02:10:14,307 --> 02:10:17,587
Come on you Seventh Brigade, we got them now.

887
