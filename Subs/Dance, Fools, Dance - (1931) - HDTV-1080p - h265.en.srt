1
00:01:29,476 --> 00:01:32,688
If something doesn't
happen pretty soon, I'll die.

2
00:01:32,813 --> 00:01:34,565
Alright.
I'll fix that.

3
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:37,276
One moment, everybody.

4
00:01:37,401 --> 00:01:39,069
Bonnie's going to dance.

5
00:01:41,989 --> 00:01:44,575
Now make it hot.

6
00:01:57,879 --> 00:01:59,464
Done.

7
00:02:15,188 --> 00:02:18,108
I wish I were in his shoes.

8
00:02:28,118 --> 00:02:30,621
A little number
sis picked up in Biarritz.

9
00:02:30,746 --> 00:02:32,789
Making rather an open play
for Bob, isn't she?

10
00:02:32,914 --> 00:02:34,750
I'm betting on her to win.

11
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:37,294
You Jordans don't exactly hate
yourselves, do you?

12
00:02:37,419 --> 00:02:40,130
Certainly not.
Why, we're just crazy about us.

13
00:02:40,255 --> 00:02:41,590
Yes.

14
00:02:48,263 --> 00:02:49,890
That's right.
Cha-cha-cha.

15
00:02:57,272 --> 00:03:00,275
Bob, behave yourself there,
buddy.

16
00:03:30,389 --> 00:03:31,431
Whoo!

17
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:36,603
Ha ha!
There we are.

18
00:03:36,728 --> 00:03:38,563
Oh, let's have a little...

19
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:40,982
Mmm.
Whew.

20
00:03:46,738 --> 00:03:48,156
Thank you.

21
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:50,409
$900.

22
00:03:50,534 --> 00:03:51,702
Not so good.

23
00:03:51,827 --> 00:03:53,704
- Marvin.
- Yes?

24
00:03:53,829 --> 00:03:55,497
Young people seem
to be enjoying themselves.

25
00:03:55,622 --> 00:03:59,000
Well,
you're only young once.

26
00:03:59,126 --> 00:04:02,129
I don't want my children
to have the hard time I had.

27
00:04:02,254 --> 00:04:04,715
Spare the rod
and spoil the child.

28
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,384
Well, it's a good alibi.

29
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,885
- Alibi?
- Yeah.

30
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,471
For running up
Consolidated Air 200 points.

31
00:04:11,596 --> 00:04:14,975
Well, we must take advantage
of the present market, D.L.

32
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:17,018
Haven't seen
anything like it in,

33
00:04:17,144 --> 00:04:18,895
well, not in my experience.

34
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:20,897
I've been playing the market
all my life.

35
00:04:21,022 --> 00:04:24,192
I withstood
the panic of 1906

36
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:25,902
the slump after the war,

37
00:04:26,027 --> 00:04:28,989
and here I am once again
sitting on top of the world.

38
00:04:29,114 --> 00:04:31,658
Well, I'm printing
a story tomorrow

39
00:04:31,783 --> 00:04:34,286
that may bring you down
a peg or two.

40
00:04:34,411 --> 00:04:37,914
Oh, Blair.
Blair, you and your Herald.

41
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:40,250
You're the worst calamity teller
in town.

42
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,004
Just the same,
the market's crazy.

43
00:04:44,129 --> 00:04:46,465
Stocks aren't worth
that much.

44
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:49,134
You've been saying that
for the past six months.

45
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:52,012
- Yeah.
- Stocks are still going up.

46
00:04:58,727 --> 00:05:00,020
Oh, everybody's dying.

47
00:05:00,145 --> 00:05:01,646
Come on.
Let's get the party going.

48
00:05:01,772 --> 00:05:03,148
- Do something, will you?
- Alright.

49
00:05:03,273 --> 00:05:04,608
Listen, everybody.

50
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:05,776
How about
a little moonlight bathing?

51
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,652
Cool the fevered brow, huh?

52
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,321
I've always wanted to
go swimming at night.

53
00:05:09,446 --> 00:05:11,156
Ooh, I hope it isn't cold.

54
00:05:11,281 --> 00:05:13,241
Well, I hope it is
after 97 all day in the shade.

55
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:15,827
But, Bob, we won't have enough
suits to go around.

56
00:05:15,952 --> 00:05:20,248
Wait.
Allen, lights out.

57
00:05:20,373 --> 00:05:23,460
Alright. Stand by, everybody,
and off with your clothes.

58
00:05:23,585 --> 00:05:24,628
Come on.

59
00:05:26,004 --> 00:05:27,297
Yeah. Why not?

60
00:06:06,211 --> 00:06:08,505
Hey, Bonnie!

61
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,965
Where's Bonnie?

62
00:06:11,341 --> 00:06:12,717
Dive for her, Bob.
This isn't funny.

63
00:06:12,843 --> 00:06:14,052
What is it, Rod?
What is it?

64
00:06:14,177 --> 00:06:15,428
It's Bonnie.
She hasn't come up yet.

65
00:06:15,554 --> 00:06:17,013
Somebody ought to do something.

66
00:06:17,138 --> 00:06:19,432
Bob? Bob, why don't you do
something for her?

67
00:06:19,558 --> 00:06:20,976
Dive, boy! Dive!

68
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:27,649
Oh!

69
00:06:28,984 --> 00:06:30,777
Gee, you certainly had us
worried.

70
00:06:30,902 --> 00:06:33,154
Oh, you little minx!

71
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,907
Sometimes I'm sorry
you're too old to spank.

72
00:06:38,743 --> 00:06:40,203
Oh, I know.

73
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:42,998
If I ever say anything,
I'm old-fashioned.

74
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:46,835
Whew!

75
00:06:50,839 --> 00:06:52,924
Staged that pretty well,
didn't she?

76
00:06:53,049 --> 00:06:56,177
Gee, what a girl. If I were
Bob Townsend and she loved me...

77
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:02,475
I don't see
her fascination.

78
00:07:02,601 --> 00:07:05,353
No? Well, uh...

79
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:01,826
You know I'm very much in love
with you, don't you?

80
00:08:01,952 --> 00:08:03,787
Are you?

81
00:08:03,912 --> 00:08:05,789
I'm crazy about you,
and you know it.

82
00:08:05,914 --> 00:08:07,123
I didn't know.

83
00:08:07,248 --> 00:08:09,709
Well, you know it now.
What about it?

84
00:08:09,834 --> 00:08:11,878
That's it. What?

85
00:08:12,003 --> 00:08:14,089
Going to make me
stand on ceremony?

86
00:08:14,214 --> 00:08:15,715
You think
I'm so old-fashioned?

87
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:16,883
I hope not.

88
00:08:17,008 --> 00:08:19,636
You're right.
I'm not.

89
00:08:19,761 --> 00:08:22,430
I believe in...

90
00:08:22,555 --> 00:08:24,307
in trying love out.

91
00:08:24,432 --> 00:08:26,643
On approval?

92
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:28,353
Yes.

93
00:08:28,478 --> 00:08:30,063
On approval.

94
00:09:33,835 --> 00:09:35,253
Good morning, Dad.

95
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:37,172
Hmm.

96
00:09:37,297 --> 00:09:39,132
I was just wondering if you
were going to sleep all day.

97
00:09:40,592 --> 00:09:42,427
- Where's your brother?
- I don't know.

98
00:09:42,552 --> 00:09:45,555
You know, the only thing
I demand of you children is

99
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,973
that you...

100
00:09:47,098 --> 00:09:48,767
Speak of the devil.

101
00:09:56,066 --> 00:09:58,109
Ah, seltzer, Greg.

102
00:10:01,654 --> 00:10:04,657
Everybody's so sociable
in this house at breakfast.

103
00:10:04,783 --> 00:10:06,409
I never could see the idea

104
00:10:06,534 --> 00:10:07,702
of dragging us out of bed
in the middle of the night —

105
00:10:07,827 --> 00:10:09,245
Shh!

106
00:10:09,370 --> 00:10:12,248
Rodney, Halsey tells me
you're drinking too much.

107
00:10:12,373 --> 00:10:14,167
I'll push that old fool's face
in for him

108
00:10:14,292 --> 00:10:15,376
if he starts blabbing.

109
00:10:15,502 --> 00:10:18,630
- Better cut it down.
- Sure.

110
00:10:23,384 --> 00:10:26,304
Must you smoke
before breakfast?

111
00:10:26,429 --> 00:10:30,517
Well, I must
if I want to keep thin, darling.

112
00:10:30,642 --> 00:10:32,227
What's the matter, Daddy?

113
00:10:32,352 --> 00:10:33,311
Isn't the market behaving?

114
00:10:33,436 --> 00:10:35,939
The market's rather unsteady.

115
00:10:36,064 --> 00:10:39,901
Oh, by the way,
have you seen Dr. Reed lately?

116
00:10:40,026 --> 00:10:42,612
Maybe you're teething.

117
00:10:42,737 --> 00:10:45,281
Yes, I saw him last Friday.

118
00:10:45,406 --> 00:10:47,158
I haven't had time since.

119
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,410
International Copper
dropped ten points

120
00:10:49,536 --> 00:10:52,914
while he was making
a metabolism test.

121
00:10:53,039 --> 00:10:55,125
And your blood pressure
skyrocketed.

122
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:56,543
Oh.

123
00:10:56,668 --> 00:10:58,461
A gentleman
to see Mr. Rodney.

124
00:10:58,586 --> 00:10:59,921
Me?

125
00:11:00,046 --> 00:11:02,715
Oh, it's Wally.
Excuse me.

126
00:11:07,011 --> 00:11:08,930
- Hello, Wally.
- Hello, Rod.

127
00:11:15,311 --> 00:11:16,813
Say, I've got
to have some good stuff.

128
00:11:16,938 --> 00:11:18,439
There's a buffet luncheon
at Connie King's today

129
00:11:18,565 --> 00:11:20,150
and I've been asked to pour.

130
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:22,193
Oh, I see.
Gonna tote your own?

131
00:11:22,318 --> 00:11:23,736
I don't trust
their bootlegger.

132
00:11:23,862 --> 00:11:25,864
Well, what do you want,
rye or Scotch?

133
00:11:25,989 --> 00:11:27,824
Same as the last.

134
00:11:27,949 --> 00:11:31,077
Want to settle for it now?

135
00:11:31,202 --> 00:11:33,079
The head man's
sort of shot this morning.

136
00:11:33,204 --> 00:11:34,664
You'd better let it ride.

137
00:11:34,789 --> 00:11:36,499
Well, that's okay with me.

138
00:11:36,624 --> 00:11:38,835
- Two suitcases, imported.
- Fine.

139
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,128
Okay, Rod.
It will be there.

140
00:11:40,253 --> 00:11:42,172
- So long.
- So long, Wally.

141
00:12:03,985 --> 00:12:06,112
Sell 10,000 and a quarter!

142
00:12:14,829 --> 00:12:17,665
Sell 5,000 Jordan Chemical
at 220!

143
00:12:17,790 --> 00:12:21,127
Ten thousand call of
a quarter and an eighth!

144
00:12:21,252 --> 00:12:24,797
Five thousand Jordan Chemical
at 200.

145
00:12:33,306 --> 00:12:35,516
Look.
Monty Jordan's on the floor.

146
00:12:35,642 --> 00:12:37,310
That looks bad,
doesn't it?

147
00:12:39,646 --> 00:12:41,397
Hey, Mont, you fool.
Get back in your office.

148
00:12:41,522 --> 00:12:43,233
- How late is this tape?
- About an hour and a half.

149
00:12:43,358 --> 00:12:44,943
Look, get off the floor,
for the love of...

150
00:12:45,068 --> 00:12:46,819
You're tipping off
your hand.

151
00:12:49,697 --> 00:12:54,035
Offer!
20,000 Jordan Chemical!

152
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,205
Offer!
20,000 Jordan Chemical!

153
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,418
What's bid,
Jordan Chemical?

154
00:13:02,543 --> 00:13:04,045
Yes, what is the bid?

155
00:13:04,170 --> 00:13:06,089
I haven't a bid at any price.

156
00:13:06,214 --> 00:13:07,548
That's a quarter.

157
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:12,262
No bid?

158
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:17,350
Monty!

159
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:19,269
Come on, you fellas,
give me a hand here.

160
00:13:50,425 --> 00:13:52,802
Mr. Selby is calling.
Shall I show him in?

161
00:13:52,927 --> 00:13:54,178
Would you please, Albert?

162
00:13:54,304 --> 00:13:55,972
It's probably something
about Dad's will.

163
00:13:56,097 --> 00:13:57,640
Yes, no doubt.

164
00:13:59,892 --> 00:14:01,561
Bonnie.

165
00:14:01,686 --> 00:14:04,105
I'm very sorry for you,
my dear.

166
00:14:04,230 --> 00:14:05,481
I was fond of your father.

167
00:14:05,606 --> 00:14:07,025
Won't you sit down?

168
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:09,902
Thank you.

169
00:14:10,028 --> 00:14:12,196
- Hello, Rodney.
- How do you do, sir?

170
00:14:15,033 --> 00:14:16,451
Well?

171
00:14:16,576 --> 00:14:18,619
I regret intruding so soon
on your sorrow.

172
00:14:18,745 --> 00:14:20,705
But I've been worrying
about you two.

173
00:14:20,830 --> 00:14:23,624
Wondering if you've made
any plans for the future.

174
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:25,710
If you knew
how things stand.

175
00:14:25,835 --> 00:14:27,378
No, not exactly.

176
00:14:27,503 --> 00:14:30,340
Well, I know Dad was hit
pretty hard in the crash.

177
00:14:30,465 --> 00:14:32,383
I thought while things
are being adjusted

178
00:14:32,508 --> 00:14:34,677
I'd take a little flying trip
to Florida.

179
00:14:34,802 --> 00:14:37,513
Bonnie might go abroad.
You know, change of scene.

180
00:14:37,638 --> 00:14:39,349
It's a pretty good idea,
isn't it?

181
00:14:39,474 --> 00:14:41,642
I'm afraid you don't
quite realize the situation.

182
00:14:41,768 --> 00:14:44,187
Your father
was wiped out completely.

183
00:14:46,481 --> 00:14:47,899
You mean there's
nothing left for us?

184
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:49,525
You're quite penniless.

185
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,070
But there must be some money
somewhere, there must be.

186
00:14:52,195 --> 00:14:53,738
Hadn't Daddy
any life insurance?

187
00:14:53,863 --> 00:14:56,115
His heart.
You know he wasn't a good risk.

188
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,618
But what's going
to become of us?

189
00:14:58,743 --> 00:15:00,870
- How are we going to live?
- I don't know.

190
00:15:00,995 --> 00:15:02,705
Unless you do as a
great many others have done

191
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,583
in these circumstances —
Go to work.

192
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,377
Work? Ha!

193
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:10,171
Rod...

194
00:15:10,296 --> 00:15:12,256
You see, Mr. Selby,

195
00:15:12,382 --> 00:15:14,550
it's all happened
so suddenly that,

196
00:15:14,675 --> 00:15:17,095
well, it's quite difficult
to realize.

197
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:18,721
I know.

198
00:15:18,846 --> 00:15:22,100
But you're young, my dear,
and very pretty.

199
00:15:22,225 --> 00:15:25,978
Surely there's — there's
some nice, young man who...

200
00:15:26,104 --> 00:15:27,980
Who might want to marry me?

201
00:15:31,526 --> 00:15:33,403
I don't know.

202
00:15:33,528 --> 00:15:37,281
Rodney, there's Andrew Cowan
of First National.

203
00:15:37,407 --> 00:15:38,658
He was a friend
of your father's.

204
00:15:38,783 --> 00:15:40,284
He might give you a start.

205
00:15:40,410 --> 00:15:42,787
Yeah, as a teller
in one of his banks.

206
00:15:42,912 --> 00:15:45,706
I should stand behind a cage
and dole out dollar bills.

207
00:15:45,832 --> 00:15:47,917
Well, you'll have
to start somewhere, my boy.

208
00:15:48,042 --> 00:15:50,420
Your father
started at the bottom.

209
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:52,088
Look at the fortune
he made.

210
00:15:52,213 --> 00:15:53,965
Yes, look at it.
Where is it?

211
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:56,008
He might have kept something
to leave his children.

212
00:15:56,134 --> 00:15:58,803
We're not prepared to work.
We didn't even finish school.

213
00:15:58,928 --> 00:16:02,223
Rod, he wanted us to finish
school, but we wouldn't.

214
00:16:02,348 --> 00:16:04,225
Don't start blaming him.
It isn't fair.

215
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:06,477
Alright.
It's our own fault, then.

216
00:16:06,602 --> 00:16:08,146
But does that
make it any easier?

217
00:16:08,271 --> 00:16:11,357
Oh, Roddy.

218
00:16:11,482 --> 00:16:14,444
We mustn't bother Mr. Selby
with our troubles.

219
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:16,654
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

220
00:16:16,779 --> 00:16:20,116
But I-I took a pretty stiff
licking myself on the market

221
00:16:20,241 --> 00:16:22,785
and have to pay for my folly
with the rest of the fools.

222
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:24,662
Good bye.

223
00:16:24,787 --> 00:16:26,497
Goodbye and thank you.

224
00:16:39,719 --> 00:16:42,388
Two men who say they're from
the auctioneer, Miss Jordan.

225
00:16:42,513 --> 00:16:43,723
They've come to price
the furniture.

226
00:16:43,848 --> 00:16:45,975
Yes, I was expecting them.

227
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,268
And, Albert...

228
00:16:48,978 --> 00:16:52,899
I'm sorry, but we shan't
need you any longer.

229
00:16:53,024 --> 00:16:56,402
Would you tell the cook
and Pearl and the others?

230
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:57,820
Very good, miss.

231
00:17:03,659 --> 00:17:07,580
Ah! Here comes your erstwhile
devoted Mr. Townsend.

232
00:17:18,716 --> 00:17:19,967
Bob.

233
00:17:25,097 --> 00:17:28,100
You won't need this.

234
00:17:28,226 --> 00:17:30,436
I'm leaving you
to your golden opportunity, sis.

235
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:34,315
Remember, wealthy bachelors
don't grow on every rosebush.

236
00:17:37,485 --> 00:17:39,904
- Hello, Rod.
- Hello, Bob.

237
00:17:48,579 --> 00:17:50,331
Nice of you to come.

238
00:17:50,456 --> 00:17:52,375
What can I say, Bonnie?

239
00:17:54,835 --> 00:17:56,546
It's enough that you came.

240
00:17:56,671 --> 00:17:59,257
I haven't had you off my mind
since it happened.

241
00:18:02,426 --> 00:18:03,427
The appraisers, miss.

242
00:18:03,553 --> 00:18:04,929
Would you ask them to work

243
00:18:05,054 --> 00:18:06,889
in some other part of the house,
please, Albert?

244
00:18:07,014 --> 00:18:08,474
Very good, miss.

245
00:18:10,434 --> 00:18:12,144
Appraisers?

246
00:18:12,270 --> 00:18:13,604
Getting ready
for the auction.

247
00:18:13,729 --> 00:18:15,481
Auction?

248
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:16,857
We're cleaned out.

249
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:18,359
Sounds like a bad dream,
doesn't it?

250
00:18:18,484 --> 00:18:21,988
Why, the...
the whole works?

251
00:18:22,113 --> 00:18:25,950
House, yacht, furniture,
everything.

252
00:18:26,075 --> 00:18:28,452
Nothing left
but my reputation.

253
00:18:29,704 --> 00:18:31,038
Sit down, won't you?

254
00:18:38,087 --> 00:18:39,630
Aw, gee.

255
00:18:39,755 --> 00:18:41,507
Why didn't you let me know,
Bonnie?

256
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,884
- Why?
- Well, I...

257
00:18:50,016 --> 00:18:52,310
Sort of a jam, isn't it?

258
00:18:52,435 --> 00:18:53,811
Sort of.

259
00:18:55,771 --> 00:18:58,399
Well, you know
you can count on me.

260
00:18:58,524 --> 00:18:59,984
I'll do the right thing,
Bonnie.

261
00:19:01,611 --> 00:19:03,529
The right thing?

262
00:19:03,654 --> 00:19:05,906
I'll marry you, of course.

263
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,586
That is, if you...

264
00:19:21,672 --> 00:19:22,882
That's funny.

265
00:19:23,007 --> 00:19:24,967
- Funny?
- Yes.

266
00:19:25,092 --> 00:19:27,720
What's funny?

267
00:19:27,845 --> 00:19:30,765
Your thinking
you ought to marry me.

268
00:19:30,890 --> 00:19:32,892
It's the least I can do,
isn't it?

269
00:19:52,703 --> 00:19:54,163
Kiss me, Bob.

270
00:20:04,382 --> 00:20:06,008
Don't be silly, darling.

271
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:07,635
You don't have to be a martyr
to the cause.

272
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,637
Everything's 50-50.
You know that.

273
00:20:09,762 --> 00:20:11,389
You mean that?

274
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:12,848
Fifty-fifty.

275
00:20:12,973 --> 00:20:15,935
Absolutely no obligation
on anybody's part.

276
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,437
So, cheer up.
No wedding bells for us.

277
00:20:18,562 --> 00:20:19,814
You're not being heroic?

278
00:20:19,939 --> 00:20:22,149
I'm quite myself,
I assure you.

279
00:20:22,274 --> 00:20:24,568
I like my freedom
just as much as you do, Bob,

280
00:20:24,694 --> 00:20:26,362
and I intend to keep it.

281
00:20:26,487 --> 00:20:30,074
Well!
Spoken like a gentlewoman.

282
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:31,867
Oh, good scald, Bonnie.

283
00:20:31,992 --> 00:20:33,703
Gee, I might have known it.

284
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,376
Relieved?

285
00:20:40,501 --> 00:20:42,169
Well, I — I hadn't
exactly figured

286
00:20:42,294 --> 00:20:45,464
on walking down the aisle,
not this winter.

287
00:20:45,589 --> 00:20:47,216
Oh, but give me credit.
I was willing.

288
00:20:47,341 --> 00:20:50,094
Noble Bacchus.
Spoken like a gentleman.

289
00:20:51,762 --> 00:20:53,139
- Smoke?
- Sure.

290
00:21:10,489 --> 00:21:13,284
- No?
- No.

291
00:21:14,785 --> 00:21:18,998
Bob, would —
would you mind going now?

292
00:21:21,917 --> 00:21:24,712
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

293
00:21:26,630 --> 00:21:28,758
And if there's anything
I can do, Bonnie,

294
00:21:28,883 --> 00:21:30,551
I hope you'll let me know.

295
00:21:30,676 --> 00:21:32,720
Nice of you to call.

296
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:17,723
You know, I'd like to have
these drapes.

297
00:22:22,311 --> 00:22:25,231
Can you imagine
Bonnie Jordan poor?

298
00:22:25,356 --> 00:22:26,524
It must be
an awful letdown.

299
00:22:26,649 --> 00:22:28,108
Serves her right.

300
00:22:28,234 --> 00:22:31,737
Imagined every man was crazy
about her, even Bob.

301
00:22:31,862 --> 00:22:33,656
Well, this will take her
down a peg or two.

302
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:35,324
I wonder if they're selling
all the furniture.

303
00:22:35,449 --> 00:22:37,117
I hope so.

304
00:22:37,243 --> 00:22:39,370
I'm gonna make a bid for that
little spinet desk of hers.

305
00:22:39,495 --> 00:22:41,163
I've had my eye on it
for ages.

306
00:22:41,288 --> 00:22:42,957
You'll find seats
right over here.

307
00:22:43,082 --> 00:22:44,959
The next we have to offer
is this genuine

308
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:46,418
Chippendale settee.

309
00:22:46,544 --> 00:22:48,671
Speak right up now.
What are my bids?

310
00:22:48,796 --> 00:22:50,339
One hundred dollars? Thank you.
Start at $100.

311
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:52,758
Now $100.
100. Who will make it 125?

312
00:22:52,883 --> 00:22:56,220
125. 125. Do I hear 150?
Do I hear 150?

313
00:23:01,433 --> 00:23:02,643
Good morning.

314
00:23:02,768 --> 00:23:04,311
Good?
That's rich.

315
00:23:04,436 --> 00:23:06,313
With the house
being sold over our heads?

316
00:23:06,438 --> 00:23:08,983
I know.
The auction's in full swing.

317
00:23:09,108 --> 00:23:11,026
Going, going, gone.

318
00:23:11,151 --> 00:23:13,571
It's a tough break,
being left stranded like this.

319
00:23:13,696 --> 00:23:14,822
Why, we're paupers.

320
00:23:14,947 --> 00:23:16,365
Well, there's no use
crying about it.

321
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:18,200
Buck up.

322
00:23:18,325 --> 00:23:21,537
Put on your spurs and gauntlets
and give the world a battle.

323
00:23:21,662 --> 00:23:22,788
Swat 'em in the eye.

324
00:23:22,913 --> 00:23:25,666
Yeah? Just how?

325
00:23:25,791 --> 00:23:28,043
Go to work.
I'm not afraid.

326
00:23:28,168 --> 00:23:29,670
You?
Why, what could you do?

327
00:23:29,795 --> 00:23:31,881
Open up a tea shoppie?

328
00:23:32,006 --> 00:23:34,258
"Bonnie Jordan's
orange pekoe blend."

329
00:23:34,383 --> 00:23:35,718
Go to it.

330
00:23:35,843 --> 00:23:38,804
No. No tea shoppies
for Bonnie Jordan.

331
00:23:38,929 --> 00:23:40,431
Well, what, then?
Model for a living?

332
00:23:40,556 --> 00:23:43,267
Parade in front of all
our sympathetic friends?

333
00:23:43,392 --> 00:23:45,936
Two to the right.
Two to the left.

334
00:23:46,061 --> 00:23:47,897
Pose and smile sweetly.

335
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:49,607
Oh, I'm not gonna do
any of those

336
00:23:49,732 --> 00:23:52,359
stupid, silly,
conventional things.

337
00:23:52,484 --> 00:23:54,069
You'd be surprised
what a young girl can earn

338
00:23:54,194 --> 00:23:55,696
when she sets her mind
to it.

339
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:57,197
I'm no dud.

340
00:23:57,323 --> 00:23:59,575
You've got the looks, kid.
Trade on them.

341
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,243
Open up a beauty parlor.

342
00:24:01,368 --> 00:24:04,204
"Bonnie Jordan's face cream.
Works while you sleep."

343
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:06,957
You get the works,
and they get the sleep.

344
00:24:07,082 --> 00:24:08,751
That's your idea of me, huh?

345
00:24:08,876 --> 00:24:10,252
Beautiful but dumb.

346
00:24:10,377 --> 00:24:12,087
Alright.
I'll show you.

347
00:24:12,212 --> 00:24:15,633
I'm going out to get myself
a man-sized job.

348
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:17,426
You can do
exactly as you please.

349
00:24:17,551 --> 00:24:19,178
Alright.
I'll get drunk.

350
00:24:22,389 --> 00:24:24,850
Oh, Rod,
what good will that do?

351
00:24:24,975 --> 00:24:27,686
A lot of good.
At least for the time being.

352
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:30,230
- And then?
- The hangover.

353
00:24:30,356 --> 00:24:33,275
Darling, if you'd only
pull yourself together.

354
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:36,111
I'll stick to you through thick
and thin. See if I don't.

355
00:24:36,236 --> 00:24:37,780
Let's not get emotional
about it.

356
00:24:37,905 --> 00:24:40,449
- Oh, but, darling —
- Don't mollycoddle me.

357
00:24:40,574 --> 00:24:42,618
I'll pull out of it
someday.

358
00:24:42,743 --> 00:24:43,786
Maybe.

359
00:24:59,093 --> 00:25:00,260
Boy?

360
00:25:04,556 --> 00:25:05,683
Boy?

361
00:25:52,646 --> 00:25:53,731
Boy?

362
00:26:03,032 --> 00:26:04,199
Boy?

363
00:26:05,826 --> 00:26:07,077
Boy?

364
00:26:07,202 --> 00:26:09,955
Hello! When did she come
on the paper?

365
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,623
Last week.
Swell kid, too.

366
00:26:11,749 --> 00:26:14,418
Yeah? Well, how did she get
into this racket?

367
00:26:14,543 --> 00:26:17,171
Friend of the managing editor.
He's giving her a try.

368
00:26:17,296 --> 00:26:20,841
Yeah? What for?
To rest his eyes?

369
00:26:28,932 --> 00:26:30,100
What's this?

370
00:26:30,225 --> 00:26:32,061
The Jackson Park
Poultry Show.

371
00:26:32,186 --> 00:26:34,480
Mr. Boole has a photograph
of the prize rooster.

372
00:26:39,443 --> 00:26:41,195
Copyboy?

373
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:46,325
Is this all of it?

374
00:26:46,450 --> 00:26:49,244
Yes, sir.
But I could write some more.

375
00:26:49,369 --> 00:26:53,082
There's your story
in the first three paragraphs.

376
00:26:53,207 --> 00:26:56,001
You can have the rest of it.

377
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:58,253
Great story
about the poultry show, boys.

378
00:26:58,378 --> 00:27:01,590
Give it a box
on the front page.

379
00:27:01,715 --> 00:27:03,425
Oh.
Thank you.

380
00:27:06,220 --> 00:27:09,056
Cut it down to 50 words.
Home and garden section.

381
00:27:24,613 --> 00:27:25,989
All through?

382
00:27:26,115 --> 00:27:29,201
Yes. I've done my one good deed
for the day.

383
00:27:29,326 --> 00:27:30,577
Yeah?

384
00:27:30,702 --> 00:27:33,622
Could have saved myself
a lot of trouble.

385
00:27:33,747 --> 00:27:35,999
You'll learn, kid.

386
00:27:36,125 --> 00:27:38,585
Clearness, condensation.

387
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,297
Where, what, when, and why?
That's the idea.

388
00:27:42,422 --> 00:27:45,634
Say, don't let those guys
over on the copydesk bother you.

389
00:27:45,759 --> 00:27:48,178
They're just a lot of butchers
at heart.

390
00:27:48,303 --> 00:27:50,055
Why, you know what they'd do
if they got a chance?

391
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,807
What?

392
00:27:51,932 --> 00:27:55,185
They'd cut the Lord's Prayer
down to a one-line squib.

393
00:27:55,310 --> 00:27:58,647
You know,
"Now I lay me down to sleep."

394
00:28:02,192 --> 00:28:03,861
I like you.

395
00:28:03,986 --> 00:28:06,196
Oh, yeah?

396
00:28:06,321 --> 00:28:07,781
Come on.
Give a little girl a hand.

397
00:28:07,906 --> 00:28:09,449
Sure.

398
00:28:09,575 --> 00:28:13,662
Just for that, lady,
I'll see you to your limousine.

399
00:28:15,789 --> 00:28:17,958
- Tally?
- Ho.

400
00:28:18,083 --> 00:28:20,210
- Live far?
- Unh-unh.

401
00:28:20,335 --> 00:28:22,462
- Boarding?
- No.

402
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:25,591
Gee, I'd hate to have to get
a story out of you.

403
00:28:25,716 --> 00:28:28,385
Say, you must come up sometime
and try my cooking.

404
00:28:28,510 --> 00:28:29,595
I will.

405
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,638
- I love homemade cooking.
- Yeah?

406
00:28:31,763 --> 00:28:33,891
Say, do you know what your next
assignment's going to be?

407
00:28:34,016 --> 00:28:37,769
No, but, gee, I'd like to get
a chance at some real news once.

408
00:28:37,895 --> 00:28:39,479
Oh, you'll get along.

409
00:28:39,605 --> 00:28:41,899
All cubs have to start out
the same way.

410
00:28:42,024 --> 00:28:43,275
Yeah.

411
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:44,776
You know a story
I'd like to see written?

412
00:28:44,902 --> 00:28:45,986
No, what?

413
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:47,905
"Society girl turns reporter."

414
00:28:49,865 --> 00:28:53,577
Well, I'm afraid that's one
story that never will be wrote.

415
00:28:53,702 --> 00:28:55,162
Yeah?

416
00:28:55,287 --> 00:28:58,498
Said she stepping grandly
upon the omnibus.

417
00:29:08,050 --> 00:29:09,635
Thanks for the buggy ride.

418
00:29:14,014 --> 00:29:17,351
Hey, what do you think this is,
a sightseeing bus?

419
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:25,817
Roddy?

420
00:29:25,943 --> 00:29:27,152
- Hello, kid.
- Hello.

421
00:29:27,277 --> 00:29:29,238
- How's the little newshound?
- Well...

422
00:29:29,363 --> 00:29:33,033
Hey, Bon, what's become
of my blue-polka-dot tie?

423
00:29:33,158 --> 00:29:34,618
Blue polka dot.

424
00:29:34,743 --> 00:29:36,495
Oh, you mean the one
with the lifesavers on it?

425
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:38,747
Yeah, the nautical number.

426
00:29:38,872 --> 00:29:39,957
I'll get it.

427
00:29:44,878 --> 00:29:46,296
Here you are.

428
00:29:46,421 --> 00:29:48,298
- Oh, that's great.
- Look at it.

429
00:29:48,423 --> 00:29:50,175
It's all mended with
my little thread and needle.

430
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,468
Fine.

431
00:29:51,593 --> 00:29:54,012
How's that
for a mark of devotion?

432
00:29:54,137 --> 00:29:55,681
You're all there, honey.

433
00:29:55,806 --> 00:29:58,016
I appreciate you,
even if The Star doesn't.

434
00:29:58,141 --> 00:30:00,269
- Oh, guess what.
- What?

435
00:30:00,394 --> 00:30:02,729
I was graduated
to the poultry show today.

436
00:30:02,854 --> 00:30:05,190
- Yeah? That's fine.
- Mm-hmm.

437
00:30:05,315 --> 00:30:06,650
You know, I used to think
that Plymouth Rock

438
00:30:06,775 --> 00:30:08,777
was a place
where the Pilgrims landed.

439
00:30:10,195 --> 00:30:12,281
- We all learn.
- Yeah, we do.

440
00:30:40,726 --> 00:30:43,687
Oh, Roddy, coffee with
your dinner tonight?

441
00:30:43,812 --> 00:30:45,564
Don't cook anything for me
tonight, sis.

442
00:30:45,689 --> 00:30:47,816
I've got to see a man
on business.

443
00:30:49,067 --> 00:30:50,902
Gee,
any prospects of a job?

444
00:30:51,028 --> 00:30:53,196
All the earmarks
of a paid proposition.

445
00:30:53,322 --> 00:30:56,491
Oh, Roddy!
Gee, I'm glad.

446
00:30:56,616 --> 00:30:58,327
Honey, you don't know
the thrill

447
00:30:58,452 --> 00:31:00,245
of trying to make good
on your own.

448
00:31:00,370 --> 00:31:01,788
Not just trading on your name

449
00:31:01,913 --> 00:31:04,041
and running around
to parties all the time.

450
00:31:04,166 --> 00:31:05,667
Suited me alright.

451
00:31:05,792 --> 00:31:07,461
And I'll have you
out of this dump pretty soon,

452
00:31:07,586 --> 00:31:09,463
running with the old crowd
where you belong.

453
00:31:13,383 --> 00:31:14,843
You know, Roddy,

454
00:31:14,968 --> 00:31:16,386
I'm not so sure
that I'd like to run around

455
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:18,096
with the old crowd again.

456
00:31:18,221 --> 00:31:19,639
Why?

457
00:31:19,765 --> 00:31:22,351
I used to think anything I did
was alright.

458
00:31:22,476 --> 00:31:25,687
I was Bonnie Jordan
in society.

459
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:28,398
Society.

460
00:31:28,523 --> 00:31:30,067
What is it
but a lot of people

461
00:31:30,192 --> 00:31:32,361
who are for you when you're
on the up-and-up and...

462
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:33,862
what would one of them
do for you

463
00:31:33,987 --> 00:31:35,614
when it came to a showdown?

464
00:31:35,739 --> 00:31:39,826
Nothing, except grab your
pet belongings at an auction.

465
00:31:39,951 --> 00:31:42,662
The gang have sort of let us
down since we lost out.

466
00:31:42,788 --> 00:31:45,290
Oh, I'm not fooled
about why we were in society.

467
00:31:45,415 --> 00:31:47,084
It was because father
had a lot of money.

468
00:31:47,209 --> 00:31:50,670
But was that any credit to us?
We didn't make it.

469
00:31:50,796 --> 00:31:52,631
You know,
it isn't who you are, Roddy.

470
00:31:52,756 --> 00:31:54,257
It's what you are that counts.

471
00:31:54,383 --> 00:31:55,509
You're willing
to sign that article?

472
00:31:55,634 --> 00:31:57,552
"By Bonnie Jordan."

473
00:31:57,677 --> 00:31:59,888
What's the new job?

474
00:32:00,013 --> 00:32:02,099
Mmm, selling.

475
00:32:02,224 --> 00:32:05,185
- Selling what?
- Well, stock.

476
00:32:05,310 --> 00:32:07,312
Uh, in a big industrial concern.

477
00:32:07,437 --> 00:32:09,064
Well, I've got to be there, sis.
It's getting late.

478
00:32:09,189 --> 00:32:11,400
- Good bye.
- Good bye.

479
00:32:11,525 --> 00:32:13,485
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

480
00:32:23,412 --> 00:32:26,248
Step on it, kid.
We're late already.

481
00:33:09,166 --> 00:33:12,043
Now, when you get upstairs,
remember, no talking.

482
00:33:12,169 --> 00:33:14,296
The boss hates a guy
that shoots his mouth off.

483
00:33:14,421 --> 00:33:15,964
You answer questions.

484
00:33:16,089 --> 00:33:17,799
"Yes, sir. No, sir."
Get me?

485
00:33:17,924 --> 00:33:19,217
Yes.

486
00:33:19,342 --> 00:33:21,052
And don't forget the "sir."

487
00:33:21,178 --> 00:33:23,138
- No, sir.
- Right.

488
00:33:43,283 --> 00:33:45,118
- Hello, Wally.
- Hello, Del.

489
00:33:48,288 --> 00:33:49,664
Who's your friend?

490
00:33:49,789 --> 00:33:53,168
Oh, this is Mr. Jordan.
He's a great little guy.

491
00:33:53,293 --> 00:33:55,045
He looks like a nice kid.

492
00:34:17,776 --> 00:34:20,237
Hello, Jake.
Here we are.

493
00:34:41,466 --> 00:34:43,718
This is the kid
I was telling you about.

494
00:35:06,199 --> 00:35:07,242
Your name's Jordan?

495
00:35:07,367 --> 00:35:09,035
Yes.
Uh, yes, sir.

496
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:11,037
Wally says you've got a wide
acquaintance in this town.

497
00:35:11,162 --> 00:35:13,373
I know everybody of any...
Yes, sir, I have.

498
00:35:13,498 --> 00:35:15,875
- Do you talk much?
- Not when it's inconvenient.

499
00:35:16,001 --> 00:35:17,377
- Drink?
- A little.

500
00:35:17,502 --> 00:35:20,338
- Blab when you're soused?
- No. Pass out.

501
00:35:26,386 --> 00:35:27,971
How long
have you known him?

502
00:35:28,096 --> 00:35:30,056
Ever since I've been working
the north side.

503
00:35:30,181 --> 00:35:32,642
He's an old customer of mine
down on his luck.

504
00:35:32,767 --> 00:35:36,187
His father lost his pile in the
crash and kicked the bucket.

505
00:35:36,313 --> 00:35:38,648
Now, listen, this kid knows
all the big shots in town.

506
00:35:38,773 --> 00:35:40,150
All the heavy drinkers.

507
00:35:40,275 --> 00:35:41,860
And he can put enough business
in our way

508
00:35:41,985 --> 00:35:43,903
to make himself
a lot of dough.

509
00:35:44,029 --> 00:35:46,865
To say nothing of the 700
I owe you, Wally —

510
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:48,950
which of course
he's never mentioned.

511
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,789
A lot of those blue bloods
are buying from Ollansky now.

512
00:35:54,914 --> 00:35:56,791
If you can get 'em to switch
to Wally

513
00:35:56,916 --> 00:35:59,252
we'll write the 700
off the books.

514
00:35:59,377 --> 00:36:00,920
Sure I can.

515
00:36:01,046 --> 00:36:02,422
Uh, Wally says
all I have to do —

516
00:36:02,547 --> 00:36:04,883
Yeah. Sit down.

517
00:36:05,008 --> 00:36:06,051
Yes, sir.

518
00:36:14,684 --> 00:36:17,896
Now, listen, kid.
Money talks.

519
00:36:18,021 --> 00:36:20,065
But, remember,
in this business

520
00:36:20,190 --> 00:36:23,109
it's the only thing
that talks.

521
00:36:23,234 --> 00:36:25,153
Now, we don't make a practice
of going outside the gang

522
00:36:25,278 --> 00:36:26,946
to sell a little red eye.

523
00:36:27,072 --> 00:36:29,157
But I'm laying
for this guy Ollansky.

524
00:36:29,282 --> 00:36:32,118
And I'll do anything to cut in
on his trade.

525
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:33,370
Well, I — I...

526
00:36:33,495 --> 00:36:34,996
If we take you on

527
00:36:35,121 --> 00:36:37,457
there's certain rules
of the game you've got to learn.

528
00:36:37,582 --> 00:36:41,503
Keeping your mouth shut's
one of them — the first one.

529
00:36:41,628 --> 00:36:46,257
No matter what happens,
don't talk.

530
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:47,801
Yes, sir.

531
00:36:55,642 --> 00:36:58,561
Hello, Wes?
This is Rod Jordan speaking.

532
00:36:58,687 --> 00:37:00,605
I've got bright news
for you, Wes.

533
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:02,357
You need any liquid refreshment
up at your house?

534
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:04,609
I find I can spare a little
from my own private stock

535
00:37:04,734 --> 00:37:06,528
just to a few close friends.

536
00:37:06,653 --> 00:37:09,406
Well, not too close.

537
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:11,324
Sure.
Absolutely okay.

538
00:37:11,449 --> 00:37:12,992
I've had it analyzed.

539
00:37:15,620 --> 00:37:18,206
Okay, Wes. Two cases.
F-O-B your house.

540
00:37:18,331 --> 00:37:20,542
Alright, Wes.
So long.

541
00:37:20,667 --> 00:37:22,210
That's the way
to hook 'em, kid.

542
00:37:22,335 --> 00:37:24,087
Only take a poke at Ollansky
every now and then.

543
00:37:24,212 --> 00:37:26,715
I wish I knew of some legitimate
business that was this easy.

544
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,383
What? This is
a legitimate business.

545
00:37:28,508 --> 00:37:30,093
Only, we make our own laws.

546
00:37:30,218 --> 00:37:31,928
We don't let any small-town
senator make them for us.

547
00:37:32,053 --> 00:37:33,847
That's the only difference.

548
00:37:33,972 --> 00:37:35,724
I never thought I'd come
to bootlegging for a living.

549
00:37:35,849 --> 00:37:37,976
What's the matter
with bootlegging?

550
00:37:38,101 --> 00:37:39,894
What's the difference
whether you buy or sell?

551
00:37:40,019 --> 00:37:41,938
You're equally as guilty
in the eyes of the law.

552
00:37:42,063 --> 00:37:45,608
Only, here you make the dough
instead of spending it.

553
00:37:45,734 --> 00:37:47,068
That's where you're wise.

554
00:37:47,193 --> 00:37:48,903
Yeah. Say,
how do you spell Schneider?

555
00:37:49,028 --> 00:37:50,572
S-H, S-C-H, or S-N-I?

556
00:37:50,697 --> 00:37:53,283
Battle that out for yourself.
I've got a call to make.

557
00:38:01,207 --> 00:38:03,960
Don't forget what I told you
about Ollansky.

558
00:38:04,085 --> 00:38:05,712
He's selling poison.

559
00:38:05,837 --> 00:38:07,422
Okay. Goodbye.

560
00:38:07,547 --> 00:38:09,507
So long.

561
00:38:14,095 --> 00:38:15,430
Come in.

562
00:38:17,265 --> 00:38:19,893
- Hello, Bob.
- Hello, Rod.

563
00:38:21,811 --> 00:38:24,063
I was going to call you.
You're looking fine.

564
00:38:24,189 --> 00:38:26,149
Yeah?
Well, I don't feel it.

565
00:38:26,274 --> 00:38:28,067
Got a touch of jaundice
or something.

566
00:38:28,193 --> 00:38:30,361
Spring fever.
I don't know what.

567
00:38:30,487 --> 00:38:31,613
Have a drink.

568
00:38:38,119 --> 00:38:39,871
No, no, thanks.
Not for me.

569
00:38:39,996 --> 00:38:42,457
Gee, I wanted you to try this.
It's great stuff.

570
00:38:42,582 --> 00:38:45,084
Say, what's become
of Bonnie?

571
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:46,711
I know you two
don't go out much,

572
00:38:46,836 --> 00:38:49,464
but why doesn't she
let me hear from her?

573
00:38:49,589 --> 00:38:50,840
What's she doing
with herself?

574
00:38:50,965 --> 00:38:52,801
Well, you know us
"woiking goils."

575
00:38:52,926 --> 00:38:54,844
Oh, Bonnie?
Working?

576
00:38:54,969 --> 00:38:57,138
Yep.
Bonnie's got a job.

577
00:38:57,263 --> 00:38:58,306
Doing what? Where?

578
00:38:58,431 --> 00:39:00,141
She doesn't want anyone
to know.

579
00:39:00,266 --> 00:39:02,435
Oh, Rod.

580
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:05,021
I want to see Bonnie.
I've missed her.

581
00:39:05,146 --> 00:39:07,190
Everywhere I go,
the party's dead.

582
00:39:07,315 --> 00:39:09,859
I don't believe I'd look her up
if I were you.

583
00:39:09,984 --> 00:39:12,821
Just between ourselves,
Bonnie is sort of off the bunch.

584
00:39:12,946 --> 00:39:14,280
- Well, why?
- I don't know.

585
00:39:14,405 --> 00:39:16,074
She thinks
they rather let her down.

586
00:39:16,199 --> 00:39:19,702
Bonnie's got a lot of pride,
you know?

587
00:39:19,828 --> 00:39:21,996
Oh.

588
00:39:22,121 --> 00:39:24,499
Well, if you won't tell me
where she is

589
00:39:24,624 --> 00:39:26,960
I'll find out some other way.

590
00:39:27,085 --> 00:39:30,338
Oh, tell her I was asking
about her, will you?

591
00:39:30,463 --> 00:39:33,383
Sure.
But what's your hurry?

592
00:39:33,508 --> 00:39:35,927
I have a little favor
I was just about to do for you.

593
00:39:36,052 --> 00:39:37,637
- Me?
- Yeah.

594
00:39:37,762 --> 00:39:39,347
Say, how's your liquor
holding out?

595
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:41,975
I find I can spare a little
of my own private stock

596
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,852
just to accommodate
a few close friends.

597
00:39:43,977 --> 00:39:45,061
Well...

598
00:39:45,186 --> 00:39:46,771
Who you been buying from?
Ollansky?

599
00:39:46,896 --> 00:39:49,190
Lay off that guy.
He's selling poison.

600
00:39:49,315 --> 00:39:51,025
Baxter's the only one
to buy from.

601
00:39:51,150 --> 00:39:54,153
His stuff's not cut.
You ought to try it.

602
00:39:54,279 --> 00:39:56,781
If you're sure
you can spare a little.

603
00:39:56,906 --> 00:39:58,199
I can use a dozen quarts
of Scotch.

604
00:39:58,324 --> 00:39:59,742
Fine. I'll have Wally
call you up.

605
00:39:59,868 --> 00:40:01,119
Alright, fine.

606
00:40:01,244 --> 00:40:02,871
You'll come again,
won't you, Bob?

607
00:40:02,996 --> 00:40:04,330
I'm living alone here
at the club,

608
00:40:04,455 --> 00:40:05,915
and I'll be glad
to see you anytime.

609
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:08,001
Sure, I'll be around.

610
00:40:08,126 --> 00:40:09,961
- So long, Bob.
- Bye.

611
00:40:20,054 --> 00:40:22,807
Just to a few close friends,
Schneider.

612
00:40:22,932 --> 00:40:25,560
Well, not too close.

613
00:40:25,685 --> 00:40:28,062
Sure, absolutely okay.

614
00:40:28,187 --> 00:40:30,231
I've had it analyzed.

615
00:40:33,401 --> 00:40:35,695
- Bert...
- Boy?

616
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,821
Yeah?

617
00:40:36,946 --> 00:40:39,824
How many L's
in "parallel"?

618
00:40:39,949 --> 00:40:41,784
Six or seven.

619
00:40:41,910 --> 00:40:44,746
You should get yourself
a headache.

620
00:40:44,871 --> 00:40:47,832
That's what those dumb eggs
on the copydesk are for.

621
00:40:49,709 --> 00:40:50,752
What the "ell"?

622
00:40:50,877 --> 00:40:52,253
Oh, stop.

623
00:40:52,378 --> 00:40:55,256
What have they pinned on you
now, sister?

624
00:40:55,381 --> 00:40:57,175
Oh, gang stuff.

625
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,843
Holy gee.

626
00:40:58,968 --> 00:41:01,220
So, you're doing
the racket, too.

627
00:41:01,346 --> 00:41:04,766
Woman,
I takes off me hat to ya.

628
00:41:04,891 --> 00:41:06,851
- Where is it?
- There it is.

629
00:41:06,976 --> 00:41:08,937
The crack still goes.

630
00:41:20,073 --> 00:41:21,866
Where's the other 12 pages?

631
00:41:21,991 --> 00:41:23,326
All boiled down to one.

632
00:41:23,451 --> 00:41:24,869
You wouldn't kid me,
would you, mister?

633
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:26,746
I would if I could, lady.

634
00:41:28,247 --> 00:41:30,625
Parker talking.
Make it snappy.

635
00:41:30,750 --> 00:41:32,001
That right?

636
00:41:32,126 --> 00:41:34,337
Seven shot down
in a garage, eh?

637
00:41:34,462 --> 00:41:36,714
Good stuff!
Hold the line.

638
00:41:36,839 --> 00:41:39,008
Hey, Tom, Smith,
Scranton, Curtis!

639
00:41:39,133 --> 00:41:40,468
Just a minute.

640
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:42,303
Hudson's on the wire.
Hot gang-war story.

641
00:41:42,428 --> 00:41:43,471
- Go get it, Curtis.
- Okay.

642
00:41:43,596 --> 00:41:45,098
Curtis is on the way.

643
00:41:45,223 --> 00:41:47,183
Tom, get over to that garage
and get some pictures.

644
00:41:47,308 --> 00:41:48,935
Smith, get everything
we have in our morgue

645
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:50,311
on the Ollansky gang.

646
00:41:50,436 --> 00:41:52,772
Dig up all the pictures
you can find.

647
00:41:52,897 --> 00:41:55,358
Scranton, greatest
gang-war story in months.

648
00:41:55,483 --> 00:41:58,277
Seven of the Ollansky gang lined
up against the wall in a garage

649
00:41:58,403 --> 00:42:00,029
and mowed down
with machine guns.

650
00:42:00,154 --> 00:42:01,322
Nice work, eh?

651
00:42:01,447 --> 00:42:02,865
Sounds like
some of Luva's work.

652
00:42:02,991 --> 00:42:04,242
You know,
Ollansky's been cutting in

653
00:42:04,367 --> 00:42:05,910
on his pet territory lately.

654
00:42:06,035 --> 00:42:08,079
Breeze down on the street
and see what you can pick up.

655
00:42:08,204 --> 00:42:09,497
- This ought to be hot stuff.
- Alright.

656
00:42:09,622 --> 00:42:11,124
I'll take a run
down to his joint.

657
00:42:11,249 --> 00:42:12,750
I'll nose around
a little bit.

658
00:42:12,875 --> 00:42:15,503
You know, I'm getting to be
quite a schnozzler.

659
00:42:15,628 --> 00:42:17,338
Can I do something?

660
00:42:17,463 --> 00:42:19,048
You'll have to cover the morgue
for me, Miss Jordan.

661
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:21,009
Some of the dead men's
wives and sweeties

662
00:42:21,134 --> 00:42:23,177
may drop in
to see the mangled remains.

663
00:42:25,138 --> 00:42:28,391
- The morgue?
- I mean the real morgue.

664
00:42:28,516 --> 00:42:31,019
Yeah, I heard you.

665
00:42:34,147 --> 00:42:35,690
Parker talking.
Make it snappy.

666
00:42:35,815 --> 00:42:38,192
Clinton talking.

667
00:42:38,317 --> 00:42:42,071
Statement from the chief
on the Ollansky slaughter.

668
00:42:42,196 --> 00:42:45,700
Quote, "This wholesale,
cold-blooded murder

669
00:42:45,825 --> 00:42:47,910
of seven of the Ollansky gang

670
00:42:48,036 --> 00:42:51,080
is undoubtedly the work
of rival gangsters."

671
00:42:51,205 --> 00:42:53,833
Yeah, ain't that smart?

672
00:42:53,958 --> 00:42:56,294
Quote, "We have
a definite suspicion

673
00:42:56,419 --> 00:43:00,173
as to the guilty party
and arrests..."

674
00:43:00,298 --> 00:43:01,883
Huh?

675
00:43:02,008 --> 00:43:05,845
Well, who says
we've got to be original?

676
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:07,847
What?

677
00:43:07,972 --> 00:43:09,766
Well, the same to you.

678
00:43:19,901 --> 00:43:22,236
And then we lined 'em up,
face against a wall.

679
00:43:22,361 --> 00:43:24,030
Nobody says nothin'.

680
00:43:24,155 --> 00:43:25,865
And one of the guys,
Wilkinson, calls out,

681
00:43:25,990 --> 00:43:27,742
"For jeez sake,
give us a break, will ya?"

682
00:43:27,867 --> 00:43:30,703
Whitey here says, "Yeah.
We'll give you a break."

683
00:43:30,828 --> 00:43:32,580
And we turns on the hose,

684
00:43:32,705 --> 00:43:35,666
and they go down like a row
of ducks in a shooting gallery.

685
00:43:37,001 --> 00:43:38,586
Clean getaway?

686
00:43:38,711 --> 00:43:40,797
Clean as a snowbird.

687
00:43:40,922 --> 00:43:43,257
Except one of these nibs over
there took sick at the wheel

688
00:43:43,382 --> 00:43:45,426
and I had to change places
and drive.

689
00:43:47,386 --> 00:43:50,515
Sick, eh?
What did you go along for?

690
00:43:53,392 --> 00:43:55,061
I didn't know what it was.

691
00:43:55,186 --> 00:43:57,146
I thought we were
just going on a hijacking.

692
00:43:57,271 --> 00:44:01,192
I didn't know
there was going to be... gunplay.

693
00:44:01,317 --> 00:44:02,860
I was driving,
and Whitey said

694
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:05,613
"Turn into this garage,
and keep the motor running."

695
00:44:05,738 --> 00:44:09,492
I sat at the wheel
and saw the whole thing.

696
00:44:12,411 --> 00:44:14,455
I didn't realize what was
happening till it was all over.

697
00:44:14,580 --> 00:44:17,125
Then I got sick.

698
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,709
I couldn't help it.

699
00:44:25,883 --> 00:44:29,262
I'll be alright now.
I'll be alright.

700
00:44:29,387 --> 00:44:31,139
All I need
is a couple of drinks.

701
00:44:31,264 --> 00:44:33,307
That's all I need.

702
00:44:33,432 --> 00:44:35,977
Just a little something
in my stomach.

703
00:45:06,465 --> 00:45:09,177
It's a great joint, ain't it?

704
00:45:09,302 --> 00:45:12,096
Sure, great.

705
00:45:12,221 --> 00:45:14,182
Hey, do you know Luva?

706
00:45:14,307 --> 00:45:16,142
What's it to ya?

707
00:45:16,267 --> 00:45:17,768
Oh, nothing.

708
00:45:17,894 --> 00:45:19,395
I was just wondering.

709
00:45:23,316 --> 00:45:27,570
I'm Eddie Burke.
Outside man for Luva.

710
00:45:27,695 --> 00:45:29,405
Oh.

711
00:45:32,116 --> 00:45:33,868
You're new to this racket.

712
00:45:33,993 --> 00:45:36,621
- I ain't seen you before.
- Who said I was?

713
00:45:36,746 --> 00:45:38,206
Oh, boy,
wasn't that a hot session

714
00:45:38,331 --> 00:45:39,582
down at that garage
this evening?

715
00:45:39,707 --> 00:45:40,750
Shh.

716
00:45:47,006 --> 00:45:48,758
There's no dicks
in the joint.

717
00:45:48,883 --> 00:45:52,261
If there was,
I'd tip you off.

718
00:45:52,386 --> 00:45:54,513
I was lookout man
across the street

719
00:45:54,639 --> 00:45:56,224
and I heard the spray.

720
00:46:01,229 --> 00:46:02,855
You know,
the people on the street

721
00:46:02,980 --> 00:46:04,732
didn't seem to pay
any attention to it.

722
00:46:04,857 --> 00:46:08,110
They thought it was a motorcycle
just starting up.

723
00:46:08,236 --> 00:46:10,154
But I knew what it was.

724
00:46:10,279 --> 00:46:13,741
When the car came out,
I beat it.

725
00:46:13,866 --> 00:46:16,077
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

726
00:46:16,202 --> 00:46:18,412
What part of the job
did you handle, kid?

727
00:46:18,537 --> 00:46:20,498
I was driving.

728
00:46:20,623 --> 00:46:21,958
Oh.

729
00:46:27,046 --> 00:46:30,383
You were going so fast
I couldn't recognize you.

730
00:46:30,508 --> 00:46:32,969
But I thought
I saw Whitey Lucas.

731
00:46:33,094 --> 00:46:34,553
Who else was along?

732
00:46:37,848 --> 00:46:40,226
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, kid.

733
00:46:53,489 --> 00:46:55,783
- What do I owe ya, Oscar?
- One dollar.

734
00:46:55,908 --> 00:46:58,577
- Okay. See ya later.
- Yes, sir.

735
00:46:58,703 --> 00:47:01,414
Hello, newshound.
How's it coming?

736
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:02,832
Hello, Whitey.
How's the racket?

737
00:47:02,957 --> 00:47:05,126
- Fine, how's yours?
- Oh, same old grind.

738
00:47:05,251 --> 00:47:06,794
Say, I got a great story
tonight, though.

739
00:47:06,919 --> 00:47:08,462
Somebody shot up
that Ollansky gang.

740
00:47:08,587 --> 00:47:09,797
Oh, yeah.
I heard about it.

741
00:47:09,922 --> 00:47:11,299
- Yeah.
- Have a drink.

742
00:47:11,424 --> 00:47:13,759
No, I got to get
back to the office.

743
00:47:13,884 --> 00:47:15,177
Wait a minute.
What's your hurry?

744
00:47:15,303 --> 00:47:17,346
I think
you better have one.

745
00:47:17,471 --> 00:47:21,475
Well, okay, but just one.

746
00:47:21,600 --> 00:47:23,394
- Same thing.
- Yeah. Make it two.

747
00:47:23,519 --> 00:47:25,438
What I said
didn't mean anything.

748
00:47:25,563 --> 00:47:27,106
He didn't notice.

749
00:47:27,231 --> 00:47:28,983
I didn't mean
to do anything wrong.

750
00:47:29,108 --> 00:47:31,485
- I didn't know.
- Talk, will ya?

751
00:47:31,610 --> 00:47:34,030
What did I tell you
about that?

752
00:47:37,908 --> 00:47:40,786
I didn't know who he was,
I tell you.

753
00:47:40,911 --> 00:47:42,705
He said he was Eddie Burke,
your outside man.

754
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:44,915
He said he was in the street
by the garage.

755
00:47:45,041 --> 00:47:46,375
You...

756
00:47:52,256 --> 00:47:53,632
Scranton still there?

757
00:47:57,386 --> 00:47:58,346
He's at the bar
with Whitey.

758
00:47:58,471 --> 00:47:59,889
I know that guy.

759
00:48:00,014 --> 00:48:01,349
He'll go straight to his paper
with the story

760
00:48:01,474 --> 00:48:02,933
and send it to the cops.

761
00:48:03,059 --> 00:48:05,394
If he gets to his office,
it's a blow off.

762
00:48:05,519 --> 00:48:08,522
That's easy.
He don't get to his office.

763
00:48:08,647 --> 00:48:12,193
We can't let him have it here,
and he's too wise to frame.

764
00:48:12,318 --> 00:48:15,529
He'll walk to the subway
at the corner, and...

765
00:48:15,654 --> 00:48:17,823
And you'll meet him there,
Jordan.

766
00:48:17,948 --> 00:48:19,283
- Me?
- Yes, you.

767
00:48:19,408 --> 00:48:22,286
- W-What for?
- Slim, give the kid your rod.

768
00:48:22,411 --> 00:48:24,038
No. No!

769
00:48:24,163 --> 00:48:25,664
I'm not...
I can't.

770
00:48:25,790 --> 00:48:27,083
Take that gun!

771
00:48:30,169 --> 00:48:33,422
Now, listen close,
because I don't repeat myself.

772
00:48:33,547 --> 00:48:36,092
You got us into this jam,
and you're going to get us out.

773
00:48:36,217 --> 00:48:38,677
You're going to meet this bird
at the subway entrance

774
00:48:38,803 --> 00:48:40,721
and you're going
to let him have it.

775
00:48:40,846 --> 00:48:42,306
I can't. I can't!

776
00:48:42,431 --> 00:48:43,766
You guys scatter
along the block.

777
00:48:43,891 --> 00:48:46,227
Slim, you and Emilio
take Jordan in the car

778
00:48:46,352 --> 00:48:48,062
and stall near the subway.

779
00:48:48,187 --> 00:48:51,232
If Jordan lets Scranton take one
step down that subway entrance,

780
00:48:51,357 --> 00:48:53,150
give them both the works.

781
00:48:53,275 --> 00:48:54,235
Get me?

782
00:48:54,360 --> 00:48:57,113
- Alright, boss.
- Okay.

783
00:48:57,238 --> 00:48:58,531
You understand this deal,
don't you?

784
00:48:58,656 --> 00:48:59,782
Listen, I —

785
00:48:59,907 --> 00:49:01,242
Slim will be ready
at the wheel.

786
00:49:01,367 --> 00:49:02,451
When you give Scranton
the works,

787
00:49:02,576 --> 00:49:03,911
jump in the car,
and you're off.

788
00:49:04,036 --> 00:49:05,704
It's murder.
It's murder!

789
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:08,374
If you don't come through,
there will be a double murder.

790
00:49:08,499 --> 00:49:10,334
Oh, I can't, I tell you.
I can't!

791
00:49:10,459 --> 00:49:11,919
Stand on your feet.

792
00:49:14,213 --> 00:49:15,631
Now get going.

793
00:49:30,896 --> 00:49:34,108
Well, I got to blow.
See you later, Whitey.

794
00:49:34,233 --> 00:49:35,484
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

795
00:49:35,609 --> 00:49:37,611
Have just
another little one.

796
00:49:37,736 --> 00:49:39,572
I'll finish this one.

797
00:49:46,745 --> 00:49:48,247
Sure you won't have
any more, huh?

798
00:49:48,372 --> 00:49:51,208
I'm late now.
I got to be stepping.

799
00:49:52,626 --> 00:49:56,547
So long, Bert.
See you some more.

800
00:49:56,672 --> 00:49:58,215
So long, Whitey.

801
00:50:06,765 --> 00:50:09,810
- Hello, Scranton.
- Hiya, Lefty.

802
00:50:13,063 --> 00:50:15,983
- Howdy, boy.
- Okay by me, kid.

803
00:50:16,108 --> 00:50:17,860
Hiya, Bert.

804
00:50:20,112 --> 00:50:21,238
Hi, Scranton.

805
00:50:21,363 --> 00:50:22,656
Hello, kid.
Hi, Jack.

806
00:50:22,781 --> 00:50:24,074
Swell night for a walk,
huh, Bert?

807
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:25,993
Yeah.

808
00:50:28,704 --> 00:50:30,039
Hi, newshound.

809
00:50:30,164 --> 00:50:33,417
Hiya, Wally.
How's everything?

810
00:50:33,542 --> 00:50:36,378
- Okay.
- Same here.

811
00:50:51,143 --> 00:50:52,645
Why, hello, kid.

812
00:51:05,783 --> 00:51:09,078
He's killed! He's shot!
Somebody shot him!

813
00:51:28,180 --> 00:51:29,473
Boy?

814
00:51:58,961 --> 00:52:00,963
You're holding three
of Luva's men?

815
00:52:01,088 --> 00:52:02,506
Who are they?

816
00:52:02,631 --> 00:52:05,092
Wally Baxter.

817
00:52:05,217 --> 00:52:07,511
What's that?
Righty?

818
00:52:07,636 --> 00:52:09,638
Oh, Whitey.

819
00:52:09,763 --> 00:52:11,765
Who's the other one?

820
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,352
The chief says they all claim
they can furnish alibis.

821
00:52:15,477 --> 00:52:17,062
Well, Blair's offering $25,000

822
00:52:17,187 --> 00:52:18,939
for the capture of the man
that fired the shot.

823
00:52:19,064 --> 00:52:20,190
Now go to it.

824
00:52:20,316 --> 00:52:21,609
The police
are a big help.

825
00:52:21,734 --> 00:52:23,902
It's up to us, boys.
They haven't got a clue.

826
00:52:24,028 --> 00:52:26,155
Of course, Jake Luva's
back of this, but prove it.

827
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:27,740
Well, I'm willing
to risk my neck

828
00:52:27,865 --> 00:52:29,575
to run down the mucker
that did the shooting.

829
00:52:29,700 --> 00:52:31,910
I'd join the police force
or anything.

830
00:52:32,036 --> 00:52:34,121
But what's the use?
We're too well known.

831
00:52:34,246 --> 00:52:36,498
They'd spot us,
the newspapermen, in a minute.

832
00:52:36,624 --> 00:52:37,791
Yes, that's just the trouble.

833
00:52:37,916 --> 00:52:39,293
Now, we've got to
get Luva sometime,

834
00:52:39,418 --> 00:52:41,503
and now's the time
to do it.

835
00:52:41,629 --> 00:52:43,631
I know!
That Jordan girl.

836
00:52:43,756 --> 00:52:45,049
- Bonnie Jordan?
- Sure.

837
00:52:45,174 --> 00:52:47,217
Nobody knows
she's working on the paper.

838
00:52:47,343 --> 00:52:50,012
And they'd never suspect
a girl.

839
00:52:50,137 --> 00:52:51,305
Go get her.

840
00:52:51,430 --> 00:52:53,223
By George,
I think I've hit on it.

841
00:52:53,349 --> 00:52:56,143
Now, remember, we never saw
this girl before, any of us.

842
00:52:56,268 --> 00:52:58,020
- Get that?
- Right.

843
00:52:58,145 --> 00:52:59,813
You tip the others off and then
go back to the police station.

844
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:01,607
Bring in anything you can,
but make it snappy.

845
00:53:01,732 --> 00:53:03,192
Come on, boys, let's get
back to headquarters.

846
00:53:03,317 --> 00:53:04,485
Okay.

847
00:53:08,405 --> 00:53:10,532
- Hello, Bonnie.
- Hello.

848
00:53:11,742 --> 00:53:12,785
Sit down.

849
00:53:16,121 --> 00:53:18,540
I've been hearing very
complimentary things of you.

850
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:19,708
Thank you.

851
00:53:19,833 --> 00:53:21,585
Miss Jordan,
how's your nerve?

852
00:53:21,710 --> 00:53:23,587
Haven't any.
Why?

853
00:53:23,712 --> 00:53:26,215
I want to find out
who killed Bert Scranton.

854
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:29,343
And I'll do it
if I have to break the paper.

855
00:53:29,468 --> 00:53:30,678
You want to tackle it?

856
00:53:30,803 --> 00:53:32,429
- I'm aching to.
- Good.

857
00:53:32,554 --> 00:53:36,016
Now, listen, we think
Jake Luva's back of this.

858
00:53:36,141 --> 00:53:38,519
Luva pulled the
Ollansky killings. Must have.

859
00:53:38,644 --> 00:53:39,895
Now, Bert was on the trail.

860
00:53:40,020 --> 00:53:41,772
Possibly had a hot tip,
and they knew it.

861
00:53:41,897 --> 00:53:43,607
Now, if Luva's back
of the Ollansky killing

862
00:53:43,732 --> 00:53:45,526
then he's back
of Scranton's murder.

863
00:53:45,651 --> 00:53:47,194
- Logical, isn't it?
- Of course.

864
00:53:47,319 --> 00:53:50,948
Listen, you're not
Bonnie Jordan. You never were.

865
00:53:51,073 --> 00:53:54,368
You're Mary Smith,
a tough girl from Missouri.

866
00:53:54,493 --> 00:53:55,994
You never saw a newspaper.

867
00:53:56,120 --> 00:53:58,122
You're a cheap mow
in the underworld.

868
00:53:58,247 --> 00:54:00,874
You hang around nightclubs,
especially Luva's.

869
00:54:00,999 --> 00:54:03,377
You get to know him.
You drink with him.

870
00:54:03,502 --> 00:54:04,920
Use any weapon you've got.

871
00:54:05,045 --> 00:54:08,674
Only, get to know this man
and know him well.

872
00:54:15,681 --> 00:54:17,266
Alright.

873
00:54:17,391 --> 00:54:19,935
Nothing I wouldn't do
to find out who killed Bert.

874
00:54:20,060 --> 00:54:21,895
It's a dangerous game,
Bonnie.

875
00:54:22,020 --> 00:54:24,148
No child's play,
you know.

876
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,901
I'm not afraid.

877
00:54:28,026 --> 00:54:30,904
Then you find out
who killed my best reporter.

878
00:54:31,029 --> 00:54:33,323
And if you come in
with the story...

879
00:54:34,867 --> 00:54:36,577
you can have the paper.

880
00:54:36,702 --> 00:54:38,370
We'll give it to you.

881
00:54:57,848 --> 00:54:59,349
I see where
The Star's offering

882
00:54:59,475 --> 00:55:02,060
40 grand for the
capture of...

883
00:55:02,186 --> 00:55:04,646
well, whoever killed
their best reporter.

884
00:55:04,772 --> 00:55:06,315
Yeah.
Can you beat it?

885
00:55:06,440 --> 00:55:08,942
As if there ain't enough
reporters in the world already.

886
00:55:09,067 --> 00:55:11,069
They offer any more
for that young punk's skin,

887
00:55:11,195 --> 00:55:14,448
I'll be tempted
to turn him over.

888
00:55:14,573 --> 00:55:17,451
Remember now, Jordan should
stay away from this joint

889
00:55:17,576 --> 00:55:19,119
fill all this hullabaloo
dies down.

890
00:55:19,244 --> 00:55:21,288
- You hear me?
- Yeah. I told him.

891
00:55:21,413 --> 00:55:23,707
He's laying low
like a scared rabbit.

892
00:55:23,832 --> 00:55:26,001
He's afraid to show his face
in the light.

893
00:55:28,212 --> 00:55:30,839
Oh, uh, you sure
none of the boys broke

894
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:32,174
when they grilled them
at the station?

895
00:55:32,299 --> 00:55:33,842
Certainly not.
We're all out, ain't we?

896
00:55:33,967 --> 00:55:35,636
All but Wally.

897
00:55:35,761 --> 00:55:37,513
That will take a little fixing.

898
00:55:37,638 --> 00:55:40,557
But I'll have him out tonight.

899
00:55:40,682 --> 00:55:42,267
- Slide over, will you?
- No. I'll scram.

900
00:55:42,392 --> 00:55:43,644
I'll see you later.

901
00:55:43,769 --> 00:55:45,687
- Hello, Della.
- Hello, Whitey.

902
00:55:45,813 --> 00:55:48,190
- Oh, is that an encore?
- No, sit down.

903
00:55:54,071 --> 00:55:56,031
That's my new cabaret number.

904
00:55:58,742 --> 00:56:00,285
Your new number, huh?

905
00:56:08,293 --> 00:56:11,296
Oh, so, that's what's become
of Bonnie.

906
00:56:11,421 --> 00:56:13,757
Oh, Sylvia!

907
00:57:30,292 --> 00:57:31,543
Phew!

908
00:57:49,102 --> 00:57:51,688
That will be all, Alice.
You can go home now.

909
00:58:07,871 --> 00:58:09,039
Slim.

910
00:58:11,959 --> 00:58:14,336
- Buy Della a drink, will ya?
- Why, sure.

911
00:58:28,016 --> 00:58:30,102
Let go of my arm!

912
00:58:49,788 --> 00:58:51,832
- Gee, you're a cute kid.
- Yeah?

913
00:58:56,878 --> 00:58:58,296
How'd the number go over
tonight?

914
00:58:58,422 --> 00:59:01,008
- Couldn't be better.
- Good.

915
00:59:01,133 --> 00:59:04,219
- You got me going, sister.
- Can I depend on it?

916
00:59:04,344 --> 00:59:06,263
In a big way.

917
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:13,020
You know,
this is my joint.

918
00:59:31,329 --> 00:59:33,290
You know,
I feel terribly proud.

919
00:59:33,415 --> 00:59:35,792
You should.
You got a big hand.

920
00:59:35,917 --> 00:59:37,878
I mean
to be dancing with you.

921
00:59:38,003 --> 00:59:40,213
Why, you're the owner
of this nightclub.

922
00:59:40,338 --> 00:59:43,842
Ah. I own more
than this little joint, I hope.

923
00:59:43,967 --> 00:59:45,969
You do?

924
00:59:46,094 --> 00:59:47,971
You're going to have
a little supper with me tonight.

925
00:59:48,096 --> 00:59:49,848
Upstairs in my room.

926
00:59:49,973 --> 00:59:51,683
We've got to get
better acquainted.

927
00:59:51,808 --> 00:59:54,436
I'd love it.
I'll go and dress now.

928
00:59:54,561 --> 00:59:57,022
- Okay.
- Oh'

929
01:00:11,203 --> 01:00:12,579
Who is it?

930
01:00:12,704 --> 01:00:15,207
It's Bob.
I want to see you.

931
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:31,139
What's the idea
behind all this, Bonnie?

932
01:00:31,264 --> 01:00:34,226
I don't see how that could
possibly concern you.

933
01:00:34,351 --> 01:00:35,769
Did you have to come to this?

934
01:00:35,894 --> 01:00:38,313
Yes, I did.

935
01:00:43,360 --> 01:00:44,778
Why didn't you let me know?

936
01:00:44,903 --> 01:00:47,114
And what would you have done
for me if I had?

937
01:00:47,239 --> 01:00:50,325
- Well, I...
- That's just what I thought.

938
01:00:54,704 --> 01:00:58,208
Would you mind handing me
that cloak over there, please?

939
01:01:25,110 --> 01:01:26,486
What's the matter?

940
01:01:26,611 --> 01:01:28,238
You've kissed me before,
haven't you?

941
01:01:28,363 --> 01:01:31,575
Yes, but that wasn't
a permanent arrangement, was it?

942
01:01:31,700 --> 01:01:32,868
Aren't you being clever?

943
01:01:32,993 --> 01:01:35,579
And aren't you being vague,
as usual?

944
01:01:37,956 --> 01:01:40,542
Alright,
if that's what you want

945
01:01:40,667 --> 01:01:43,587
I'll set you up in a real
establishment anytime you like.

946
01:01:43,712 --> 01:01:45,213
You don't have to make
your living off Jake Luva

947
01:01:45,338 --> 01:01:47,090
dancing in his nightclub.

948
01:01:47,215 --> 01:01:49,176
I can do much better for you
than that.

949
01:01:49,301 --> 01:01:51,845
Now, is that less vague?

950
01:01:56,057 --> 01:01:58,560
That's very clear.

951
01:01:58,685 --> 01:02:00,770
Now we understand
each other.

952
01:02:00,896 --> 01:02:03,648
I'm a cheap little dancer
in a nightclub

953
01:02:03,773 --> 01:02:06,943
and you thought you could
have me on your own terms.

954
01:02:07,068 --> 01:02:08,570
Well, you're mistaken.

955
01:02:08,695 --> 01:02:11,239
I can still pick my own men,
Mr. Townsend.

956
01:02:11,364 --> 01:02:13,283
And right now,
it's Jake Luva.

957
01:02:13,408 --> 01:02:14,784
Bonnie...

958
01:02:14,910 --> 01:02:16,786
You had your day,
and what did I get out of it?

959
01:02:16,912 --> 01:02:18,455
I offered to marry you.

960
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:21,666
And what a grand and
condescending gesture that was.

961
01:02:21,791 --> 01:02:24,044
You were willing
to do the right thing.

962
01:02:24,169 --> 01:02:27,631
What a perfect gentleman.
And what a fool I was.

963
01:02:34,387 --> 01:02:36,348
I loved you, Bob.

964
01:02:36,473 --> 01:02:38,350
And I thought you loved me.

965
01:02:38,475 --> 01:02:41,519
No, don't touch me.
That's all over.

966
01:02:42,896 --> 01:02:44,731
Nice of you to offer
to be so generous,

967
01:02:44,856 --> 01:02:46,399
but I must be going.

968
01:02:46,524 --> 01:02:48,151
I have a heavy date tonight.

969
01:02:50,612 --> 01:02:53,990
I'm hitting the pace now,
and I like it.

970
01:03:36,116 --> 01:03:39,035
There's your "Moonlight Sonata,"
only not as it was written.

971
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:41,204
I like it better.

972
01:03:49,754 --> 01:03:51,047
Pretty, isn't it?

973
01:04:00,473 --> 01:04:01,641
Like it?

974
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:06,354
I love it.

975
01:04:06,479 --> 01:04:08,690
You know, it's hard to believe
that a girl like you

976
01:04:08,815 --> 01:04:10,233
ever came from Missouri.

977
01:04:10,358 --> 01:04:12,736
Go on!
Missouri's a famous state.

978
01:04:12,861 --> 01:04:14,195
For what?

979
01:04:14,321 --> 01:04:16,698
Lindbergh, Ozark Mountains,
muddy rivers,

980
01:04:16,823 --> 01:04:17,949
pretzels, mules —

981
01:04:18,074 --> 01:04:20,327
And pretty girls.

982
01:04:21,619 --> 01:04:24,372
How'd you happen to hit Chicago
and this racket?

983
01:04:26,374 --> 01:04:30,253
Well, you see,
my father died and...

984
01:04:30,378 --> 01:04:33,757
and a certain young man
I was in love with

985
01:04:33,882 --> 01:04:36,801
wasn't exactly
the marrying kind.

986
01:04:36,926 --> 01:04:39,471
I had to paddle for myself,
so...

987
01:04:40,930 --> 01:04:42,849
I paddled to Chicago.

988
01:04:42,974 --> 01:04:45,602
You know, I liked you the minute
you walked in my office.

989
01:04:45,727 --> 01:04:48,813
I liked you when you said
your name was Mary Smith.

990
01:04:48,938 --> 01:04:51,649
Of course, I knew
that wasn't your real name.

991
01:04:51,775 --> 01:04:53,360
I took you
for a clever little girl

992
01:04:53,485 --> 01:04:55,487
that could pull one over
when she wanted to.

993
01:04:55,612 --> 01:04:58,782
Say, I've heard of Luva's
nightclub even in St. Joe.

994
01:04:58,907 --> 01:05:01,409
Believe me,
you're well known.

995
01:05:01,534 --> 01:05:04,371
I've read all about you.

996
01:05:04,496 --> 01:05:06,289
In the papers.

997
01:05:06,414 --> 01:05:08,750
Yes, I get my share
of publicity

998
01:05:08,875 --> 01:05:10,293
more than I care about.

999
01:05:10,418 --> 01:05:13,296
Well,
why don't you sue them?

1000
01:05:13,421 --> 01:05:15,590
They haven't got a thing
on me.

1001
01:05:15,715 --> 01:05:17,425
No?

1002
01:05:17,550 --> 01:05:20,428
They seem to think they have,

1003
01:05:20,553 --> 01:05:23,264
the way they're playing up
this Scranton case.

1004
01:05:27,435 --> 01:05:29,729
Yeah?

1005
01:05:29,854 --> 01:05:32,941
Well, they're barking up
the wrong tree this time.

1006
01:05:33,066 --> 01:05:37,362
They got to climb to find
the bird that pulled that job.

1007
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:40,240
So don't you worry about me,
Mary.

1008
01:05:42,909 --> 01:05:44,911
Like me?

1009
01:05:45,036 --> 01:05:46,329
What do you think?

1010
01:05:54,212 --> 01:05:55,672
Gonna be nice to me?

1011
01:06:18,278 --> 01:06:19,446
I'll answer.

1012
01:06:25,994 --> 01:06:27,287
Hello?

1013
01:06:27,412 --> 01:06:30,373
Is Mr. Luva there?
I want to talk to him.

1014
01:06:34,502 --> 01:06:35,503
Oh.

1015
01:06:38,923 --> 01:06:39,924
What's the matter?

1016
01:06:41,342 --> 01:06:45,763
Oh.
Somebody's terribly excited.

1017
01:06:45,889 --> 01:06:47,474
It startled me.

1018
01:06:52,312 --> 01:06:53,938
Yes?

1019
01:06:54,063 --> 01:06:57,192
I told you
to stay where you are

1020
01:06:57,317 --> 01:06:59,402
until you heard
from Baxter.

1021
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:01,988
Alright, then do it.

1022
01:07:10,121 --> 01:07:11,247
What is it?

1023
01:07:13,166 --> 01:07:16,085
I just
felt a little faint.

1024
01:07:17,212 --> 01:07:20,965
Would you mind telling me
if that's some of your own?

1025
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:24,677
You don't think
I'd drink bootleg, do you?

1026
01:07:24,802 --> 01:07:26,679
Oh, I need some lipstick.

1027
01:07:26,804 --> 01:07:28,723
My makeup's all worn off.

1028
01:07:33,686 --> 01:07:36,314
You left your purse
in there.

1029
01:07:36,439 --> 01:07:37,440
Thanks.

1030
01:07:47,450 --> 01:07:48,618
Roddy.

1031
01:07:50,495 --> 01:07:51,663
Roddy.

1032
01:08:13,518 --> 01:08:14,519
Who is it?

1033
01:08:14,644 --> 01:08:16,729
Roddy, let me in.

1034
01:08:21,442 --> 01:08:24,320
Well, sis,
what are you doing here?

1035
01:08:24,445 --> 01:08:26,114
Well...

1036
01:08:26,239 --> 01:08:29,742
I had to see you.
I-I hadn't seen you for days.

1037
01:08:29,867 --> 01:08:31,661
I told you I was working.

1038
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:36,749
Yes, working.

1039
01:08:36,874 --> 01:08:38,501
Making a lot of money.

1040
01:08:38,626 --> 01:08:40,712
Sure.
I've been doing fine.

1041
01:08:44,382 --> 01:08:46,384
Roddy.

1042
01:08:46,509 --> 01:08:47,885
Look at me.

1043
01:08:49,387 --> 01:08:52,056
You've never lied to me before
in all your life.

1044
01:08:52,181 --> 01:08:53,558
What do you mean?

1045
01:08:53,683 --> 01:08:55,518
I mean that I was
in Luva's apartment tonight

1046
01:08:55,643 --> 01:08:56,561
when you telephoned.

1047
01:08:56,686 --> 01:08:58,229
You?

1048
01:08:58,354 --> 01:08:59,731
Roddy, what was it?

1049
01:08:59,856 --> 01:09:01,399
What did you want
to talk to him about?

1050
01:09:01,524 --> 01:09:04,444
I-I just wanted a little
something to drink, that's all.

1051
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:07,614
Oh, Roddy,
why do you lie to me?

1052
01:09:07,739 --> 01:09:11,367
Well, what were you doing
in Luva's apartment?

1053
01:09:11,492 --> 01:09:13,453
I've been dancing
in his nightclub,

1054
01:09:13,578 --> 01:09:16,289
working for the paper.

1055
01:09:16,414 --> 01:09:18,666
Trying to find out who —

1056
01:09:18,791 --> 01:09:20,960
who killed Bert Scranton.

1057
01:09:24,088 --> 01:09:26,966
Roddy.
Roddy, why did you do it?

1058
01:09:27,091 --> 01:09:29,385
- Why did you do it?
- I had to.

1059
01:09:29,510 --> 01:09:31,262
They trained their guns on me,
Bonnie.

1060
01:09:31,387 --> 01:09:33,640
I talked.
Scranton had the goods on us.

1061
01:09:33,765 --> 01:09:35,516
Oh, I wish I'd died first.

1062
01:09:35,642 --> 01:09:38,311
I can't sleep.
I'm going crazy.

1063
01:09:38,436 --> 01:09:40,104
All night long,
I keep seeing that man's face

1064
01:09:40,229 --> 01:09:43,232
the way he smiled
and spoke to me before I...

1065
01:09:43,358 --> 01:09:46,527
Oh, Bonnie.
don't look at me that way.

1066
01:09:46,653 --> 01:09:48,154
Don't, Bonnie!

1067
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:08,216
Where are you going?

1068
01:10:08,341 --> 01:10:10,885
What does it matter now?

1069
01:10:13,221 --> 01:10:15,056
You're not going
to give me up, Bon.

1070
01:10:15,181 --> 01:10:16,683
Bon, you wouldn't.

1071
01:10:16,808 --> 01:10:18,393
Listen, Bon,
don't give me up.

1072
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:20,561
I didn't mean to do it.
You mustn't let them take me.

1073
01:10:20,687 --> 01:10:23,147
I can't stand it.
I can't go to jail.

1074
01:10:23,272 --> 01:10:26,693
They'll hang me.
I don't want to die.

1075
01:10:26,818 --> 01:10:29,362
I don't want to die.

1076
01:10:30,738 --> 01:10:33,199
Don't be afraid, Roddy.

1077
01:10:33,324 --> 01:10:35,868
You'll be alright.

1078
01:10:35,993 --> 01:10:38,329
We'll think of something.

1079
01:10:38,454 --> 01:10:41,457
Sure. Sure.

1080
01:10:41,582 --> 01:10:43,292
We'll think of something.

1081
01:11:44,061 --> 01:11:46,939
Take it easy now,
and don't make a sound.

1082
01:11:49,817 --> 01:11:53,404
Thought you'd get away with it,
didn't you, Miss Jordan?

1083
01:11:53,529 --> 01:11:56,282
Yes.
How do, Miss Jordan?

1084
01:11:56,407 --> 01:11:58,159
Too bad I happened to be driving
into that alley

1085
01:11:58,284 --> 01:12:00,953
when you slid off
of that fire escape.

1086
01:12:01,078 --> 01:12:04,248
Yeah, just too bad.

1087
01:12:04,373 --> 01:12:06,834
Fond of adventure,
aren't you, Miss Jordan?

1088
01:12:06,959 --> 01:12:08,711
A clever little girl

1089
01:12:08,836 --> 01:12:11,172
who could put one over
when she tried.

1090
01:12:11,297 --> 01:12:12,924
Almost.

1091
01:12:13,049 --> 01:12:15,802
You've read about me
in the papers.

1092
01:12:15,927 --> 01:12:18,304
Write for 'em, too,
don't you?

1093
01:12:18,429 --> 01:12:21,182
- Yes, I do.
- Not anymore you don't.

1094
01:12:21,307 --> 01:12:24,310
We're gonna take you
for a pleasant little ride.

1095
01:12:24,435 --> 01:12:28,314
And that brother of yours
who also likes to yap so well.

1096
01:12:28,439 --> 01:12:30,483
He's gonna get his too.

1097
01:12:31,776 --> 01:12:33,402
You've made
a murderer out of him.

1098
01:12:33,528 --> 01:12:35,154
Aren't you satisfied?

1099
01:12:35,279 --> 01:12:36,531
Get going, Wally.

1100
01:12:52,547 --> 01:12:54,423
Wait for me.
I won't be a minute.

1101
01:12:55,842 --> 01:12:58,344
You're gonna walk out
of this room and get in my car.

1102
01:12:58,469 --> 01:13:00,429
If you turn your head
or try to speak to anybody,

1103
01:13:00,555 --> 01:13:03,224
well, you know
what you're walking with.

1104
01:13:03,349 --> 01:13:06,227
- Brave, aren't you?
- Yeah.

1105
01:13:14,652 --> 01:13:15,736
It's the kid.

1106
01:13:20,032 --> 01:13:22,326
Bonnie? Bonnie?

1107
01:13:28,583 --> 01:13:30,042
Bonnie?

1108
01:13:30,167 --> 01:13:31,711
- Stick 'em up!
- What's the idea?

1109
01:13:31,836 --> 01:13:33,379
Couple of
newspaper framers, eh?

1110
01:13:33,504 --> 01:13:34,630
We haven't been
doing anything.

1111
01:13:34,755 --> 01:13:36,048
And you won't.

1112
01:13:37,133 --> 01:13:39,302
Thought you'd take it
on the run, eh?

1113
01:13:39,427 --> 01:13:40,678
Trying to slip out of town,
I guess.

1114
01:13:40,803 --> 01:13:42,263
Now, look here, Jake —

1115
01:13:42,388 --> 01:13:44,265
There's nothing you can say
that I want to hear.

1116
01:13:44,390 --> 01:13:46,767
Now, listen, Jordan,
head for that door.

1117
01:13:46,893 --> 01:13:48,603
Keep your arms down
and walk straight ahead

1118
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:50,813
with that sister of yours.

1119
01:13:50,938 --> 01:13:53,858
Get him, Rod!
Get him!

1120
01:14:05,244 --> 01:14:07,246
Roddy.

1121
01:14:07,371 --> 01:14:08,873
Roddy.

1122
01:14:08,998 --> 01:14:10,374
Roddy, darling, listen.

1123
01:14:10,499 --> 01:14:11,500
Roddy.

1124
01:14:14,879 --> 01:14:16,172
Roddy.

1125
01:14:17,506 --> 01:14:19,258
Roddy.

1126
01:14:21,969 --> 01:14:23,763
Roddy, speak to me.

1127
01:14:27,433 --> 01:14:28,893
Roddy, look at me.

1128
01:14:29,018 --> 01:14:30,645
Look at me, Roddy.

1129
01:14:34,941 --> 01:14:39,195
It's alright now,
Bonnie.

1130
01:14:49,830 --> 01:14:52,166
Roddy.

1131
01:14:52,291 --> 01:14:53,584
No, no.

1132
01:14:53,709 --> 01:14:55,211
Roddy, no.

1133
01:14:55,336 --> 01:14:56,379
Roddy!

1134
01:14:58,589 --> 01:14:59,882
Roddy!

1135
01:15:00,007 --> 01:15:02,885
Oh, Roddy,
don't leave me.

1136
01:15:03,010 --> 01:15:05,179
Please don't leave me.

1137
01:15:08,933 --> 01:15:10,351
Come on, you'll have to
clear out of here.

1138
01:15:10,476 --> 01:15:13,854
Come on, get back! Back up!
Come on! Back up.

1139
01:15:16,273 --> 01:15:18,484
- Get the coroner.
- Alright, I will.

1140
01:15:21,988 --> 01:15:23,114
Luva.

1141
01:15:23,239 --> 01:15:24,865
By golly, they got him.

1142
01:15:27,034 --> 01:15:29,036
Who are you?

1143
01:15:29,161 --> 01:15:31,497
Do you know this boy?

1144
01:15:31,622 --> 01:15:32,623
Yes.

1145
01:15:36,794 --> 01:15:38,754
Don't touch that gun.
Don't touch anything.

1146
01:15:38,879 --> 01:15:39,964
Yes, sir.

1147
01:16:07,533 --> 01:16:09,535
Hey, what are you doing?

1148
01:16:09,660 --> 01:16:10,703
You know.

1149
01:16:12,621 --> 01:16:14,832
Area 400.

1150
01:16:17,626 --> 01:16:19,378
Parker talking.
Make it snappy.

1151
01:16:19,503 --> 01:16:22,965
This is
Bonnie Jordan speaking.

1152
01:16:23,090 --> 01:16:25,468
I-I found out who...

1153
01:16:26,969 --> 01:16:28,679
killed Bert Scranton.

1154
01:16:31,599 --> 01:16:34,185
It was Rodney Jordan,
my brother.

1155
01:16:34,310 --> 01:16:36,729
What's that?
Your brother?

1156
01:16:36,854 --> 01:16:38,230
Wait a minute.
Come on, boys.

1157
01:16:38,355 --> 01:16:40,649
We got the Scranton-Luva
murder story.

1158
01:16:40,775 --> 01:16:44,653
Just a minute, Jordan.
Take this down, boys.

1159
01:16:44,779 --> 01:16:47,323
Alright. Give me some more.
Make it snappy now.

1160
01:16:47,448 --> 01:16:52,787
I got a job
in Luva's nightclub as a dancer.

1161
01:16:52,912 --> 01:16:54,830
While I was
in his apartment tonight,

1162
01:16:54,955 --> 01:16:59,293
the phone rang,
and I answered it.

1163
01:16:59,418 --> 01:17:01,253
And...

1164
01:17:01,378 --> 01:17:03,422
And it was my brother.

1165
01:17:05,591 --> 01:17:07,885
Hey!
Special gangland killing!

1166
01:17:08,010 --> 01:17:11,555
High-society boy
gangland killing, extry!

1167
01:17:11,680 --> 01:17:14,975
Hey! Bert Scranton's murderer
found, extry!

1168
01:17:15,101 --> 01:17:16,977
Hey! Extry, extry!

1169
01:17:17,103 --> 01:17:20,231
Hey!
Special gangland killing, extry!

1170
01:17:20,356 --> 01:17:23,025
High-society boy
in gangland...

1171
01:17:25,611 --> 01:17:27,279
Bonnie, I don't see
why you should leave us.

1172
01:17:27,404 --> 01:17:29,240
There's no disgrace
attached to you, you know.

1173
01:17:29,365 --> 01:17:31,951
It isn't that.

1174
01:17:33,410 --> 01:17:35,955
But I just feel like I want
to get away from everything.

1175
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:39,166
I kind of hate to see
you leave that desk of yours.

1176
01:17:39,291 --> 01:17:40,960
You did a mighty fine thing

1177
01:17:41,085 --> 01:17:42,711
in spilling that story
to the paper.

1178
01:17:42,837 --> 01:17:45,172
We know
that you didn't have to do it.

1179
01:17:48,592 --> 01:17:52,596
You know,
I meant every word I said

1180
01:17:52,721 --> 01:17:55,474
in this little yarn
I wrote about you.

1181
01:18:00,563 --> 01:18:03,190
It's the first time
I've banged out a story since

1182
01:18:03,315 --> 01:18:07,862
well, since I used to
leg it around for news myself.

1183
01:18:09,572 --> 01:18:12,324
You've all been
awfully kind to me.

1184
01:18:12,449 --> 01:18:14,660
We've been great friends,
and I...

1185
01:18:30,050 --> 01:18:31,343
Goodbye, Mr. Parker.

1186
01:18:31,468 --> 01:18:34,221
Goodbye.
And good luck.

1187
01:18:35,931 --> 01:18:37,558
Goodbye, Mr. Blair.

1188
01:18:37,683 --> 01:18:40,311
Goodbye, Bonnie.
Let's hear from you.

1189
01:18:40,436 --> 01:18:44,190
You know, we really feel
as if you belong to us.

1190
01:18:44,315 --> 01:18:45,649
Thank you.

1191
01:18:55,242 --> 01:18:58,037
- Goodbye, Bonnie.
- Goodbye.

1192
01:19:05,461 --> 01:19:06,545
Good bye.

1193
01:19:14,011 --> 01:19:15,930
Bonnie.

1194
01:19:16,055 --> 01:19:19,141
I've been here a dozen times
asking for you.

1195
01:19:19,266 --> 01:19:20,726
Can't I talk to you
a minute?

1196
01:19:20,851 --> 01:19:22,144
Let me walk home with you.

1197
01:19:22,269 --> 01:19:23,395
I'm not going home.

1198
01:19:23,520 --> 01:19:25,731
I'm, uh — I'm going away.

1199
01:19:25,856 --> 01:19:27,816
Then I'm going with you.

1200
01:19:27,942 --> 01:19:31,570
I am, Bonnie, no matter
what you have to say about it.

1201
01:19:31,695 --> 01:19:34,156
Won't you let me help you
forget everything?

1202
01:19:34,281 --> 01:19:35,741
That's all I've been doing.

1203
01:19:35,866 --> 01:19:38,369
Trying to forget
the way I've acted toward you.

1204
01:19:38,494 --> 01:19:41,497
I love you, Bonnie.
I've always loved you.

1205
01:19:41,622 --> 01:19:42,873
I know that now.

1206
01:19:42,998 --> 01:19:44,583
I want you to marry me.

1207
01:19:50,422 --> 01:19:51,882
Kiss me, Bob.

1208
01:20:03,560 --> 01:20:05,938
Hey, cut that down
to 50 words, will ya?

1209
01:20:06,063 --> 01:20:08,315
And make it snappy!
