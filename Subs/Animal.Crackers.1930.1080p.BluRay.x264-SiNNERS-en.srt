1
00:02:20,182 --> 00:02:23,601
You must do
your best tonight
Be on your toes, men

2
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,896
There's another
guest tonight
It's one of those men

3
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,066
Who are being feted
by the smart set.

4
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:33,277
We'll see that he gets
what he deserves

5
00:02:33,362 --> 00:02:36,697
Treat him as they do
a king in manner royal

6
00:02:36,782 --> 00:02:40,034
Like a subject to a king
you must be loyal

7
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:43,329
On this object
you must have
your heart set

8
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:46,123
We'll do nothing
to get on his nerves

9
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,460
Again I mention
Be on your toes, men

10
00:02:49,545 --> 00:02:52,588
He craves attention
He's one of those men

11
00:02:52,673 --> 00:02:55,716
Yes, sir,
we will give him
just what he deserves

12
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:09,689
Oh, Hives?
Oh, yes,
Mrs. Rittenhouse?

13
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:12,108
I'd like to make
a few changes in the
assignment of the rooms.

14
00:03:12,192 --> 00:03:13,192
Very good, madam.

15
00:03:13,277 --> 00:03:16,028
Suppose you put
Mr. Chandler in
the blue suite.

16
00:03:16,113 --> 00:03:17,864
And Captain Spaulding,
as guest of honor,

17
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,491
will have
the green duplex
with the two baths.

18
00:03:20,576 --> 00:03:21,659
Two, madam?

19
00:03:21,743 --> 00:03:22,785
Why, yes.

20
00:03:22,870 --> 00:03:26,080
I think the Captain
would like two baths,
don't you?

21
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:30,251
Well, if he's just
returned from Africa,
he may need two baths.

22
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:33,629
Mr. Roscoe W. Chandler.

23
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:37,425
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
well!

24
00:03:38,927 --> 00:03:41,137
Mr. Chandler.

25
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:43,347
So nice
to see you.

26
00:03:43,974 --> 00:03:46,100
The famous Beaugard,
as I have promised.

27
00:03:46,184 --> 00:03:49,145
Mr. Chandler, how
can I ever express
my gratitude?

28
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:51,814
Oh, it's nothing.
Nothing?

29
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:56,527
You return from Europe
with a masterpiece
valued at $100,000,

30
00:03:56,612 --> 00:03:58,863
and instead of
displaying it yourself,

31
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,617
you allow me to unveil it
at my party in honor of
Captain Spaulding.

32
00:04:02,701 --> 00:04:04,368
You call
that nothing?

33
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:06,287
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
I...

34
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:09,540
Uh, will you please
remove that to the place

35
00:04:09,625 --> 00:04:10,750
where it is
to be exhibited?

36
00:04:10,876 --> 00:04:14,003
Very good, sir.
And uh,
very careful, please.

37
00:04:14,463 --> 00:04:17,214
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
you think
that is something?

38
00:04:17,299 --> 00:04:20,676
It is nothing compared
to what I would
like to do for you.

39
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:23,304
You are a very
beautiful woman.

40
00:04:23,388 --> 00:04:25,473
No, no,
Mr. Chandler.

41
00:04:25,557 --> 00:04:27,391
Well, maybe I'm wrong.

42
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:29,101
What?

43
00:04:30,145 --> 00:04:32,021
Please, do not go,
Mrs. Rittenhouse,

44
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,564
I love you.
I know, but...

45
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:35,816
Do not take away your hand.
I tell you, I love you.

46
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:37,860
Careful...
Hello, Mother.

47
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:39,445
Playing house?

48
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,990
Well, uh,
if you'll pardon me.

49
00:04:43,742 --> 00:04:45,242
Have you seen
Johnny Parker?

50
00:04:45,327 --> 00:04:47,411
I wish you'd get
Johnny Parker
out of your mind

51
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:49,789
and show more respect
to Mr. Chandler.

52
00:04:49,873 --> 00:04:53,459
The trouble with you is
you don't take these
social affairs seriously.

53
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:56,587
What would you
suggest, Mom? Suicide?

54
00:04:56,672 --> 00:04:59,924
I would suggest...

55
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:03,302
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
Captain Spaulding
has arrived!

56
00:05:03,387 --> 00:05:06,347
Splendid.
Oh, I'm so glad.

57
00:05:06,431 --> 00:05:09,392
My friends,
Captain Spaulding
has arrived.

58
00:05:09,476 --> 00:05:12,937
At last we are to meet him
The famous Captain Spaulding

59
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:16,357
From climates hot
and scalding
The Captain has arrived

60
00:05:16,441 --> 00:05:19,986
Most heartily we'll greet him
with plain and fancy cheering

61
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:23,489
Until he's hard of hearing
The Captain has arrived

62
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,617
At last the Captain

63
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:32,498
Has arrived

64
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,334
Mr. Horatio W. Jamison,

65
00:05:35,419 --> 00:05:38,045
field secretary
to Captain Spaulding.

66
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:49,348
I represent
the Captain who insists
on my informing you

67
00:05:49,433 --> 00:05:52,351
Of these conditions
under which
he camps here

68
00:05:52,436 --> 00:05:55,980
In one thing he is
very strict he wants
his women young and thin

69
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:59,233
And as for men,
he won't have
any tramps here

70
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:02,153
And as for men,
he won't have
any tramps here

71
00:06:02,237 --> 00:06:05,406
There must be no tramps

72
00:06:05,824 --> 00:06:09,035
The men must all be
very old the women warm,
the champagne cold

73
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:12,079
It's under these conditions
that he camps here

74
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm announcing
Captain Geoffrey Spaulding

75
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:19,879
He's announcing
Captain Geoffrey Spaulding

76
00:06:19,963 --> 00:06:22,965
Oh, dear, he is coming

77
00:06:23,425 --> 00:06:27,428
At last he's here

78
00:06:52,788 --> 00:06:54,038
Well, what
do I owe you?

79
00:06:57,501 --> 00:07:00,503
What? From Africa
to here, $1.85?
That's an outrage.

80
00:07:00,587 --> 00:07:03,047
I told you not to
take me through Australia.
You know it's all ripped up.

81
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:04,340
You should have
come right up
Lincoln Boulevard.

82
00:07:04,424 --> 00:07:05,549
Where do you come
to that stuff?

83
00:07:05,634 --> 00:07:07,510
Turn around the rear end,
I wanna see your
license plates.

84
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:09,345
I don't think,
you're on the square.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.

85
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,722
I'll attend
to you later.
Oh, Captain Spaulding.

86
00:07:11,807 --> 00:07:14,100
Why you're one of
the most beautiful
women I've ever seen.

87
00:07:14,226 --> 00:07:16,727
That's not saying
much for you.
Captain Spaulding,

88
00:07:16,812 --> 00:07:18,979
Rittenhouse Manor
is entirely
at your disposal.

89
00:07:19,064 --> 00:07:23,484
Well, I'm certainly grateful
for this magnificent washout.
Uh, "turnout," and uh,

90
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:25,277
now I'd like
to say a few words.

91
00:07:25,362 --> 00:07:28,280
Hello
I must be going

92
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:31,450
I cannot stay,
I came to say
I must be going

93
00:07:31,535 --> 00:07:35,788
I'm glad I came,
but just the same
I must be going... La la

94
00:07:35,872 --> 00:07:37,832
For my sake
you must stay

95
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:42,545
If you should go away
you'd spoil this party
I am throwing

96
00:07:42,629 --> 00:07:44,547
I'll stay a week or two

97
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,174
I'll stay
the summer through

98
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:50,052
But I am telling you

99
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,098
I must be going.

100
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:57,810
Before you go
will you oblige us

101
00:07:57,894 --> 00:08:01,856
And tell us of
your deeds so glowing

102
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:04,817
I'll do anything you say
In fact, I'll even stay

103
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:05,943
Good

104
00:08:06,027 --> 00:08:11,198
But I must be going

105
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:15,619
There's something
that I'd like to say

106
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:17,746
That he's too modest
to relate

107
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,375
The Captain is a moral man
Sometimes he finds it trying

108
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:23,460
This fact I'll emphasize
with stress

109
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:25,629
I never take a drink unless

110
00:08:25,714 --> 00:08:27,214
Somebody's buying

111
00:08:27,299 --> 00:08:29,800
The Captain
is a very moral man

112
00:08:29,885 --> 00:08:33,679
If he hears anything obscene
he'll naturally repel it

113
00:08:33,763 --> 00:08:35,764
I hate a dirty joke
I do

114
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:40,436
Unless it's told by someone
who knows how to tell it

115
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,606
The Captain
is a very moral man

116
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:46,650
Hooray for Captain Spaulding
the African explorer

117
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:48,110
Did someone
call me Schnorer

118
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:50,237
Hooray, hooray, hooray

119
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:56,243
He went into the jungles
where all the monkeys
throw nuts

120
00:08:56,328 --> 00:08:57,828
If I stay here
I'll go nuts

121
00:08:57,913 --> 00:09:00,122
Hooray, hooray, hooray

122
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,878
He put all his reliance
in courage and defiance

123
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,421
And risked his life
for science

124
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:08,964
Hey, hey

125
00:09:09,758 --> 00:09:12,259
He is the only
white man
who covered every acre

126
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,053
I think I'll try and make her

127
00:09:14,137 --> 00:09:15,971
Hooray, hooray, hooray

128
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:31,612
He put all his reliance
in courage and defiance

129
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:33,322
And risked his life
for science

130
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,366
Hey, hey

131
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:38,285
Hooray for Captain
Spaulding the African explorer

132
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:39,995
He brought his name
undying fame

133
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:46,877
And that is why we say
hooray, hooray, hooray

134
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:51,257
My friends, I'm highly
gratified at this magnificent
display of effusion.

135
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,341
And I want you to know...

136
00:09:52,425 --> 00:09:55,052
Hooray for Captain Spaulding
the African explorer

137
00:09:55,136 --> 00:09:58,305
He brought his name
undying fame
And that is why we say

138
00:09:58,390 --> 00:10:03,477
Hooray, hooray, hooray

139
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:07,273
My friends, I'm highly
gratified at this magnificent
display of effusion.

140
00:10:07,357 --> 00:10:08,440
And I want you to know...

141
00:10:08,525 --> 00:10:11,110
Hooray for Captain Spaulding
the African explorer

142
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,405
He brought his name
undying fame
And that is why we say

143
00:10:14,489 --> 00:10:19,868
Hooray, hooray, hooray

144
00:10:19,953 --> 00:10:23,580
My friends, I'm highly
gratified at this magnificent
display of effusion.

145
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:24,790
I want you to know...

146
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:27,251
Hooray for
Captain Spaulding
the African explorer

147
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:29,878
Well, somebody's
got to do it!
Captain Spaulding?

148
00:10:29,963 --> 00:10:33,590
It is indeed a great
honor to welcome you
to my poor home.

149
00:10:33,675 --> 00:10:35,926
Oh, it isn't so bad.
Needless to say...

150
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,761
Wait a minute,
I think you're right.
It is pretty bad.

151
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:40,681
As a matter of fact,
it's one of the frowsiest
looking joints I've ever seen.

152
00:10:40,807 --> 00:10:42,433
Why, Captain...
Where did you
get your wallpaper?

153
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:44,685
You're letting
this place run down,
and what's the result?

154
00:10:44,769 --> 00:10:46,770
You're not getting
the class of people
that you used to.

155
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,772
Why, you've got people
here that look like you!

156
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:52,151
Now, I'll tell you what to do.
We'll put up a sign outside,
"Place under new management."

157
00:10:52,235 --> 00:10:54,862
We'll set up
a 75-cent meal that will
knock their eyes out.

158
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:57,156
After we knock their
eyes out, we can charge
them anything we want.

159
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:00,200
Now sign here and give me
your check for $1,500.

160
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:01,493
I want to
tell you, madam,

161
00:11:01,578 --> 00:11:02,911
with this
insurance policy,

162
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,748
you've provided
for your little ones
and for your old age...

163
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,583
Which will be here in
a couple of weeks now,

164
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,084
if I'm any judge
of horseflesh.

165
00:11:09,169 --> 00:11:11,378
And now, madam,
"I feel that the time
has come," the walrus...

166
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,964
Captain Spaulding!
Captain Spaulding!

167
00:11:14,049 --> 00:11:17,551
You stand before me as
one of the bravest men
of all times.

168
00:11:17,635 --> 00:11:19,303
All right,
I'll do that.

169
00:11:19,387 --> 00:11:21,221
In the dark forests
of Africa,

170
00:11:21,306 --> 00:11:23,599
there has been no danger
you have not dared.

171
00:11:23,683 --> 00:11:25,517
You mind if
I don't smoke?

172
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:28,687
Fearlessly, you have
blazed new trails,

173
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,733
scornful of
the lion's roar and
the cannibal's tom-tom.

174
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:34,318
Says you!

175
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:38,781
Never once in all
those weary months did
your footsteps falter.

176
00:11:38,907 --> 00:11:41,158
Cowardice is
unknown to you.

177
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:43,786
Fear is not in you!

178
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,246
Oh, pardon me,
a caterpillar...

179
00:11:46,331 --> 00:11:48,957
Put him over here.

180
00:11:49,042 --> 00:11:51,043
Oh, it must have been
the caterpillar
that frightened him.

181
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,336
Oh, dear.
This is unfortunate.

182
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,254
Don't stand there.
Get the whiskey!

183
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:58,300
Get the whiskey.
The whiskey? The whiskey?
Where is the whiskey?

184
00:11:58,385 --> 00:12:00,594
It's in my little black bag
in the right-hand corner.

185
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,603
Signor Emanuel Ravelli.

186
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:21,573
How do you do?
How do you do?

187
00:12:21,658 --> 00:12:23,784
Where's the
dining room?
I'm surprised.

188
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,869
Say, I used to know
a fellow who looked
exactly like you,

189
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,621
by the name of, uh,
Emanuel Ravelli.

190
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:29,581
Are you his brother?
I am Emanuel Ravelli.

191
00:12:29,707 --> 00:12:32,376
You're
Emanuel Ravelli?
I'm Emanuel Ravelli.

192
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:36,213
Well, no wonder you look
like him, but I insist
there is a resemblance.

193
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:39,299
Hey,
he thinks I look alike.

194
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:42,010
Well, If you do,
it's a tough break
for both of you.

195
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:45,264
You are one of
the musicians, but you were
not due until tomorrow.

196
00:12:45,348 --> 00:12:47,683
Couldn't come tomorrow.
That's too quick.

197
00:12:47,767 --> 00:12:49,351
So, you're lucky they
didn't come yesterday.

198
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:52,604
We were busy yesterday,
but we charge just the same.

199
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,398
This is better
than exploring.

200
00:12:54,482 --> 00:12:55,649
What do you fellows
get an hour?

201
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:57,901
Oh, for playing,
we get a $10 an hour.

202
00:12:57,986 --> 00:12:59,903
I see. What do you
get for not playing?

203
00:12:59,988 --> 00:13:01,488
$12 an hour.

204
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,615
Well, clip me off
a piece of that.

205
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:07,786
Now, for rehearsing,
we make special rate,
that's $15 an hour.

206
00:13:07,912 --> 00:13:09,496
That's for rehearsing?
Yes, that's
for rehearsing.

207
00:13:09,539 --> 00:13:12,583
And what do you get
for not rehearsing?
You couldn't afford it.

208
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,753
You see,
If we don't rehearse,
we don't play.

209
00:13:16,838 --> 00:13:20,424
- And If we don't play...
- That runs into money.

210
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,260
How much will you
want to run into
an open manhole?

211
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:24,970
Just the
cover charge.

212
00:13:27,182 --> 00:13:29,975
Drop in sometime.
Sewer.

213
00:13:30,435 --> 00:13:32,269
Oh, we cleaned
that up pretty well.

214
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:34,730
Well, let's see
how we stand.

215
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:36,064
Flat-footed.

216
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:38,025
Yesterday
we didn't come.

217
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,235
You remember,
yesterday we didn't come.
Oh, I remember.

218
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,862
Yeah, that's $300.

219
00:13:41,988 --> 00:13:44,781
Yesterday you didn't come.
That's $300?
That's $300.

220
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,867
That's reasonable.
I can see that,
all right.

221
00:13:46,951 --> 00:13:48,869
Now, today we
did come.
That's, uh...

222
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,871
That's $100 you owe us.

223
00:13:50,955 --> 00:13:53,040
Hey, I bet I'm gonna
lose on the deal.

224
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,919
Tomorrow we leave.
That's worth about...
A million dollars.

225
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,254
Yeah, that's
all right for me,
but I got a partner.

226
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:00,672
What?
Partner?

227
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:02,758
The Professor!

228
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:25,531
The gates swung open
and a Fig Newton entered.

229
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,950
How do you do?

230
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,160
Goodness!

231
00:14:43,758 --> 00:14:46,009
You haven't got
chocolate, have you?

232
00:14:47,095 --> 00:14:49,346
He's got everything.

233
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:52,808
Hives, take
the Professor's
hat and coat.

234
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,851
And send for
the fumigators.

235
00:14:54,936 --> 00:14:56,019
Oh, my goodness!

236
00:14:56,104 --> 00:14:59,273
Bonjour!

237
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:03,235
Hey, don't you see.
There are ladies present.
What do you think this is?

238
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,487
Put that hat down.
Will you?
What you do there?

239
00:15:05,572 --> 00:15:06,697
Get out.

240
00:15:06,781 --> 00:15:08,115
Don't go near those guns!

241
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,518
A little more
to the right.

242
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,520
Ah-ah,
that's better.

243
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:32,324
Now, see that
the drape is well-hung.

244
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,743
The mistress will
inspect it before
the unveiling.

245
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:36,370
Hello, Hives!

246
00:16:36,704 --> 00:16:39,414
Mrs. Whitehead,
this is a surprise.

247
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,541
And how about me?
Miss Grace,

248
00:16:41,626 --> 00:16:43,168
you've grown so
in the last year.

249
00:16:43,294 --> 00:16:46,463
You haven't lost
any weight, yourself.

250
00:16:46,547 --> 00:16:48,465
No. Unfortunately not.

251
00:16:48,549 --> 00:16:49,966
You know, Hives,
it seems strange

252
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:52,469
to find you working here
instead of in our own home.

253
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,221
Well, after you
left for Europe,

254
00:16:54,305 --> 00:16:56,807
Mrs. Rittenhouse
was good enough
to make me an offer.

255
00:16:56,891 --> 00:16:57,974
Lovely!

256
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:00,310
Oh, by the way, Hives,

257
00:17:00,395 --> 00:17:02,312
what's the secret
about the painting?

258
00:17:02,397 --> 00:17:05,482
No secret.
It's Beaugard's
After the Hunt.

259
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,692
The original?

260
00:17:06,776 --> 00:17:08,235
Most original.

261
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,196
Be careful!

262
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,533
Where did she
get hold of that,
do you suppose?

263
00:17:14,659 --> 00:17:17,994
Is it very valuable?
Is it? It must
be worth a fortune.

264
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:22,666
But sis, it looks as if we
yield the social honors of the
season to Mrs. Rittenhouse.

265
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,501
Well, isn't there
something we can do?

266
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,211
We might shoot ourselves.

267
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:28,338
I'd rather shoot
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

268
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,757
Say, I have an idea.

269
00:17:31,175 --> 00:17:33,593
I copied that painting
in art school a year ago.

270
00:17:34,095 --> 00:17:35,470
Well, what of it?

271
00:17:38,808 --> 00:17:41,101
But, I still
don't get it.

272
00:17:41,185 --> 00:17:43,019
I'll go home
and get the copy.

273
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:44,771
We'll substitute it
for the original.

274
00:17:44,856 --> 00:17:47,441
And when she unveils it,
what'll she have?

275
00:17:47,525 --> 00:17:50,694
An imitation,
and I must admit,
a very poor one.

276
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:52,195
Grace,
you're wonderful.

277
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,864
That's what
I've been telling you.

278
00:17:54,782 --> 00:17:56,116
I won't be long.

279
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,951
All right.
See you later.

280
00:18:02,457 --> 00:18:04,249
Oh, Hives?

281
00:18:05,668 --> 00:18:07,961
Do you still feel
there's a strong bond
between us?

282
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:10,547
Why most certainly,
Mrs. Whitehead.

283
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,215
Strong enough for you
to do me a big favor?

284
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:13,759
Why, anything at all.

285
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:14,968
Well,

286
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:18,555
suppose I were to
ask you to take away
the Beaugard?

287
00:18:18,681 --> 00:18:20,932
What? You mean...
Oh, just temporarily,
of course.

288
00:18:21,017 --> 00:18:23,727
And substitute
something of my own.

289
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:26,730
Well, I should consider it
rather an unusual request.

290
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:27,939
It is, Hives.

291
00:18:28,024 --> 00:18:31,109
But somehow I still
think of you as one
of the Whiteheads.

292
00:18:31,611 --> 00:18:34,571
You may count on me.

293
00:18:35,114 --> 00:18:37,240
My soul is yours.

294
00:18:37,325 --> 00:18:39,159
Even though my body

295
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,994
may belong to
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

296
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:42,704
Why, Hives?

297
00:18:44,749 --> 00:18:47,334
Oh, Mrs. Whitehead.
Arabella!

298
00:18:48,002 --> 00:18:49,669
May I present,
Mr. Parker?

299
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:51,838
Oh, of the
Massachusetts Parkers?

300
00:18:51,964 --> 00:18:55,050
Why, no.
Oh, then the
southern Parkers?

301
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,011
Oh, no!
The central Parkers.

302
00:18:58,095 --> 00:19:00,430
You know, the,
uh, benches and trees.

303
00:19:00,515 --> 00:19:02,182
I see!

304
00:19:05,186 --> 00:19:07,771
Oh! I don't like
that woman.

305
00:19:07,855 --> 00:19:09,564
Well, never mind.
You come over here

306
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:11,316
and sit down
and tell me
whom you do like.

307
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,860
Oh! So,
that's your game.

308
00:19:13,945 --> 00:19:15,821
Now, listen,

309
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:17,656
do you
really love me?

310
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:20,116
Why don't you marry me
and find out.

311
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:22,828
Marry you?
Ha! On what?
Hmm.

312
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,996
Last year,
I sold two paintings.

313
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,082
One at $100
and one at $50.

314
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,543
Could we live
on $150 a year?

315
00:19:29,794 --> 00:19:31,753
Oh, we wouldn't
need any money!

316
00:19:32,213 --> 00:19:35,966
I've got a charge account
in every shop on 5th Avenue.

317
00:19:37,093 --> 00:19:39,594
Well, if I
had any brains,

318
00:19:39,679 --> 00:19:42,138
I'd give up painting
and get a regular job.

319
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,101
You know, I had a cousin
who made $50,000 on
Wall Street last year.

320
00:19:46,561 --> 00:19:48,728
Oh, I don't want
to marry your cousin.

321
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:51,690
I'm a darn fool.
I want to marry you.

322
00:19:52,441 --> 00:19:54,025
Say,

323
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:57,612
why don't we get
that old bluff, Chandler,
to buy a portrait from you?

324
00:19:57,697 --> 00:20:00,824
Chandler? Ha!
What does he
know about art?

325
00:20:00,908 --> 00:20:04,327
Well, the less he knows,
the easier it will be
for you to sell him.

326
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,372
They're right upstairs.
You can't miss them.

327
00:20:07,456 --> 00:20:08,999
Go around to
the other side.

328
00:20:11,752 --> 00:20:13,169
Mrs. Rittenhouse?

329
00:20:14,005 --> 00:20:15,797
Yoo-hoo!

330
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:18,842
Oh, Captain Spaulding,
how are you?

331
00:20:20,177 --> 00:20:23,096
Tell me,
are you alone?

332
00:20:23,764 --> 00:20:25,849
Captain,
I don't understand.

333
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,475
What?
You don't understand
being alone?

334
00:20:27,560 --> 00:20:29,603
Don't give me
that innocent stuff
or you'll be alone!

335
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:32,772
A big cluck like you
turning cute on me!

336
00:20:36,402 --> 00:20:38,612
Mrs. Rittenhouse?
Yes?

337
00:20:38,696 --> 00:20:40,655
Oh, pardon me.

338
00:20:41,115 --> 00:20:42,699
You've been
affected like this
yourself, haven't you?

339
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:45,493
Oh,
no, Captain.

340
00:20:45,578 --> 00:20:46,786
Well, you will be.

341
00:20:46,871 --> 00:20:50,081
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
ever since I met you,

342
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,542
I've swept you
off my feet.

343
00:20:52,627 --> 00:20:54,377
Something has been
throbbing within me.

344
00:20:54,462 --> 00:20:58,256
Oh, it's been beating like
the incessant tom-tom
in the primitive jungle.

345
00:20:58,341 --> 00:20:59,925
There's something
that I must ask you.

346
00:21:00,009 --> 00:21:01,635
What is it,
Captain?

347
00:21:02,303 --> 00:21:04,387
Would you wash out
a pair of socks for me?

348
00:21:04,472 --> 00:21:06,473
Captain,
I'm surprised.

349
00:21:06,599 --> 00:21:09,309
Well, that maybe surprise you,
but it's been
on my mind for weeks.

350
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:11,645
It's just my way
of telling you that
I love you. That's all.

351
00:21:11,729 --> 00:21:12,854
I love you. I...
Captain...

352
00:21:12,939 --> 00:21:16,900
Mrs. Whitehead.
I beg your pardon.
I beg your pardon.

353
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,068
Am I intruding?

354
00:21:18,152 --> 00:21:19,527
Are you intruding?

355
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:21,738
Just when I had her
on the five-yard line.

356
00:21:22,573 --> 00:21:24,282
I should say
you are intruding!

357
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:26,284
I should say
you are intruding!
Pardon me,

358
00:21:26,369 --> 00:21:29,245
I was using
the subjunctive instead
of the past tense.

359
00:21:29,330 --> 00:21:32,040
Yes, we're way past tents.
We're living
in bungalows now.

360
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:34,042
This is a mechanical age,
of course.

361
00:21:34,168 --> 00:21:35,251
Mrs. Whitehead,

362
00:21:35,336 --> 00:21:37,420
you haven't met
Captain Spaulding,
have you?

363
00:21:37,505 --> 00:21:40,090
Why, no. I haven't.
How are you?

364
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,216
How are you?

365
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:43,218
I'm fine, thank you.
And how are you?

366
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,053
And how are you?

367
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:47,263
That leaves you
one up.

368
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:50,558
Did anyone ever tell you
you had beautiful eyes?

369
00:21:50,643 --> 00:21:51,726
No.

370
00:21:51,811 --> 00:21:54,729
Well, you have.
And so have you!

371
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:56,856
He shot her a glance.

372
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:00,026
As a smile played
around his lips.

373
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:02,779
Yes. I don't think
I've ever seen

374
00:22:02,863 --> 00:22:04,948
four more beautiful eyes
in my life.

375
00:22:05,032 --> 00:22:06,616
Well, three, anyway.

376
00:22:06,701 --> 00:22:07,993
You know,
you two girls
have everything.

377
00:22:08,077 --> 00:22:11,454
You're tall and short,
and slim and stout,
blonde and brunette,

378
00:22:11,539 --> 00:22:14,040
and that's just
the kind of a girl
I crave!

379
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,209
We three would make
an ideal couple.

380
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:18,294
Why, you've got beauty,
charm, money.

381
00:22:18,379 --> 00:22:19,671
You have that money,
haven't you?

382
00:22:19,755 --> 00:22:22,048
Because, if you haven't,
we can quit right now.

383
00:22:22,133 --> 00:22:24,009
The Captain is charming,
isn't he?

384
00:22:24,093 --> 00:22:25,802
I'm fascinated.

385
00:22:25,886 --> 00:22:28,304
I'm fascinated, too.
Right on the arm.

386
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:31,766
Fascinated.
Whim-wham.

387
00:22:31,934 --> 00:22:35,645
If I were Eugene O'Neill,
I could tell you what
I really think of you two.

388
00:22:35,730 --> 00:22:36,813
You know,
you're very fortunate

389
00:22:36,897 --> 00:22:38,857
the theater guild
isn't putting this on.

390
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,358
And so is the guild.

391
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:45,363
Pardon me while I have
a strange interlude.

392
00:22:47,324 --> 00:22:49,909
Why, you couple of baboons,

393
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,495
what makes you think
I'd marry either one of you?

394
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,998
Strange how the wind
blows tonight.

395
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:58,418
It has a thin, eerie voice.
Reminds me of
poor old Marsden.

396
00:22:58,502 --> 00:23:01,171
How happy I could be
with either of these two

397
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:03,757
if both of them
just went away.

398
00:23:05,092 --> 00:23:06,509
Well, what do
you say, girls?

399
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:08,011
What do you say?
Will you marry me?

400
00:23:08,095 --> 00:23:09,637
But, Captain,
which one of us?

401
00:23:09,722 --> 00:23:13,016
Both of you.
Let's all get married.
This is my party.

402
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,643
Party. Party.

403
00:23:16,604 --> 00:23:18,563
Here I am talking
of parties.

404
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,107
I came down here
for a party.
What happens?

405
00:23:21,192 --> 00:23:23,943
Nothing.
Not even ice cream.

406
00:23:24,945 --> 00:23:27,530
The gods look down
and laugh.

407
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:29,282
This would be
a better world
for children

408
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,451
if the parents had
to eat the spinach.

409
00:23:33,204 --> 00:23:34,871
Well, what do
you say, girls?

410
00:23:34,955 --> 00:23:37,165
What do you say?
Are we all
going to get married?

411
00:23:37,249 --> 00:23:38,958
All of us?
All of us!

412
00:23:39,043 --> 00:23:40,376
But that's bigamy.

413
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:42,212
Yes, and it's
big of me, too!

414
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:44,672
It's big of all of us.
Let's be big for a change.

415
00:23:44,757 --> 00:23:46,841
I'm sick of these
conventional marriages.

416
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:48,968
One woman and one man
was good enough for
your grandmother,

417
00:23:49,053 --> 00:23:50,720
but who wants to marry
your grandmother?

418
00:23:50,805 --> 00:23:53,056
Nobody. Not even
your grandfather.

419
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:55,350
Think of the honeymoon,
strictly private.

420
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:57,352
I wouldn't let
another woman
in on this.

421
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,312
Well, maybe one or two,
but no men.

422
00:23:59,396 --> 00:24:01,147
I may not go, myself.

423
00:24:01,232 --> 00:24:03,900
Are you suggesting
companionate marriage?

424
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:05,151
Well, it's got advantages.

425
00:24:05,236 --> 00:24:06,277
You could live
with your folks,

426
00:24:06,362 --> 00:24:08,321
and I could live
with your folks.

427
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:12,325
And you,
you could sell
Fuller Brushes.

428
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,161
Living with
your folks.

429
00:24:15,621 --> 00:24:18,331
Living with your folks,
the beginning of the end.

430
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:21,751
Drab dead yesterdays
shutting out
beautiful tomorrows.

431
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:26,214
Hideous stumbling footsteps
creaking along the misty
corridors of time.

432
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,758
In those corridors,
I see figures,

433
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:32,470
strange figures,
weird figures.

434
00:24:33,055 --> 00:24:35,890
Steel 186,
anaconda 74,

435
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:38,393
American Can 138.

436
00:24:40,271 --> 00:24:41,604
Well, let's see.
Where were we?

437
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:43,690
Oh, yes! We were
about to get married.

438
00:24:43,774 --> 00:24:46,317
Well, what do you think?
Do you think we really
ought to get married?

439
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:49,404
I think marriage
is a very noble
institution.

440
00:24:52,366 --> 00:24:54,284
It's the foundation
of the American home.

441
00:24:54,368 --> 00:24:56,494
Yes, but the trouble is
you can't enforce it.

442
00:24:56,662 --> 00:24:58,163
It was put over on
the American people...

443
00:24:58,247 --> 00:24:59,914
While our boys
were over there...

444
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,792
...and while our girls
were over here.

445
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:06,254
You know that I've been
waiting at the bottom of
these stairs for years

446
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,006
for just such
a moment as this.

447
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:10,216
Why, Captain,
where are you going?

448
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:11,718
I'm sorry, ladies,
I'm sorry,

449
00:25:11,802 --> 00:25:14,012
But, uh, I'm afraid
we're gonna have to
postpone the wedding

450
00:25:14,096 --> 00:25:16,681
for a few days,
maybe for a few years.

451
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:19,559
Before I get married,
I'm going to sow
a couple of wild oats.

452
00:25:21,979 --> 00:25:24,522
The Captain's
so amusing.
Isn't he charming?

453
00:25:25,608 --> 00:25:27,650
So that's the famous
Beaugard, eh?

454
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:29,360
It's a great picture,
isn't it?

455
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:31,029
Oh, you've
seen it before?

456
00:25:31,155 --> 00:25:35,158
Seen it? I spent three
days in Paris copying it.
You did?

457
00:25:35,242 --> 00:25:37,410
Well, me and a million
other young artists.

458
00:25:37,578 --> 00:25:39,204
Oh.

459
00:25:39,288 --> 00:25:41,497
I bet your copy
was better than
any of them.

460
00:25:41,582 --> 00:25:44,083
Well, it wasn't
bad at that.

461
00:25:44,168 --> 00:25:46,461
I'll show it
to you sometime.

462
00:25:47,379 --> 00:25:49,380
Listen.
What?

463
00:25:49,465 --> 00:25:51,341
Mother's going
to unveil it tonight.

464
00:25:51,425 --> 00:25:52,967
Yeah.

465
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:55,011
Suppose...

466
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:58,556
Suppose when she
unveils it, it's not
the Beaugard at all?

467
00:25:58,641 --> 00:26:00,516
Suppose it's yours!

468
00:26:00,601 --> 00:26:03,436
You mean, put my copy
in place of the Beaugard?
Exactly.

469
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,896
Well, Arabella,
you're crazy.

470
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:06,606
What good
would that do?

471
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,234
What good? Listen.

472
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,693
They'll unveil it.

473
00:26:10,778 --> 00:26:13,029
Chandler will tell
everybody how fine it is.

474
00:26:13,113 --> 00:26:15,365
They'll all cheer
their heads off,

475
00:26:15,449 --> 00:26:17,784
and then we'll tell them
who really painted it.

476
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,410
They'll say,
you're a great artist.

477
00:26:19,495 --> 00:26:21,537
You'll get six commissions
for paintings,

478
00:26:21,622 --> 00:26:25,124
and we can be married
and divorced in no time.

479
00:26:25,209 --> 00:26:26,876
Well, that sounds great.

480
00:26:26,961 --> 00:26:29,754
But what if they
don't like my painting?
What then?

481
00:26:30,464 --> 00:26:32,632
Well, isn't the chance
worth taking?

482
00:26:37,346 --> 00:26:41,307
Ah, I see you're
admiring my picture.
Yes, yes.

483
00:26:41,392 --> 00:26:43,935
Your picture?
Yes, my picture.

484
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,937
Well, it don't look
like you.

485
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:47,063
Hey, wait, wait.

486
00:26:47,147 --> 00:26:50,275
Someplace I met you before,
because you're face
is a very familiar.

487
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:53,695
Well, after all,
I'm one of the most
well-known men in America.

488
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:56,823
The newspapers will keep
on running my photograph.

489
00:26:56,949 --> 00:26:59,826
You're not
Abe Kabbible?
Oh, nonsense!

490
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:06,374
All right. Hey, wait.
If you're not Abe Kabbible,
who are you?

491
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:09,585
Now, please.
Chandler is my name,
Roscoe W. Chandler.

492
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:11,462
Yeah, but I don't care
about the name, you see.

493
00:27:11,547 --> 00:27:14,757
Someplace I met you before,
because your face
is very familiar.

494
00:27:14,842 --> 00:27:16,050
Now, wait.
Let me see,

495
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,261
Were you
ever in Sing Sing?
Please!

496
00:27:18,345 --> 00:27:20,763
No, no, Sing.
I got it. I got it.

497
00:27:20,848 --> 00:27:22,181
Joliet?
Leave me alone!

498
00:27:22,266 --> 00:27:24,517
No? All right,
don't run away.
Don't run away.

499
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:27,812
Leavenworth?
Oh, listen here, I have
never been in these places.

500
00:27:27,896 --> 00:27:30,523
I spend most of
my time in Europe.
Europe.

501
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,150
I got it now.

502
00:27:32,568 --> 00:27:35,278
I know. You come
from Czechoslovakia.

503
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:36,946
You are wrong,
I tell you...

504
00:27:37,031 --> 00:27:39,657
You come from...
Hey, hey, come here,
come here.

505
00:27:39,742 --> 00:27:42,035
I tell you...
Please get away
from me.

506
00:27:42,119 --> 00:27:43,619
Hey, you remember him.
Who was he?

507
00:27:43,704 --> 00:27:45,371
He comes from
Czechoslovakia.

508
00:27:45,456 --> 00:27:48,041
You are wrong, I tell you.
I told you before,
you are mistaken.

509
00:27:48,125 --> 00:27:51,669
He comes
from Czechoslovakia,
and I know who it is.

510
00:27:51,754 --> 00:27:54,130
That's Abie
the fish peddler
from Czechoslovakia.

511
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:55,923
Ridiculous,
I tell you.
You are wrong.

512
00:27:56,008 --> 00:27:58,343
Wait, wait, wait.
We prove it.

513
00:27:58,427 --> 00:27:59,844
He had a birthmark.
Remember?

514
00:27:59,928 --> 00:28:02,472
Oh, please!
What are you...
Leave me alone.

515
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:04,307
On the arm.
On the arm.
On the leg.

516
00:28:04,391 --> 00:28:06,726
On the foot,
up here,
on the mustache.

517
00:28:06,810 --> 00:28:10,146
Ah-ha! There it is.
There is the birthmark.

518
00:28:10,230 --> 00:28:11,814
Abie the fish man.

519
00:28:11,899 --> 00:28:14,359
I confess. I was,
I was Abie the peddler.

520
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,986
Well, how did you
get to be
Roscoe W. Chandler?

521
00:28:17,071 --> 00:28:18,780
Say, how did you get
to be an Italian?

522
00:28:18,864 --> 00:28:20,948
Never mind.
Whose confession
is this?

523
00:28:21,033 --> 00:28:22,158
Well, boys,
for heaven's sake,

524
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:23,743
don't say about
this to anybody,

525
00:28:23,827 --> 00:28:25,495
and I think we can
come to some agreement.

526
00:28:25,579 --> 00:28:28,373
Some arrangement
which would be, uh,
mutually satisfactory.

527
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:32,460
Money, money.
Yeah. Shall we say,
uh, $500?

528
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,380
Piker! $500.
Well, that is all
the cash I have.

529
00:28:35,464 --> 00:28:36,756
$500?

530
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,842
Well, all right.
I tell you what we do.
We'll take your I.O.U.

531
00:28:39,927 --> 00:28:42,678
I've given you my best offer
and that is all you will get.

532
00:28:42,763 --> 00:28:44,389
That's all you give?
Yes.

533
00:28:44,431 --> 00:28:48,101
Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man

534
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:51,396
Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man

535
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,356
Please be quiet,
quiet!

536
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,274
Please.
Now, come here.
Now, listen here.

537
00:28:55,359 --> 00:28:58,486
I have here
a check for $5,000. Now,
I give it to you. Yeah?

538
00:28:58,612 --> 00:29:01,197
Hey. Is it good?
Well, of course
it is good.

539
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,907
Who would give me
a bad check?

540
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,242
I would.

541
00:29:04,326 --> 00:29:06,119
Hey, see if it's good.

542
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:12,875
All right, if you
don't want the check,

543
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,210
then that is all
you will get.

544
00:29:14,294 --> 00:29:15,670
That's all we get?
Yeah.

545
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:19,048
Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man
Please, quiet!

546
00:29:19,133 --> 00:29:22,552
Abie the fish man
Abie the fish man
Quiet!

547
00:29:22,636 --> 00:29:24,595
Abie the fish man

548
00:29:25,389 --> 00:29:27,640
Here! Give me
that handkerchief.

549
00:29:28,142 --> 00:29:30,977
My tie!
Where is my tie?
I...

550
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,855
You're nothing
but a pair of thieves.
That's all.

551
00:29:35,107 --> 00:29:37,733
I get a the tie.
Well, what do you got?

552
00:29:38,068 --> 00:29:40,111
The birthmark!

553
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,491
Hey, hey,
where's your tie?

554
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,909
Well, I...

555
00:29:46,994 --> 00:29:48,161
That's a fine way
for a millionaire

556
00:29:48,245 --> 00:29:49,829
to be running around,
open at the neck.

557
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:52,790
Have you got garters?
Of course,
I have garters. Here.

558
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,668
Oh! They've taken
my garters, too!
A likely story.

559
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,212
Turning collegiate on me, eh?
Have you got socks?

560
00:29:58,297 --> 00:29:59,589
Certainly.
Here they are.

561
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:01,090
Oh, yeah.
You have got socks.

562
00:30:01,175 --> 00:30:03,426
They look pretty old
to me, too.
Whose are they?

563
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:06,179
My old socks.
Let me introduce myself.

564
00:30:06,305 --> 00:30:09,474
My name is Spaulding,
Captain Spaulding.
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.

565
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:11,976
Well, this is a treat,
your treat.

566
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,061
You have heard
about me?

567
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:16,606
Yes, I've heard about you
for a great many years,
Mr. Chandler,

568
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,941
and I'm getting
pretty darn sick
of it, too.

569
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,737
Quite naturally,
I've also heard of the
great Captain Spaulding.

570
00:30:22,821 --> 00:30:24,947
Well, that's fine.
I've heard of you
and you've heard of me.

571
00:30:25,032 --> 00:30:26,949
Now, have you ever heard
the one about
the two Irishmen?

572
00:30:27,034 --> 00:30:29,452
Oh, yes!

573
00:30:30,871 --> 00:30:32,997
Now that I've got
you in hysterics,
let's get to business.

574
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,749
My name is Spaulding,
Captain Spaulding.

575
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,417
I am Roscoe W. Chandler.

576
00:30:36,502 --> 00:30:39,879
And I'm Geoffrey T. Spaulding.
I bet you don't know
what the "T" stands for.

577
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:42,381
Uh, Thomas?
Edgar.

578
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,467
You were close, though.

579
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:46,093
You were close, though,
and you still are, I'll bet.

580
00:30:46,178 --> 00:30:48,346
Now, this is what I want
to talk to you about,
Mr. Chandler.

581
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:50,890
How would you
like to finance
a scientific expedition?

582
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:52,642
Well,
that is a question.

583
00:30:52,726 --> 00:30:54,977
Yes that is a question.
You certainly know a question
when you see it.

584
00:30:55,062 --> 00:30:56,687
I congratulate you,
Mr. Chandler,

585
00:30:56,772 --> 00:30:58,731
and that brings us
right back
to where we were.

586
00:30:58,815 --> 00:31:01,275
How would you
like to finance
a scientific expedition?

587
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:04,278
Well, is there any
particular kind of an
expedition you had in mind?

588
00:31:04,363 --> 00:31:06,322
Well, I tell you.
I'm getting along
in years now.

589
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:08,491
There's one thing
I always wanted to do
before I quit.

590
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:10,201
What is that?
Retire.

591
00:31:10,285 --> 00:31:12,537
Now would you be
interested in a proposition
of that kind?

592
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:14,747
You know, I've always had
an idea that my retirement

593
00:31:14,831 --> 00:31:17,667
would be the greatest
contribution to science
the world has ever known.

594
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,126
This is your chance,
Mr. Chandler.

595
00:31:19,211 --> 00:31:20,920
When I think
what you have done
for this country...

596
00:31:21,004 --> 00:31:22,588
And by the way,
what have you done
for this country?

597
00:31:22,673 --> 00:31:25,341
Oh, well.
I've always tried
to do what I could,

598
00:31:25,425 --> 00:31:27,218
especially in
the world of art.

599
00:31:27,302 --> 00:31:29,262
Art? Well, I don't know
how we drifted
around that.

600
00:31:29,346 --> 00:31:30,888
But what is
your opinion of art?

601
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,015
I am very glad
you asked me!

602
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:34,350
I withdraw the question.

603
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:35,685
This fellow takes
things seriously.

604
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:37,812
It isn't safe
to ask him
a simple question.

605
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:40,523
Tell me Mr. Chandler,
where are you planning on
putting your new opera house?

606
00:31:40,607 --> 00:31:43,317
Oh, I thought
I should put it somewhere
near Central Park.

607
00:31:43,402 --> 00:31:45,236
I see. Why don't you put it
right in Central Park?

608
00:31:45,362 --> 00:31:47,530
Could we do that?
Sure. Do it at night
when no one is looking.

609
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:50,074
Why don't you put it
in the reservoir and get
the whole thing over with?

610
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,285
Of course,
that might interfere
with the water supply.

611
00:31:52,369 --> 00:31:54,370
But after all,
we must remember
that art is art.

612
00:31:54,454 --> 00:31:56,497
Still, on the other hand,
water is water, isn't it?

613
00:31:56,707 --> 00:31:58,416
And east is east,
and west is west.

614
00:31:58,500 --> 00:32:01,002
And If you take cranberries
and stew them
like applesauce,

615
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,462
it tastes more like prunes
than rhubarb does.

616
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:04,922
Now, uh,

617
00:32:05,007 --> 00:32:06,632
now, you tell me
what you know.

618
00:32:06,717 --> 00:32:09,635
Well, I would be
very glad to give you
my opinion.

619
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:11,554
Well, that's dandy.
I'll ask you
for them someday.

620
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,139
Remind me, will you?
I'll tell you what,

621
00:32:13,223 --> 00:32:15,474
could you come
to my office at 10:00
tomorrow morning?

622
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:18,019
If I'm not there,
ask for Mr. Jamison,
that's my secretary,

623
00:32:18,103 --> 00:32:19,687
and If he sees you,
I'll discharge him.

624
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,355
That's a date, now.
Saturday at 3:00.

625
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,441
No, you better
make it Tuesday,
I'm going to Europe Monday.

626
00:32:23,525 --> 00:32:24,984
Pardon me.
My name is Spaulding.

627
00:32:25,152 --> 00:32:26,944
I've always wanted
to meet you,
Mr. Chandler.

628
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:28,529
Tell me.
What do you think
of the traffic problem?

629
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:30,072
What do you think of
the marriage problem?

630
00:32:30,157 --> 00:32:32,908
What do you think of
at night when you
go to bed, you beast?

631
00:32:33,577 --> 00:32:36,370
Well, I'll tell you...
I'd rather not
discuss it any further.

632
00:32:36,455 --> 00:32:38,372
Remember, there
are children present.

633
00:32:38,498 --> 00:32:40,207
Well, you see,
my dear Captain,

634
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:42,918
in the last analysis,
it is a question of money.

635
00:32:43,003 --> 00:32:46,130
The nickel today is
not what it used to be
10 years ago.

636
00:32:46,214 --> 00:32:48,174
I'll go further than that.
I'll get off at the depot.

637
00:32:48,258 --> 00:32:50,343
The nickel is not
what it was 15 years ago.

638
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,636
You know what this
country needs today?

639
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,721
What?
A seven-cent nickel.

640
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:57,433
Yes, sir. We've been
using the five-cent nickel
in this country since 1492.

641
00:32:57,517 --> 00:32:59,685
Now, that's pretty near
100 years, daylight saving.

642
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:01,187
Now, why not give
the seven-cent nickel
a chance?

643
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,230
If that works out,
next year we could have
an eight-cent nickel.

644
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,440
Think what that would mean.

645
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:07,860
You could go to a newsstand
buy a three-cent newspaper
and get the same nickel back.

646
00:33:07,944 --> 00:33:11,113
One nickel,
carefully used, would last
a family a lifetime.

647
00:33:11,198 --> 00:33:13,949
Captain Spaulding,
I think that is
a wonderful idea.

648
00:33:14,034 --> 00:33:15,201
You do, eh?
Yes.

649
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,702
Then there can't
be much to it.

650
00:33:16,787 --> 00:33:18,954
Forget about it.
Well, uh...

651
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,792
Well, tell me,
Captain Chandler, uh,
excuse me, Spaulding.

652
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:24,710
Spaulding, Spaulding,
that's right.
Yeah.

653
00:33:24,795 --> 00:33:26,545
I'm Spaulding,
you're Chandler.

654
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:28,089
Let's have
no more of that
either, eh?

655
00:33:28,173 --> 00:33:30,049
It's bad enough
being Spaulding.

656
00:33:30,133 --> 00:33:31,801
Well, tell me,
Captain Spaulding,

657
00:33:31,927 --> 00:33:34,178
Spaulding is the name?
That's right.
That's right.

658
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:37,181
I'm, I'm Chan...
I'm Spaulding...
Spaulding...

659
00:33:37,265 --> 00:33:38,808
Could I look at
a program a minute?

660
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:42,520
I might be the "News Weekly,"
for all he knows,
or "Coming Next Week."

661
00:33:42,604 --> 00:33:45,189
Well, tell me,
Captain Spaulding,
you've been quite a traveler.

662
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:46,816
Uh, what do you think
about South America?

663
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,192
I'm going there soon,
you know.

664
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,319
Is that so?
Where are you going?
Uruguay.

665
00:33:50,404 --> 00:33:52,405
Well, you go Uruguay
and I'll go mine.

666
00:33:52,489 --> 00:33:55,157
Say, how long has
this been going on?
Let's change the subject.

667
00:33:55,242 --> 00:33:57,493
Take the foreign situation.
Take Abyssinia.

668
00:33:57,577 --> 00:33:58,911
I'll tell you,
you take Abyssinia,

669
00:33:58,995 --> 00:34:01,580
and I'll take a hot
butterscotch sundae
on rye bread.

670
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:03,624
Let's go and see what
the boys in the back room
will have.

671
00:34:03,709 --> 00:34:04,750
But, my...

672
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:14,635
Let's see how
yours compares
with the original.

673
00:34:14,720 --> 00:34:16,387
All right, let's.

674
00:34:18,098 --> 00:34:21,142
Oh! I don't see
any difference.

675
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:23,185
Well, look closer.
Maybe, you'll find
it's better.

676
00:34:23,270 --> 00:34:24,770
Oh, you!

677
00:34:32,779 --> 00:34:33,863
You seen
my partner?

678
00:34:33,947 --> 00:34:35,448
No.

679
00:34:38,702 --> 00:34:40,828
Oh, yoo-hoo.

680
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,542
Oh, Mr. Ravioli.

681
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:50,087
Ravelli, Ravelli.
Oh, Mr. Ravelli.

682
00:34:50,172 --> 00:34:52,173
I want you to do
something for me.

683
00:34:52,257 --> 00:34:55,301
I do anything for you.
What do you want,
I should do?

684
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,011
You see
that painting?

685
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,637
You mean,
this picture?

686
00:34:58,722 --> 00:35:02,975
I want you to take that
out of the frame
and put this one in its place.

687
00:35:03,226 --> 00:35:06,395
You want I should
take this one down
and put this one upstairs.

688
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,105
Yes, that's it.

689
00:35:08,190 --> 00:35:10,065
You want
I should steal!

690
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:13,194
Oh, no, no!
It's not stealing.

691
00:35:13,278 --> 00:35:14,445
Well, then,
I couldn't do it.

692
00:35:14,529 --> 00:35:17,907
Oh, Mr. Ravioli!
Oh, no, no, no.

693
00:35:28,335 --> 00:35:30,628
Hey, get up, get up.
Come here.

694
00:35:30,712 --> 00:35:32,713
That's all you do,
chase the women.

695
00:35:32,923 --> 00:35:34,840
Go. Aw, stop!

696
00:35:35,342 --> 00:35:37,760
Everybody here plays cards.
They don't ask us.

697
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,805
We are a waste all the time.
We been here all day.

698
00:35:42,307 --> 00:35:44,975
How much a we make?
We make a nothing.

699
00:35:45,060 --> 00:35:46,769
First thing you know,
we gonna live on a charity,

700
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:48,938
then go to
the old ladies' home.

701
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:50,523
How do you like that?

702
00:35:50,607 --> 00:35:53,692
No, no.
That's a no good!

703
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:56,487
These people here
all got a money.

704
00:35:56,571 --> 00:35:59,031
Now, we gotta get
someone to play with us,
see.

705
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:00,115
I play anything.

706
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,034
Oh, Signor Ravelli,

707
00:36:02,244 --> 00:36:04,495
I want to speak
to you about the music.
Yeah. How do you do?

708
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:06,789
What's the matter
with you?

709
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:09,834
I thought,
it would be nice...
Go away from me.

710
00:36:09,918 --> 00:36:11,710
What is this?
That's all right.
Just a...

711
00:36:11,795 --> 00:36:13,003
Oh, there you are.
My, dear...

712
00:36:13,088 --> 00:36:14,380
Hello, Professor.

713
00:36:14,464 --> 00:36:16,340
Good heavens.
What's the matter
with his feet?

714
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:20,719
This is embarrassing.

715
00:36:21,513 --> 00:36:23,097
That's nothing.

716
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:25,808
Why, we play
all kinds of games.

717
00:36:25,892 --> 00:36:28,102
We play blackjack,
soccer...

718
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,521
Oh! Dear, I'm so sorry!

719
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:36,235
Mrs. Whitehead...

720
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:38,529
What is the matter
with him?

721
00:36:40,407 --> 00:36:43,534
I wouldn't have
had this happen
for the world.

722
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:45,244
Oh! Heavens!

723
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:47,955
Come on! Atta boy!

724
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:50,332
Go away from me!

725
00:36:50,417 --> 00:36:53,085
One... Two... Three.

726
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,753
Atta boy.
Atta boy.

727
00:36:54,838 --> 00:36:56,297
Good heavens.
Oh, dear.

728
00:36:56,381 --> 00:36:58,507
I must,
get them out. I must get
them out of here!

729
00:36:59,926 --> 00:37:01,760
Oh, look.
You see how terrible
he looks! Look.

730
00:37:01,845 --> 00:37:03,637
I'm so frightened.

731
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,598
Look, what can I do?
I don't know.

732
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:08,183
I better get Hives.
No, let me get her.

733
00:37:08,268 --> 00:37:09,977
Well, you go, then.
I'm just trying
to watch my...

734
00:37:11,521 --> 00:37:13,063
Oh, oh.

735
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:14,607
Oh, this is terrible.

736
00:37:14,691 --> 00:37:17,401
She can't take
it there.

737
00:37:17,485 --> 00:37:19,987
You better get Hives.

738
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:23,449
Go away from me!

739
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,286
This is dreadful.

740
00:37:28,455 --> 00:37:30,915
Well, why don't
you leave him alone?

741
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,834
Stop!

742
00:37:34,294 --> 00:37:37,880
Now that this game is over,
how about playing bridge?

743
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:39,965
You play bridge?
I play bridge a little.

744
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,218
What do you play for?
Oh, we just play
for small stakes.

745
00:37:43,303 --> 00:37:45,429
And French fried
potatoes?

746
00:37:46,473 --> 00:37:49,475
Set it up over there,
Hives.
Very good, madam.

747
00:37:54,439 --> 00:37:56,273
What in the world
is he up to?

748
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,566
Look at this.

749
00:37:57,734 --> 00:37:59,944
The whole house will be
torn to pieces.
Absolutely.

750
00:38:00,028 --> 00:38:02,071
If it isn't one thing,
it's another.

751
00:38:02,155 --> 00:38:04,031
Oh, Hives!
Oh!

752
00:38:06,284 --> 00:38:07,660
Take it away,
Hives.

753
00:38:07,744 --> 00:38:09,328
Extraordinary.
We'll play over here.

754
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:11,789
Now, how do
you want to play?
Honest?

755
00:38:11,873 --> 00:38:13,916
Well, I hope so.

756
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:16,001
You put that
right away.

757
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,796
It's your
own fault.

758
00:38:20,840 --> 00:38:22,424
Come along now.
We'll cut for partners.

759
00:38:22,509 --> 00:38:25,219
Oh, he's my partner.
That's the only way
we play.

760
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:28,597
I'm sorry but it's against
the rules of the games.
We have to cut for partners.

761
00:38:28,682 --> 00:38:30,724
All right.
We cut for partners.

762
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:35,437
I got ace of spades.
He's got ace of spades.

763
00:38:36,022 --> 00:38:37,773
That's what you call
"quin-cidences."

764
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:40,943
Two aces of spaces?
Yeah, he's got
thousands of them.

765
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,612
Well, I suppose
that gives him
the choice of seats.

766
00:38:43,697 --> 00:38:45,990
You have
the choice of seats.

767
00:38:46,408 --> 00:38:49,326
Good heavens!
Not on her lap.
Come on! Sit down.

768
00:38:49,452 --> 00:38:51,328
What's the matter
with him?
I don't know.

769
00:38:51,413 --> 00:38:53,580
He thought it was
contact bridge.

770
00:38:53,665 --> 00:38:55,833
Just a minute now.
Shuffle the cards.

771
00:38:55,917 --> 00:38:58,002
Yeah. You got to
scrumble them up a bit.
You know.

772
00:39:12,225 --> 00:39:14,518
Just a moment.
I'd like to
cut those cards.

773
00:39:37,167 --> 00:39:39,960
That's a better.

774
00:40:00,523 --> 00:40:02,941
Uh, your bid,
partner.

775
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,944
You pass?

776
00:40:06,446 --> 00:40:07,780
Misdeal.

777
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:11,867
You pass?
I bid one spade.

778
00:40:12,077 --> 00:40:14,203
I pass.
Three spades.

779
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,122
Four spades.

780
00:40:18,666 --> 00:40:20,125
One club.

781
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:23,295
I don't understand
this kind of bidding!

782
00:40:23,630 --> 00:40:25,756
Well, you don't
have to understand.

783
00:40:27,842 --> 00:40:30,469
You bid four spades,
huh?

784
00:40:31,387 --> 00:40:33,388
Why, I haven't
a spade in my hand!

785
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,015
All right.
We double.

786
00:40:35,558 --> 00:40:36,892
There's something
wrong here.

787
00:40:36,976 --> 00:40:39,019
I want you to
go over the bidding.

788
00:40:39,187 --> 00:40:42,564
Hey, she wants to
start them up again,
the bidding.

789
00:40:42,732 --> 00:40:43,774
He bids one.

790
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:45,359
One?
One what?

791
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:47,569
That's all right.
You find out.

792
00:40:48,029 --> 00:40:49,530
But we have to know
what he's bidding.

793
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:52,157
We tell you later.
Now I bid two.

794
00:40:52,617 --> 00:40:55,077
Two what?
Uh, two of the same
he bids.

795
00:40:55,161 --> 00:40:56,286
Now, the bidding's over.

796
00:40:56,371 --> 00:40:57,913
See, that's
enough bidding.

797
00:40:57,997 --> 00:40:59,832
Uh, it's your lead.

798
00:40:59,916 --> 00:41:02,084
Oh, no, you
can't lead that.

799
00:41:02,168 --> 00:41:04,795
Why not?
Why, we can't take it.

800
00:41:04,963 --> 00:41:06,672
Well, what should
I lead?

801
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:08,173
Ace.

802
00:41:08,258 --> 00:41:10,634
Ace of spades.
That's very good.

803
00:41:11,511 --> 00:41:15,013
Three of spades,
four of spades...

804
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,351
You trump it?

805
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:22,229
Uh, that's what you
call a finesse.

806
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:23,814
Oh!

807
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:26,775
No spades, partner.
No spades!

808
00:41:35,535 --> 00:41:37,286
Ace of hearts.

809
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,210
Ace of clubs.

810
00:41:48,381 --> 00:41:51,216
Dummy leads.
The dummy leads.

811
00:41:51,968 --> 00:41:53,594
I'm not
the dummy!

812
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:55,554
Well, you could be.

813
00:41:57,932 --> 00:41:59,808
Ace of diamonds.

814
00:42:01,394 --> 00:42:03,395
100 aces, huh?

815
00:42:03,521 --> 00:42:04,813
200?

816
00:42:04,898 --> 00:42:06,398
That's better.

817
00:42:07,108 --> 00:42:08,609
Ace of hearts.

818
00:42:08,693 --> 00:42:11,153
Atta boy,
make a big slam.

819
00:42:11,446 --> 00:42:13,405
Make a big,
big slam!

820
00:42:14,282 --> 00:42:16,033
Ace of spades.

821
00:42:20,705 --> 00:42:22,331
Ace of spades.

822
00:42:22,415 --> 00:42:25,083
That's a good.
He plays a good game.

823
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:29,087
Ace of spades.
He plays a fine game,
all right.

824
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:33,467
Ace of...
I refuse to
play any longer.

825
00:42:33,593 --> 00:42:36,303
You're nothing but
a couple of card sharps.
Good heavens!

826
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,180
What's the matter,
dear?
My shoes are gone!

827
00:42:38,264 --> 00:42:40,599
Good gracious.
He has your slippers.
Come along, come along.

828
00:42:43,353 --> 00:42:45,771
Hey, you take a
the lady's shoes, huh?

829
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,507
Hey. Quiet.

830
00:43:13,633 --> 00:43:15,467
Quiet, quiet.

831
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,142
Hide! Hide!
Somebody's coming.

832
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:30,023
All right.
I make a mistake.
Get up, get up. Come on.

833
00:43:30,316 --> 00:43:32,317
Hurry up.

834
00:43:32,652 --> 00:43:34,695
Come. Hey, hurry up.
Come here.

835
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:36,738
You know what
we gotta do, eh?

836
00:43:36,823 --> 00:43:39,408
We gotta take a that
picture out and put this
one upstairs for the lady.

837
00:43:39,492 --> 00:43:42,119
Wait! No touch.
You got everything ready, huh?

838
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,080
The shovel, the ax,
the dynamite,
the pineapples?

839
00:43:45,206 --> 00:43:47,249
Where's the flash?

840
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,918
That's a no flash.

841
00:43:50,003 --> 00:43:52,754
A flash.
There's a flash. Flash.

842
00:43:53,423 --> 00:43:55,424
That's a flash.
A flash.

843
00:43:55,550 --> 00:43:57,509
Yeah,
that's a flash.

844
00:43:57,719 --> 00:44:00,429
That's a fish!
I no want a fish.
No fish.

845
00:44:00,513 --> 00:44:04,016
Flash. Aw, stop it.
You act crazy.

846
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,852
When you go out
in the night time,
you gotta have a the flash.

847
00:44:09,188 --> 00:44:11,440
Ha! That's a no flash.
That's a flask.

848
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:15,777
Flash. When you wanna
see somebody, you gotta
have a the flash.

849
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:18,405
That's a flush.
What I gonna do
with a flush?

850
00:44:18,865 --> 00:44:21,283
A flash. No flit.

851
00:44:21,367 --> 00:44:24,119
It's a flits.
What am I gonna
do with a flits?

852
00:44:24,329 --> 00:44:26,538
What do you got?

853
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:28,540
That's whatcha
call a flutes.

854
00:44:28,624 --> 00:44:31,793
All you got is a fish,
a flutes, a flits, flutes,
flits and a flutes.

855
00:44:33,338 --> 00:44:35,672
Stop this!
Where's the flash?

856
00:44:37,383 --> 00:44:39,468
Look, when everything
is a light...

857
00:44:39,552 --> 00:44:42,554
And you wanna
make them a dark,
what do you do?

858
00:44:42,972 --> 00:44:46,224
Ah! You're crazy.
I don't want no blackjack.

859
00:44:46,726 --> 00:44:47,976
That's a my mistake,
I guess.

860
00:44:48,061 --> 00:44:51,521
When everything is dark,
and you wanna
make them light...

861
00:44:52,231 --> 00:44:54,358
Yeah, that's a flash.
That's a flash.

862
00:45:01,574 --> 00:45:03,325
Hey,
that's a good,
all right.

863
00:45:03,409 --> 00:45:06,411
The storm put the lights out.
Now, nobody can see
what we do.

864
00:45:06,496 --> 00:45:08,997
That's a fine.
Where is the flash?

865
00:45:10,291 --> 00:45:12,292
Where's the flash?

866
00:45:12,794 --> 00:45:15,212
I no want the fish!
The flash!

867
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:18,006
No, no flute! No, flute!

868
00:45:18,091 --> 00:45:19,841
What's the matter
with you, eh?

869
00:45:19,926 --> 00:45:22,928
Flash. Before
the people come,
get a the flash.

870
00:45:23,262 --> 00:45:24,930
What's the matter?
You lose it?

871
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:27,766
Well, you gotta find it.
Look for it.

872
00:45:29,394 --> 00:45:32,062
All right, all right.
Never mind. Come on.
We'll work without it.

873
00:45:40,988 --> 00:45:43,865
Yes, madam.
Hide! Hide!
Somebody's coming.

874
00:45:44,283 --> 00:45:46,660
Hide, hide, hide.

875
00:45:46,744 --> 00:45:48,954
Quiet! Shut up!
Quiet.

876
00:45:49,247 --> 00:45:53,125
Shut up. Be quiet.
I know where you are.
It's all right.

877
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:56,920
Oh, Captain Spaulding?

878
00:45:57,004 --> 00:45:58,839
Captain Spaulding,
where are you?

879
00:45:58,923 --> 00:46:01,967
Here. Yes,
what's the trouble?

880
00:46:02,051 --> 00:46:03,718
The storm has
put the lights out,

881
00:46:03,803 --> 00:46:06,471
and you can't see
your hand before
your face.

882
00:46:07,014 --> 00:46:09,224
You wouldn't
get much enjoyment
out of that.

883
00:46:09,600 --> 00:46:12,018
I don't know what
you're gonna do,
but I'm gonna take a nap.

884
00:46:12,103 --> 00:46:13,687
Leave me a call
for 3:00.

885
00:46:16,482 --> 00:46:17,732
Make it 3:30.

886
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,278
You certainly get
service around here.

887
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:23,822
Pardon me,
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
did you lose a fish?

888
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,408
What?
Well, somebody lost it.

889
00:46:26,492 --> 00:46:28,743
Will you take it out
in the kitchen
and have it fried for me?

890
00:46:28,828 --> 00:46:31,288
Did you hear that?

891
00:46:31,747 --> 00:46:33,623
There's somebody
over there.

892
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,209
I say, there's
somebody over there!

893
00:46:36,294 --> 00:46:39,671
Don't be silly.
The house is just settling.
That's all.

894
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:42,966
Anybody over there?
I don't
see anybody.

895
00:46:43,092 --> 00:46:45,218
There you are.
If there's anybody there,
we'd see him, wouldn't I?

896
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:52,559
- Oh, what is it?
- Captain, what is it?

897
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:55,520
You know,
what I think?
I think you got roaches.

898
00:47:04,906 --> 00:47:06,781
Yes, you got roaches,
all right.

899
00:47:06,866 --> 00:47:08,867
And the biggest one
has got asthma.

900
00:47:09,577 --> 00:47:11,828
Oh, this is terrible.
Captain,
let's get out of here.

901
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:20,253
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.

902
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:23,298
Hey! Somebody
put on the lights.

903
00:47:23,382 --> 00:47:26,009
All right.
We get a the picture.
We don't make one sound.

904
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,345
Come on. Let's go.
Get out of here.

905
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:31,640
What do you want?

906
00:47:31,724 --> 00:47:33,308
Oh, the fish.
Come on, come on.

907
00:47:36,187 --> 00:47:38,980
Oh! That's some storm,
huh?

908
00:47:39,065 --> 00:47:40,941
That's a regular tomato.

909
00:47:41,025 --> 00:47:43,527
Come on.
Let's go this way.
I think it's a shortcut.

910
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:45,362
Come on, let's go.

911
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:49,074
California!

912
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,960
Oh, Captain, how thrilling.
And then what happened?

913
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,420
It was nothing at all.
I'd rather not discuss it.

914
00:48:02,505 --> 00:48:05,090
But I can't wait to
hear the finish.
I must hear it.

915
00:48:05,174 --> 00:48:07,509
Well, there I was.
There I was in the
top of the tree

916
00:48:07,593 --> 00:48:09,803
with this rhinoceros
pointing his gun
straight at me.

917
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:11,513
A rhinoceros?
Yes.

918
00:48:11,806 --> 00:48:13,431
Captain, what did you do?

919
00:48:13,516 --> 00:48:16,017
What could I do?
I had to marry his daughter.

920
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,604
What kind of a story
do you call that?
All right, you tell one.

921
00:48:20,648 --> 00:48:22,023
And now, my friends,

922
00:48:22,108 --> 00:48:24,192
before we start
the musical program,

923
00:48:24,277 --> 00:48:28,113
Captain Spaulding has
kindly consented to tell us
about his trip to Africa.

924
00:48:28,197 --> 00:48:30,115
Captain Spaulding.
Me?

925
00:48:33,452 --> 00:48:36,663
My friends,
I'm going to tell you
of that great mysterious,

926
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,748
wonderful continent
known as Africa.

927
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:42,043
Africa is God's country,
and he can have it.

928
00:48:42,628 --> 00:48:43,670
Well, sir.

929
00:48:43,796 --> 00:48:46,798
We left New York
drunk and early on
the morning of February 2.

930
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,468
After 15 days on the water
and six on the boat,

931
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:52,721
we finally arrived
on the shores of Africa.

932
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:57,726
We once proceeded 300 miles
into the heart of the jungle,
where I shot a polar bear.

933
00:48:57,810 --> 00:49:00,520
This bear was 6' 7"
in his stocking feet
and had shoes on...

934
00:49:00,605 --> 00:49:03,356
Pardon me,
just a moment, Captain.
Just a moment.

935
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:06,610
I always thought
that polar bears lived
in the frozen north.

936
00:49:06,694 --> 00:49:08,236
Oh, you did. Well,
this bear was anemic,

937
00:49:08,321 --> 00:49:10,405
and he couldn't stand
the cold climate.

938
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:13,074
He was a rich bear
and could afford to
go away in the winter.

939
00:49:13,659 --> 00:49:16,328
You take care of your animals
and I'll take care of mine!

940
00:49:16,829 --> 00:49:19,164
Frozen north, my eye.

941
00:49:20,333 --> 00:49:23,043
From the day of our arrival,
we led an active life.

942
00:49:23,127 --> 00:49:26,921
The first morning saw us
up at 6:00, breakfasted
and back in bed at 7:00.

943
00:49:27,006 --> 00:49:29,007
This was our routine
for the first three months.

944
00:49:29,508 --> 00:49:31,801
We finally got so
we were back in bed at 6:30.

945
00:49:32,428 --> 00:49:35,388
One morning, I was sitting
in front of the cabin,
smoking some meat.

946
00:49:35,514 --> 00:49:37,015
Smoking some meat?

947
00:49:37,141 --> 00:49:38,850
Yes, there wasn't
a cigar store
in the neighborhood.

948
00:49:39,268 --> 00:49:41,269
As I say,
I was sitting
in front of the cabin

949
00:49:41,354 --> 00:49:42,646
when I bagged
six tigers.

950
00:49:42,772 --> 00:49:43,855
Oh, Captain!
Six of them
biggest I...

951
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:46,358
Captain, did you
catch six tigers?

952
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:48,401
I bagged them.
I... I bagged them
to go away,

953
00:49:48,486 --> 00:49:50,445
but they hung around
all afternoon.

954
00:49:50,529 --> 00:49:53,782
They were the most
persistent tigers
I've ever seen.

955
00:49:53,866 --> 00:49:56,076
The principal animals
inhabiting
the African jungle

956
00:49:56,160 --> 00:49:58,828
are moose, elks
and Knights of Pythias.

957
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:00,455
Of course,
you all know
what a moose is.

958
00:50:00,539 --> 00:50:01,790
That's big game.

959
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:03,375
The first day
I shot two bucks.

960
00:50:03,459 --> 00:50:05,293
That was
the biggest game we had.

961
00:50:05,378 --> 00:50:07,504
As I say,
you all know
what a moose is.

962
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:11,549
A moose runs around
on the floor and eats cheese
and is chased by the cats.

963
00:50:11,634 --> 00:50:13,885
The elks, on the other hand,
live up in the hills.

964
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:17,055
And in the spring,
they come down
for their annual convention.

965
00:50:17,139 --> 00:50:19,641
It is interesting
to watch them come
to the water hole.

966
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:20,684
And you should
see them run

967
00:50:20,768 --> 00:50:23,019
when they find
it's only a water hole!

968
00:50:23,104 --> 00:50:25,980
What they're looking
for is an elk-a-hole.

969
00:50:26,065 --> 00:50:28,817
One morning
I shot an elephant
in my pajamas.

970
00:50:28,901 --> 00:50:31,152
How he got
in my pajamas,
I don't know.

971
00:50:31,237 --> 00:50:33,238
Then we tried
to remove the tusks.

972
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:35,532
The tusks.
That's not so easy
to say. Tusks.

973
00:50:35,616 --> 00:50:36,783
You try that sometime.

974
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:38,993
Tusks.
Oh, simple. Tusks.

975
00:50:39,078 --> 00:50:40,161
Pardon me,
my name
is Spaulding.

976
00:50:40,246 --> 00:50:42,497
I've always wanted
to meet you,
Mr. Chandler.

977
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:44,708
As I say, we tried
to remove the tusks.

978
00:50:44,792 --> 00:50:47,669
But they were
embedded in so firmly
that we couldn't bust them.

979
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:50,004
Of course,
in Alabama,
the Tuscaloosa.

980
00:50:50,089 --> 00:50:54,008
But, uh, that's entirely
irr-elephant to what
I was talking about.

981
00:50:54,135 --> 00:50:55,760
We took some pictures
of the native girls,

982
00:50:55,845 --> 00:50:57,178
but they weren't developed.

983
00:50:57,263 --> 00:50:59,013
But we're going
back again
in a couple of weeks.

984
00:50:59,098 --> 00:51:00,890
I will...
A very enlightening
speech, Captain.

985
00:51:01,016 --> 00:51:03,435
Very enlightening.
Hooray for
Captain Spaulding!

986
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:05,937
Three cheers
for Captain Spaulding!

987
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:09,232
Aw. Oh, really I...
Three cheers for
Captain Spaulding!

988
00:51:09,358 --> 00:51:11,818
Three cheers...
No one asked
for the chairs!

989
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:12,902
Put them right
where you found them.

990
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,195
Now, go now.
Go now.
Go on, go on!

991
00:51:14,280 --> 00:51:16,573
Go on with
your chairs.
Get out!

992
00:51:18,117 --> 00:51:20,076
Go on, go on,
go on, you.

993
00:51:20,286 --> 00:51:21,578
And, now, friends,

994
00:51:21,662 --> 00:51:24,706
Signor Ravelli
will oblige us
at the piano.

995
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:26,541
Signor Ravelli.

996
00:51:29,336 --> 00:51:31,296
Signor Ravelli's
first selection
will be

997
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:34,632
Somewhere My Love
Lies Sleeping
With a Male Chorus.

998
00:52:04,371 --> 00:52:06,039
One, two, three, four.

999
00:52:07,792 --> 00:52:09,667
One, two,
three, four.

1000
00:52:11,253 --> 00:52:14,923
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

1001
00:52:15,007 --> 00:52:18,218
nine, 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15, 16,

1002
00:52:18,302 --> 00:52:19,427
17, 18, 19, 20...

1003
00:52:36,195 --> 00:52:38,696
Say, if you get
near a song, play it.

1004
00:52:46,831 --> 00:52:48,957
I can't think
of the finish.

1005
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,462
That's strange.
And I can't think
of anything else.

1006
00:52:55,798 --> 00:52:58,466
You know what I think?
I think I went past it.

1007
00:52:59,093 --> 00:53:01,886
I mean, if you
come around again,
jump off.

1008
00:53:02,888 --> 00:53:05,348
I once kept this up
for three days.

1009
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,602
You wouldn't
consider hush money,
would you?

1010
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,898
I can't get him now,
I've got to wait
for inspiration.

1011
00:53:13,983 --> 00:53:15,567
It's about time.

1012
00:53:16,569 --> 00:53:18,027
Play the song
about Montreal.

1013
00:53:18,112 --> 00:53:19,237
Montreal?

1014
00:53:19,321 --> 00:53:21,239
I'm a Dreamer,
Montreal.

1015
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:24,367
I don't know that.
I'll tell you what I do.

1016
00:53:24,451 --> 00:53:26,202
I play one of my own
compositions

1017
00:53:26,287 --> 00:53:27,996
by Victor Herbert.
Make it short.

1018
00:55:36,667 --> 00:55:38,543
He plays
them both well.

1019
00:55:47,428 --> 00:55:49,053
Atta boy.

1020
00:55:51,473 --> 00:55:53,099
The old red team
scored that time.

1021
00:55:55,728 --> 00:55:57,395
So did the old
blue one.

1022
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,397
Why do you push, huh?
Why do you push?
Oh, please, stop them.

1023
00:55:59,481 --> 00:56:01,607
Let them alone.
They may exterminate
each other.

1024
00:56:01,734 --> 00:56:03,901
Come on, come on!
The best thing that can
happen for either of them.

1025
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:06,821
And once
for old Purdue.

1026
00:56:20,711 --> 00:56:22,086
I was
afraid of that.

1027
00:56:23,088 --> 00:56:24,547
Hey, I thought
I had the finish.

1028
00:56:24,631 --> 00:56:25,631
I wish you did.

1029
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:26,758
Yours.

1030
00:56:26,842 --> 00:56:28,760
Play the song about
the Irish chiropodist.

1031
00:56:28,844 --> 00:56:30,011
Irish chiropodist?

1032
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,055
My Fate is
in Your Hands.

1033
00:57:07,800 --> 00:57:09,217
Is there a horse
in the house?

1034
00:57:09,301 --> 00:57:10,885
They've got
everything else here.

1035
00:57:10,969 --> 00:57:13,596
And, uh, now,
Mrs. Rittenrotten...

1036
00:57:13,680 --> 00:57:14,680
Uh, Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1037
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:15,723
Yes, a slight error.

1038
00:57:15,808 --> 00:57:17,642
I have a little
surprise for you!

1039
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:18,935
The man is here
for the piano.

1040
00:57:19,019 --> 00:57:20,061
Oh, Captain.

1041
00:57:20,145 --> 00:57:21,771
No, really.
What I meant to say
was that, uh...

1042
00:57:21,855 --> 00:57:25,441
When I departed from
the natives in Africa,
I was presented with a gift.

1043
00:57:25,526 --> 00:57:27,401
And this gift
I'm going
to give to you

1044
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:28,528
at a very low figure.

1045
00:57:28,612 --> 00:57:30,404
Oh, how wonderful,
Captain!

1046
00:57:30,489 --> 00:57:32,949
Well, no.
Don't be too hasty.
Oh, I just...

1047
00:57:33,033 --> 00:57:34,867
This is all
hand-painted.

1048
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:37,912
The whole thing
was done with
the white of an egg.

1049
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:40,748
Well, what is it,
Captain? What is it?

1050
00:57:40,833 --> 00:57:41,916
"What is it?"
you ask.

1051
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,751
This is a hope chest
for a guinea pig.

1052
00:57:43,836 --> 00:57:45,002
Oh.
What is it?

1053
00:57:45,087 --> 00:57:46,462
This magnificent chest...

1054
00:57:46,547 --> 00:57:49,423
No, this...
No, this magnificent chest,

1055
00:57:49,508 --> 00:57:52,552
I now take great pleasure
in presenting to you
with my compliments.

1056
00:57:52,636 --> 00:57:55,138
Captain,
this leaves me
speechless.

1057
00:57:55,222 --> 00:57:57,140
Well, see that you
remain that way.

1058
00:57:57,224 --> 00:57:58,641
And, now,
ladies and
gentlemen...

1059
00:57:58,725 --> 00:58:00,601
Come outside
and say that.

1060
00:58:00,686 --> 00:58:03,020
If we will all adjourn
to the library,

1061
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:06,941
Mrs. Rittenhouse has
another, and perhaps
greater, surprise for us.

1062
00:58:07,025 --> 00:58:08,860
Hmm.
This way, Captain.

1063
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:16,617
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
how do you pay Hives?

1064
00:58:16,702 --> 00:58:18,744
By the week
or by the pound?

1065
00:58:35,846 --> 00:58:37,889
And now,
it is my privilege

1066
00:58:37,973 --> 00:58:39,891
to reveal
the masterpiece

1067
00:58:39,975 --> 00:58:44,478
of Francois Jacques Dubois
Gilbert Beaugard.

1068
00:58:44,563 --> 00:58:45,855
No trains will be sold

1069
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,024
after the magazines
leave the depot.

1070
00:58:49,026 --> 00:58:50,568
After the Hunt.

1071
00:58:55,782 --> 00:58:58,826
There! I told you
you were a great artist.

1072
00:58:59,828 --> 00:59:01,662
Shall we spill
the beans now?

1073
00:59:01,747 --> 00:59:03,414
Let's wait a minute.
Something might happen.

1074
00:59:03,707 --> 00:59:07,585
Now, I'm sure, we'd all
appreciate a few words
from Mr. Chandler,

1075
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:11,589
who will tell us
of the life and work
of the artist, Beaugard.

1076
00:59:11,882 --> 00:59:13,549
And keep it clean.

1077
00:59:14,176 --> 00:59:15,718
Mr. Chandler.

1078
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:22,683
My friends,

1079
00:59:22,768 --> 00:59:26,020
I am quite sure
that you are all
familiar with Beaugard,

1080
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,606
and this is perhaps
his masterpiece.

1081
00:59:29,107 --> 00:59:31,359
In it, he has achieved
the greatness

1082
00:59:31,443 --> 00:59:33,694
in the handling
of color and line.

1083
00:59:33,779 --> 00:59:36,155
Now, you will
see here that I...

1084
00:59:36,240 --> 00:59:38,866
Wait! This is
not my picture.

1085
00:59:38,951 --> 00:59:40,284
This is a rank
imitation!

1086
00:59:40,369 --> 00:59:42,245
What do you mean,
Mr. Chandler?

1087
00:59:42,329 --> 00:59:43,537
Well, here,
see for yourself!

1088
00:59:47,125 --> 00:59:49,252
You are right.
It is not
the Beaugard.

1089
00:59:49,336 --> 00:59:51,087
It certainly isn't.
There's a dog missing!

1090
00:59:51,213 --> 00:59:53,839
Oh, Captain Spaulding,
what shall I do?

1091
00:59:53,924 --> 00:59:55,549
Telephone
the dog catchers
immediately!

1092
00:59:55,634 --> 00:59:57,760
They have taken
the original
and left me this.

1093
00:59:57,844 --> 01:00:00,179
Leave it to me.
I'll throw some light
on this subject.

1094
01:00:01,890 --> 01:00:02,890
Has anyone a match?

1095
01:00:02,975 --> 01:00:05,184
What's wrong?

1096
01:00:05,852 --> 01:00:08,896
- Hives, Hives, where are you?
- Turn on the lights.

1097
01:00:08,981 --> 01:00:11,065
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
did you lose that fish again?

1098
01:00:11,149 --> 01:00:13,192
Oh, Captain,
I'm so worried.

1099
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:15,611
Good heavens!
That one
is gone, too!

1100
01:00:15,862 --> 01:00:17,655
Oh, this is awful.

1101
01:00:17,739 --> 01:00:19,490
The crooks!
The crooks!
They are escaping.

1102
01:00:19,574 --> 01:00:20,700
Follow me, men!

1103
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:22,118
Never mind the men,
just the women.

1104
01:00:22,202 --> 01:00:23,619
Oh, Captain.
Captain!

1105
01:00:23,704 --> 01:00:24,912
- Captain!
- Come on.

1106
01:00:24,997 --> 01:00:25,997
Right this way.

1107
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:28,124
He went out here
someplace.

1108
01:00:33,255 --> 01:00:34,422
Excitement.

1109
01:00:34,506 --> 01:00:37,133
I never saw
anything so funny
in all my life.

1110
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:40,052
It was great,
and there goes
her old party.

1111
01:00:40,137 --> 01:00:42,638
Good old Hives.
Wasn't it funny?

1112
01:00:42,889 --> 01:00:44,640
Oh, very.

1113
01:00:44,725 --> 01:00:46,058
Why, you're
not afraid,
are you, Hives?

1114
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:48,394
Oh, no,
I'm not afraid.
Oh, dear, no.

1115
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:52,231
Only, you see, well,
they were talking
of having the police here.

1116
01:00:52,316 --> 01:00:54,400
And I wouldn't want
the police to suspect me.

1117
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:55,651
Why, they wouldn't
suspect you.

1118
01:00:55,736 --> 01:00:57,528
Oh, yes,
they would.

1119
01:00:57,738 --> 01:01:00,197
You see,
the last time
they suspected me,

1120
01:01:00,282 --> 01:01:01,282
I got four years.

1121
01:01:01,366 --> 01:01:02,783
Hives!

1122
01:01:02,868 --> 01:01:03,868
All right, Hives.

1123
01:01:03,952 --> 01:01:05,578
Give me the painting
and I'll take care of it.

1124
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:06,871
Good. Come.

1125
01:01:18,884 --> 01:01:21,010
Good heavens!
It's gone!
Gone?

1126
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,762
I left it in there.
There?

1127
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:25,639
There must be
thieves at this party.
Oh, God!

1128
01:01:25,724 --> 01:01:28,434
If I'd known that,
I never would
have come.

1129
01:01:28,518 --> 01:01:31,187
Wait a minute.
That professor.

1130
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:33,647
The professor!
I see!

1131
01:01:33,815 --> 01:01:36,192
Hives, that's the fellow
in the woodpile. Now, listen.

1132
01:01:36,276 --> 01:01:39,111
We've got to get
that picture
away from him!

1133
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:42,656
Might I suggest
some of this?

1134
01:01:42,908 --> 01:01:45,326
What...
Oh, very satisfactory
in these cases.

1135
01:01:45,410 --> 01:01:47,161
A few drops
on a handkerchief

1136
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:50,164
and the professor
will no longer
obstruct us.

1137
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,166
You are sure
it'll do the trick?

1138
01:01:52,250 --> 01:01:53,667
Oh, absolutely.

1139
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,503
Would you care
to try some?

1140
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:58,381
No, thanks, Hives.
Let's find
the professor.

1141
01:02:07,682 --> 01:02:09,183
I don't see how the thief
could have gotten away.

1142
01:02:09,267 --> 01:02:10,267
I wonder who
it could have been.

1143
01:02:10,352 --> 01:02:12,186
It's a good thing
we substituted yours.

1144
01:02:12,270 --> 01:02:14,855
Suppose that the thief
had gotten away
with the Beaugard!

1145
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:17,191
Oh, it would
be all right
if they stole mine.

1146
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:19,360
Oh, darling,
I... I didn't
mean that.

1147
01:02:19,444 --> 01:02:21,362
But what would
mother do?

1148
01:02:21,446 --> 01:02:23,697
Why, it's worth
$100,000!

1149
01:02:23,782 --> 01:02:25,616
How could she have
replaced it?

1150
01:02:25,700 --> 01:02:27,618
Oh, I understand, dear.

1151
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,123
Isn't it exciting?
Just think.

1152
01:02:32,457 --> 01:02:35,376
Whoever took it
was right in the room
with us!

1153
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:37,128
Just like Raffles.

1154
01:02:37,629 --> 01:02:39,547
Oh, isn't it
romantic?

1155
01:02:43,468 --> 01:02:46,554
All the boys I've known

1156
01:02:46,805 --> 01:02:49,515
Used to say
I was made of stone

1157
01:02:50,308 --> 01:02:53,185
I would always
leave them alone

1158
01:02:53,937 --> 01:02:55,896
In despair

1159
01:02:57,149 --> 01:02:59,650
I've been on the pan

1160
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,903
I've been called
an electric fan

1161
01:03:03,655 --> 01:03:06,574
Told I'm even much
colder than

1162
01:03:07,242 --> 01:03:08,951
Frigidaire

1163
01:03:10,454 --> 01:03:12,288
I began to wonder

1164
01:03:12,581 --> 01:03:15,374
If I was all wrong

1165
01:03:15,584 --> 01:03:22,047
I thought so
till you came along

1166
01:03:23,758 --> 01:03:25,384
Tell me, dear

1167
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,721
Why am I so romantic

1168
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:32,016
When you're near

1169
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,269
Why am I so romantic

1170
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,565
What a grand feeling

1171
01:03:39,900 --> 01:03:42,276
When your lips
meet mine

1172
01:03:42,360 --> 01:03:44,945
That certain
something comes

1173
01:03:45,030 --> 01:03:49,533
Stealing up and down
my spine

1174
01:03:49,910 --> 01:03:54,038
I don't know
what it is you do to me

1175
01:03:56,291 --> 01:04:00,794
You don't know half
of the good you do me

1176
01:04:02,881 --> 01:04:05,716
Other boys bore me

1177
01:04:06,009 --> 01:04:08,552
They just
leave me blue

1178
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:14,558
But why am I
so romantic

1179
01:04:14,809 --> 01:04:17,353
With you

1180
01:04:20,065 --> 01:04:21,690
Tell me, dear

1181
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:25,402
Why am I so romantic

1182
01:04:26,571 --> 01:04:28,155
When you're near

1183
01:04:28,240 --> 01:04:31,575
Why am I so romantic

1184
01:04:33,203 --> 01:04:35,871
What a grand feeling

1185
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:38,457
When your lips
touch mine

1186
01:04:38,542 --> 01:04:41,252
That certain
something comes

1187
01:04:41,336 --> 01:04:45,256
Stealing up and down
my spine

1188
01:04:46,007 --> 01:04:49,009
When we pet
close in your arms

1189
01:04:49,094 --> 01:04:51,095
You hold me

1190
01:04:52,514 --> 01:04:57,059
I forget all that
my mother told me

1191
01:04:59,062 --> 01:05:01,897
Other girls bore me

1192
01:05:02,315 --> 01:05:04,441
They just leave me blue

1193
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:11,115
But why am I so romantic

1194
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:16,453
With you

1195
01:09:08,102 --> 01:09:10,229
Oh, Signor Ravelli.
Ah, how do you do?

1196
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:11,730
I've been looking
for you all morning.

1197
01:09:12,023 --> 01:09:14,399
I was busy all morning,
but you could have
had me last night.

1198
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:16,944
Signor Ravelli,
you've gotta put
that painting back.

1199
01:09:17,028 --> 01:09:18,987
Painting? Painting?
What painting?
What are you talking?

1200
01:09:19,072 --> 01:09:22,032
The one you
changed last night,
you remember?

1201
01:09:22,200 --> 01:09:24,284
Oh, you mean
the picture?
Yes.

1202
01:09:24,369 --> 01:09:25,369
Hey, what's
the matter for you?

1203
01:09:25,453 --> 01:09:27,287
First you want them
downstairs, then you
want them upstairs.

1204
01:09:27,372 --> 01:09:28,372
Then you want
them downstairs,
then you...

1205
01:09:28,456 --> 01:09:29,540
Come on,
make up your mind.

1206
01:09:29,624 --> 01:09:31,166
Oh, I do thank you
for what you've done.

1207
01:09:31,251 --> 01:09:34,586
But you've got to get
that painting back
before the police get here.

1208
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:35,754
Police?
Yes!

1209
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:36,797
They come here?
Yes!

1210
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,216
Wait, I give it to you,
you put it back.
Come on, come on.

1211
01:09:45,223 --> 01:09:47,266
Where's the picture?
What do you mean,
"Where's the picture"?

1212
01:09:47,350 --> 01:09:49,977
I put him in there.
It's gone.
Somebody take him.

1213
01:09:50,061 --> 01:09:51,353
You take him!
Me?

1214
01:09:51,396 --> 01:09:52,980
No, I know.
I know.
I...

1215
01:09:53,064 --> 01:09:55,023
The fish peddler.
Abie, the fish peddler.

1216
01:09:55,108 --> 01:09:57,359
Did mother invite
a fish peddler here?

1217
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,778
I don't know
whether she invite,
but he's here.

1218
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:01,655
Come on.
We find him.

1219
01:10:03,908 --> 01:10:05,158
Good morning,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1220
01:10:05,243 --> 01:10:06,493
Good morning,
Mr. Jamison.

1221
01:10:06,578 --> 01:10:08,120
And how is
Captain Spaulding
this morning?

1222
01:10:08,204 --> 01:10:09,872
Oh, he had
a very bad night.

1223
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:11,039
He didn't sleep
a wink.

1224
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,333
He went horseback riding
in the middle of the night.

1225
01:10:13,418 --> 01:10:14,710
I'm sorry.
Yes, I know.

1226
01:10:14,752 --> 01:10:16,503
But we've all
been very upset.
Bad case. Yeah.

1227
01:10:16,588 --> 01:10:18,547
Uh, good morning,
Captain.

1228
01:10:18,756 --> 01:10:20,716
Did you enjoy
your ride?

1229
01:10:23,052 --> 01:10:25,012
What in the world
are you looking for?

1230
01:10:25,096 --> 01:10:26,847
I lost my horse.
Oh!

1231
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:29,933
Yes, he slipped
right out from
between me.

1232
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:33,437
I can't understand it.
I had my feet
in the syrups, too.

1233
01:10:33,521 --> 01:10:34,646
I don't know.
I don't know
how he got...

1234
01:10:34,731 --> 01:10:36,857
I didn't care about that,
but I lost the bit
you loaned me.

1235
01:10:36,941 --> 01:10:38,942
Never mind.
I'll get you
another bit.

1236
01:10:39,110 --> 01:10:41,320
Well, that'll be
two bits I owe you, then.

1237
01:10:41,404 --> 01:10:43,697
Captain, I hope you
weren't distressed

1238
01:10:43,781 --> 01:10:45,699
by last night's
unfortunate occurrence.

1239
01:10:45,783 --> 01:10:47,117
You mean
that dinner
you served?

1240
01:10:47,201 --> 01:10:48,452
No, the painting
that was stolen.

1241
01:10:48,536 --> 01:10:49,536
Was there
a painting stolen?

1242
01:10:49,621 --> 01:10:50,787
I haven't seen a paper
in three weeks.

1243
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:54,041
Jamison, as my secretary,
why didn't you inform me
there was a painting stolen?

1244
01:10:54,125 --> 01:10:55,417
What do you think
I engaged you for?

1245
01:10:55,501 --> 01:10:56,585
But, Captain,
I didn't know it.

1246
01:10:56,669 --> 01:10:58,879
Well, you should
have asked me.
I didn't know it!

1247
01:10:59,005 --> 01:11:00,839
- Well, I'm sorry.
- You're sorry.

1248
01:11:00,965 --> 01:11:02,633
You're a contemptible cur!

1249
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:05,552
I repeat, sir,
you're a contemptible cur!

1250
01:11:05,637 --> 01:11:07,804
Oh, if I were a man
you'd resent that.

1251
01:11:08,264 --> 01:11:10,349
Please keep quiet,
will you?

1252
01:11:10,642 --> 01:11:11,725
I can get along
without you, you know.

1253
01:11:11,809 --> 01:11:14,311
I got along without
your father, didn't I?
Yes, and your grandfather.

1254
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:16,438
Yes, and your uncle!
Yes, and your uncle!

1255
01:11:16,522 --> 01:11:17,856
Yes, and my uncle.
Captain!

1256
01:11:17,941 --> 01:11:19,816
I didn't come here
to be exonerated.

1257
01:11:19,901 --> 01:11:21,568
I beg pardon,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1258
01:11:21,653 --> 01:11:22,903
Oh, you do, eh?

1259
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:26,323
Well, I'd like
to see you crawl
out of a rumble seat.

1260
01:11:27,867 --> 01:11:29,409
The police
are here, madam.

1261
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,078
Oh, the police.
Have them come in.

1262
01:11:31,162 --> 01:11:32,579
Oh, so, that's
your game, is it?

1263
01:11:32,664 --> 01:11:33,914
You can't
shut me up.

1264
01:11:33,998 --> 01:11:35,999
Captain.
No! You can talk
to my attorney.

1265
01:11:36,084 --> 01:11:37,084
Jamison?
Yes, sir.

1266
01:11:37,168 --> 01:11:38,168
Take a letter
to my lawyers.

1267
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,671
I'll show you
a thing or two,
or three.

1268
01:11:41,547 --> 01:11:42,881
I'll show you
a thing or three.

1269
01:11:42,966 --> 01:11:44,424
Oh, Captain.
Sending for the police.

1270
01:11:44,509 --> 01:11:46,468
Take a letter
to my lawyers!

1271
01:11:46,552 --> 01:11:48,345
Sending for the police, eh?

1272
01:11:48,429 --> 01:11:50,138
I say,
take a letter
to my lawyers!

1273
01:11:50,223 --> 01:11:51,473
I am taking it!

1274
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:53,934
Uh, read me
what you have so far.

1275
01:11:55,853 --> 01:11:58,271
Honorable
Charles H. Hungerdunger,

1276
01:11:58,648 --> 01:12:01,566
in care of Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger and McCormick.

1277
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:04,987
Semicolon.

1278
01:12:05,947 --> 01:12:07,948
How do you spell
"semicolon"?

1279
01:12:08,032 --> 01:12:10,033
All right,
make it a comma.

1280
01:12:12,829 --> 01:12:16,039
Dear, Elsie...
No, never mind Elsie.

1281
01:12:17,917 --> 01:12:20,002
Do you want me to
scratch "Elsie"?

1282
01:12:20,086 --> 01:12:22,796
Well, if you enjoy
that sort of thing,
it's quite all right with me.

1283
01:12:22,880 --> 01:12:25,799
However, I'm not interested
in your private
affairs, Jamison.

1284
01:12:25,883 --> 01:12:28,677
Begin this way.
Let's start all over again.

1285
01:12:28,761 --> 01:12:29,886
Honorable
Charles H. Hungerdunger,

1286
01:12:29,971 --> 01:12:32,973
in care of Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger and McCormick.

1287
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:35,058
Gentlemen,
question mark.

1288
01:12:37,395 --> 01:12:40,147
- Do you want that, uh...
- in the letter?

1289
01:12:40,231 --> 01:12:42,315
No, put that
in an envelope.

1290
01:12:42,442 --> 01:12:44,234
Now, then,

1291
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:46,153
in re yours
of the fifth inst.

1292
01:12:46,237 --> 01:12:48,405
Yours to hand
and beg to rep.

1293
01:12:49,240 --> 01:12:50,574
Brackets.

1294
01:12:50,908 --> 01:12:53,201
That, uh,
we have gone over
the ground carefully

1295
01:12:53,286 --> 01:12:54,828
and we seem to believe,

1296
01:12:54,912 --> 01:12:57,456
I-E, to wit,
E-G, in lieu,

1297
01:12:58,249 --> 01:13:01,668
that, uh,
despite all our
precautionary measures

1298
01:13:01,753 --> 01:13:03,712
which have
been involved...

1299
01:13:04,714 --> 01:13:05,797
Uh...

1300
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:08,341
We seem to believe
that it is hardly
necessary

1301
01:13:08,426 --> 01:13:12,471
for us to proceed
unless we receive
an ipso facto

1302
01:13:12,722 --> 01:13:15,057
that is not negligible
at this moment.

1303
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:17,267
Quotes, unquotes
and quotes.

1304
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,687
Uh, hoping
this finds you,
I beg you to remain...

1305
01:13:20,772 --> 01:13:22,397
Hoping this
finds him where?

1306
01:13:22,482 --> 01:13:24,316
Well, let him
worry about that.

1307
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:26,526
Don't be
so inquisitive,
Jamison.

1308
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:27,819
Sneak!

1309
01:13:28,446 --> 01:13:29,529
I say, hoping
this finds you,

1310
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:32,324
I beg to remain,
as of June 9th,
cordially yours. Regards.

1311
01:13:32,408 --> 01:13:33,617
That's all, Jamison.

1312
01:13:33,701 --> 01:13:35,327
I'll show you
where I get off.

1313
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:37,788
Sending for the police.

1314
01:13:38,372 --> 01:13:40,373
Now read me
the letter,
Jamison.

1315
01:13:40,458 --> 01:13:42,626
"Honorable Charles
H. Hungadunga..."

1316
01:13:42,710 --> 01:13:44,294
"Hungerdunger."

1317
01:13:44,754 --> 01:13:46,171
"Hunga... Hun."
"Hunga..."

1318
01:13:46,297 --> 01:13:48,507
"Hungerdunger."
That's it.
"Hungerdunger."

1319
01:13:48,591 --> 01:13:52,511
"In care of Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger
and McCormick."

1320
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:54,930
You've left out
a "Hungerdunger."

1321
01:13:55,223 --> 01:13:57,432
You left out
the main one, too.

1322
01:13:58,059 --> 01:14:00,852
Thought you could
slip one over on me, eh?

1323
01:14:01,646 --> 01:14:04,815
All right, leave it out
and put in a windshield
wiper instead.

1324
01:14:04,899 --> 01:14:07,025
I'll tell you
what you do, Jamison.
I'll tell you what.

1325
01:14:07,110 --> 01:14:10,278
Make it, uh, make it
three windshield wipers
and one "Hungerdunger."

1326
01:14:10,363 --> 01:14:13,156
They won't all be there
when the letter
arrives anyhow.

1327
01:14:13,533 --> 01:14:15,575
"Hungerdunger, Hungerdunger,
Hungerdunger and McCormick."

1328
01:14:15,660 --> 01:14:16,868
"And McCormick."

1329
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,787
"Dear Elsie, scratch."

1330
01:14:18,871 --> 01:14:19,913
That won't do, Jamison.

1331
01:14:19,997 --> 01:14:22,290
That won't go
through the mail,
the way you got it.

1332
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:25,377
The way you've got the letter,
you've got
McCormick scratching Elsie.

1333
01:14:25,461 --> 01:14:28,421
Now you better
turn that around and
have Elsie scratch McCormick.

1334
01:14:28,506 --> 01:14:30,799
And you better turn McCormick
around, too, Jamison.

1335
01:14:30,883 --> 01:14:32,384
And see what
you can do for me.

1336
01:14:33,553 --> 01:14:34,803
"Gentlemen,
question mark."

1337
01:14:34,887 --> 01:14:36,763
"Gentlemen,
question mark"?

1338
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:39,683
Put it on the penultimate,
not on the diphthongic.

1339
01:14:39,767 --> 01:14:41,852
You wanna brush up
on your Greek, Jamison.

1340
01:14:41,936 --> 01:14:44,396
Well, get a Greek
and brush up on him.

1341
01:14:44,480 --> 01:14:46,940
"In re yours
of the fifth inst."
I see.

1342
01:14:47,024 --> 01:14:50,026
Now, you said a lot
of things here

1343
01:14:50,111 --> 01:14:51,403
that I didn't think
were important,

1344
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,155
so I just
omitted them.

1345
01:14:53,239 --> 01:14:54,698
Well!
Hmm.

1346
01:14:58,536 --> 01:15:00,745
Oh, Captain!
Good gracious!

1347
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:01,913
Oh, my!

1348
01:15:02,165 --> 01:15:04,374
So, you've just
omitted them, eh?

1349
01:15:04,667 --> 01:15:07,127
You've just omitted
the body of the letter,
that's all.

1350
01:15:07,211 --> 01:15:09,796
You've left out the body
of the letter, that's all.

1351
01:15:09,881 --> 01:15:11,673
Yours is not
to reason why,
Jamison!

1352
01:15:11,757 --> 01:15:14,384
You've left out
the body of the letter!

1353
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:18,638
All right, send it that way
and tell them
the body will follow.

1354
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:22,434
Do you want
the body
in brackets?

1355
01:15:22,643 --> 01:15:24,477
No, it'll never
get there in brackets.

1356
01:15:24,562 --> 01:15:25,896
Put it in a box.

1357
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,899
Put it in a box
and mark it,
uh, "fragilly."

1358
01:15:30,568 --> 01:15:31,651
Mark it what?

1359
01:15:31,736 --> 01:15:35,071
Mark it "fragilly."
F-R-A-G...

1360
01:15:35,740 --> 01:15:39,075
Look it up, Jamison.
It's in the dictionary.
Look under "fragile."

1361
01:15:39,952 --> 01:15:42,746
Look under the table
if you don't find it there.

1362
01:15:42,872 --> 01:15:45,207
Uh, "Quotes,
unquotes,
and quotes."

1363
01:15:45,291 --> 01:15:46,791
That's three quotes?
Yes, sir.

1364
01:15:46,876 --> 01:15:48,627
Add another quote
and make it a gallon.

1365
01:15:48,753 --> 01:15:50,754
How much is it,
a gallon, Jamison?
Regards.

1366
01:15:50,880 --> 01:15:53,048
Regards. That's
a fine letter, Jamison.
That's an epic.

1367
01:15:53,132 --> 01:15:54,132
That's dandy.

1368
01:15:54,217 --> 01:15:56,301
Now, I want you
to make two carbon
copies of that letter

1369
01:15:56,385 --> 01:15:57,844
and throw
the original away.

1370
01:15:57,929 --> 01:16:00,180
And when you
get through with that,
throw the carbon copies away.

1371
01:16:00,264 --> 01:16:01,723
Just send
a stamp airmail.
And that's all.

1372
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,183
You may go,
Jamison.
I may go, too.

1373
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:05,393
Mrs. Rittenhouse?

1374
01:16:05,478 --> 01:16:07,687
Yes?
I'm Inspector Hennessey
from headquarters.

1375
01:16:07,772 --> 01:16:08,772
How do you do,
Inspector?

1376
01:16:08,856 --> 01:16:09,940
Let me
introduce myself.

1377
01:16:10,024 --> 01:16:11,900
I'm Captain Scotland
of Spaulding Yard.

1378
01:16:11,984 --> 01:16:14,027
No, I'm Captain Spaulding
of Scotland Yard.

1379
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:15,445
Please don't make
the same mistake again.

1380
01:16:15,529 --> 01:16:16,863
I'm glad to know you,
Captain.

1381
01:16:16,948 --> 01:16:18,406
Well, I should think
you would be.

1382
01:16:18,491 --> 01:16:19,950
Now, then, inspector,
I think between
the two of us

1383
01:16:20,034 --> 01:16:21,618
we can solve the mystery
of the stolen painting.

1384
01:16:21,702 --> 01:16:22,744
Especially,
if you go home.

1385
01:16:23,371 --> 01:16:27,040
Inspector, please
don't be too hasty
about making an arrest.

1386
01:16:27,124 --> 01:16:28,875
I don't want
my guests embarrassed.

1387
01:16:29,126 --> 01:16:30,085
Don't worry.

1388
01:16:30,169 --> 01:16:31,878
We won't
arrest anybody.

1389
01:16:31,963 --> 01:16:33,505
He's lucky
if he can stay out
of jail himself.

1390
01:16:34,006 --> 01:16:36,841
Mr. Jamison,
would you mind taking
the inspector and his men

1391
01:16:36,968 --> 01:16:39,844
to the library
and showing them
the scene of the crime?

1392
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:41,221
Certainly,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1393
01:16:41,305 --> 01:16:42,555
Right this way,
Inspector.

1394
01:16:42,640 --> 01:16:44,140
Come on, boys.

1395
01:16:49,522 --> 01:16:51,773
And, Jamison,
count the spoons.

1396
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:55,318
Captain, I didn't know
you'd been a detective.

1397
01:16:55,403 --> 01:16:57,404
There's a whole lot
of things you don't know.

1398
01:16:57,488 --> 01:16:58,738
I suppose that's so.

1399
01:16:58,823 --> 01:17:00,448
You know darn well
it's so.

1400
01:17:00,533 --> 01:17:03,368
Where were you
on the night
of June 5, 1774?

1401
01:17:03,661 --> 01:17:04,786
I'm afraid
I don't know.

1402
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:06,788
You bet you
don't know.
Where was I?

1403
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:07,872
I don't know.

1404
01:17:07,957 --> 01:17:10,250
Well, I don't know, either.
And if I did know
I wouldn't tell you.

1405
01:17:10,334 --> 01:17:12,043
Put that
in your pipe
and smoke it.

1406
01:17:12,128 --> 01:17:13,712
Take a number
from one to 10.

1407
01:17:13,838 --> 01:17:16,006
All right.
All right.
What's the number?

1408
01:17:16,132 --> 01:17:18,133
Seven.
That's right.
Seven is right.

1409
01:17:18,217 --> 01:17:20,176
I could have done it
with one hand
if I wanted.

1410
01:17:20,261 --> 01:17:23,805
This is no mystery. I could
solve this in five minutes
if I wanted to worry.

1411
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:26,308
Captain, I don't
want you to worry.

1412
01:17:26,392 --> 01:17:28,977
I don't want
anything to interfere
with your weekend.

1413
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:30,478
Nothing ever
interferes with
my weekend,

1414
01:17:30,563 --> 01:17:32,397
and I'll thank you
not to get personal,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1415
01:17:32,523 --> 01:17:34,024
Captain.
Captain, I assure you...
Where's my secretary?

1416
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,483
I didn't mean...
No, no. Where's
my secretary?

1417
01:17:35,609 --> 01:17:37,986
Jamison, Jamison?
Captain, you
misunderstood me.

1418
01:17:38,112 --> 01:17:39,654
Oh!
A more
dastardly crack

1419
01:17:39,739 --> 01:17:41,114
I've never heard.
Oh. Captain, please.

1420
01:17:41,198 --> 01:17:43,658
I wish I was back
in the jungle where
men are monkeys.

1421
01:17:43,784 --> 01:17:45,410
Captain,
I'm so sorry.
Jamison!

1422
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,329
Jamison? No.
Oh, Captain.

1423
01:17:47,413 --> 01:17:48,496
Oh, dear.
No!

1424
01:17:48,581 --> 01:17:51,416
Good morning,
Mrs. Rittenhouse.

1425
01:17:51,751 --> 01:17:52,792
Good morning.

1426
01:17:52,877 --> 01:17:54,294
Perfectly
charming party.

1427
01:17:54,378 --> 01:17:56,796
I wouldn't
have missed it
for the world.

1428
01:17:56,881 --> 01:17:58,965
It's just full
of surprises.

1429
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,593
So glad you're
enjoying yourself.

1430
01:18:04,263 --> 01:18:05,930
Oh, Hives. Hives!

1431
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:09,309
Good morning.
Some breakfast?

1432
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:11,519
Breakfast, nothing.
Did you get
the painting?

1433
01:18:11,604 --> 01:18:13,480
No, I did not.
I watched all night,

1434
01:18:13,564 --> 01:18:15,148
but the professor
did not sleep

1435
01:18:15,232 --> 01:18:16,441
in his room.
No?

1436
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,318
Strange.
Very strange.

1437
01:18:18,402 --> 01:18:20,320
Good heavens, Hives!
What will we do?

1438
01:18:20,404 --> 01:18:23,156
I don't know.
Until we see
the professor.

1439
01:18:58,859 --> 01:19:00,276
You keep
an eye on him

1440
01:19:00,361 --> 01:19:02,028
till I get back
with the bottle.

1441
01:19:02,113 --> 01:19:05,323
Don't worry,
he'll not get away
from me this time.

1442
01:19:15,960 --> 01:19:17,544
Did you get it?
Good.
Yes, madam.

1443
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:20,004
Now, I'll go ahead
and engage him
in conversation.

1444
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,381
You'll trail behind,

1445
01:19:21,465 --> 01:19:24,759
and when the proper
time comes,
see that he gets it.

1446
01:19:25,261 --> 01:19:26,886
Very good,
madam.

1447
01:19:30,975 --> 01:19:33,268
Oh, hello.
I've been looking
all over for you.

1448
01:19:33,352 --> 01:19:34,727
Where have
you been?

1449
01:19:34,812 --> 01:19:36,354
What is the matter
with this?

1450
01:19:36,814 --> 01:19:39,107
What have
you got there,
the morning papers?

1451
01:19:39,191 --> 01:19:41,234
No, that isn't
the one I want.

1452
01:19:41,318 --> 01:19:43,486
Let me see
one of the others.

1453
01:19:44,655 --> 01:19:46,948
That still isn't
the one I want.

1454
01:19:50,661 --> 01:19:53,079
You know what I want.

1455
01:20:03,174 --> 01:20:04,215
Out.

1456
01:20:05,968 --> 01:20:07,218
Yes, out.

1457
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:08,595
Never mind
the birds.

1458
01:20:08,679 --> 01:20:11,014
Come on up here.
Sit down. I want
to talk to you.

1459
01:20:15,936 --> 01:20:17,604
Don't you like me?

1460
01:20:18,314 --> 01:20:19,647
You don't?

1461
01:20:19,940 --> 01:20:21,274
Well, I like you.

1462
01:20:21,358 --> 01:20:23,443
I like little boys
like you.

1463
01:20:24,361 --> 01:20:26,946
By the way,
how old are you?

1464
01:20:28,574 --> 01:20:29,949
Five years old?

1465
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:32,535
Why you're just a baby,
aren't you?

1466
01:20:37,208 --> 01:20:39,000
Oh!

1467
01:20:40,085 --> 01:20:42,295
Aw, isn't
that nice?
I like that.

1468
01:20:43,631 --> 01:20:45,340
No, no, no!

1469
01:20:46,383 --> 01:20:47,967
Now, all
joking aside.

1470
01:20:48,052 --> 01:20:50,261
Isn't there someone
you do like?

1471
01:20:50,888 --> 01:20:53,056
Isn't there
someone you love?

1472
01:20:54,225 --> 01:20:55,475
Now think again.

1473
01:20:55,559 --> 01:20:58,478
Isn't there
someone you really
and truly love?

1474
01:20:59,438 --> 01:21:00,730
Is there?

1475
01:21:01,649 --> 01:21:03,066
Tell me who.

1476
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:11,157
Why, that's a horse.
You love a horse.

1477
01:21:19,750 --> 01:21:21,543
Come on.
Lift him up.

1478
01:21:26,757 --> 01:21:27,882
Come on, he's out.

1479
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:29,509
Let us get out.

1480
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,962
Arabella.

1481
01:22:06,046 --> 01:22:08,047
John, I've been
trying to find you.

1482
01:22:08,132 --> 01:22:09,674
Ravelli has lost
the painting.

1483
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:10,842
Well, I've been looking
all over for you.

1484
01:22:10,968 --> 01:22:12,844
I found a painting
out on the terrace.

1485
01:22:12,928 --> 01:22:14,220
Was it the Beaugard?
No.

1486
01:22:14,305 --> 01:22:15,805
Oh, yours!
Shh.

1487
01:22:18,892 --> 01:22:21,102
Well, if it's not yours
and it's not the Beaugard,

1488
01:22:21,186 --> 01:22:22,812
whose is it?
Where did it
come from?

1489
01:22:22,896 --> 01:22:24,814
Oh, don't you see?
Someone else came along

1490
01:22:24,898 --> 01:22:26,858
and substituted it
for mine,

1491
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:29,319
thinking they were
getting away with
the original Beaugard.

1492
01:22:29,403 --> 01:22:32,030
Somebody swiped
my scheme, eh?

1493
01:22:32,489 --> 01:22:36,326
Hey, then Chandler never saw
your painting after all.
No!

1494
01:22:36,535 --> 01:22:39,078
For all I know you may
still be a great artist.

1495
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:42,081
Where is
this picture?
It's up in my room.

1496
01:22:42,166 --> 01:22:44,917
Well, you go get it
and I'll get
Captain Spaulding.

1497
01:22:45,002 --> 01:22:47,253
He'll get to
the bottom of this.

1498
01:22:59,350 --> 01:23:01,267
And then
John found
a third painting.

1499
01:23:01,352 --> 01:23:02,518
Well, that's
very interesting.

1500
01:23:02,603 --> 01:23:03,603
Well, fairly
interesting.

1501
01:23:03,687 --> 01:23:05,772
But we've just got
to keep a sharp lookout.
That's all.

1502
01:23:05,856 --> 01:23:07,023
Oh, I've got
to find it

1503
01:23:07,107 --> 01:23:09,067
or mother's
out of $100,000.

1504
01:23:09,151 --> 01:23:11,402
Now, don't worry.
Let me work on this case
for 24 hours,

1505
01:23:11,487 --> 01:23:12,820
and then we'll call in
somebody else.

1506
01:23:12,905 --> 01:23:13,946
You think it's
a mystery now?

1507
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:15,281
Wait till you'll
see it tomorrow.

1508
01:23:15,366 --> 01:23:17,116
Remember
the Charley Ross
disappearance?

1509
01:23:17,201 --> 01:23:18,826
I worked
on that case
for 24 hours

1510
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:20,036
and they never
did find him.

1511
01:23:20,120 --> 01:23:21,746
They couldn't find me
for five years.

1512
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:23,623
That's me, Captain Yard
of Scotland Spaulding.

1513
01:23:23,707 --> 01:23:25,291
I always get my women.
Or paintings.

1514
01:23:25,376 --> 01:23:27,460
Arabella!
Can you imagine
what's happened?

1515
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,212
You know
that painting I found?
Yes?

1516
01:23:29,254 --> 01:23:31,297
Well, it's been stolen
from my room.
John!

1517
01:23:31,382 --> 01:23:33,299
There you are.
I've been on the case
five minutes

1518
01:23:33,384 --> 01:23:34,467
and there's another
painting gone.

1519
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:35,635
I'll bet it's not
even five minutes.

1520
01:23:35,719 --> 01:23:37,804
I'll bet it
not over three.

1521
01:23:38,389 --> 01:23:40,848
Now they've
got my watch!
This is going too far.

1522
01:23:40,933 --> 01:23:43,017
It wasn't going
and now it's gone.

1523
01:23:43,102 --> 01:23:44,644
The door to my room
was locked, too!

1524
01:23:44,728 --> 01:23:46,104
Well, how could
they get in?

1525
01:23:46,188 --> 01:23:47,355
Who could
it have been?

1526
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,357
Wait a minute.
I think
I've got a clue.

1527
01:23:49,441 --> 01:23:51,192
No, it's a hair.
A red hair.

1528
01:23:51,735 --> 01:23:53,194
The professor?

1529
01:23:53,278 --> 01:23:55,279
Oh, no.
No, it couldn't be.

1530
01:23:55,447 --> 01:23:57,740
Well, he's been
picked this month by
the Crook of the Month Club.

1531
01:23:57,825 --> 01:24:00,034
Anyhow, we'll
investigate it.

1532
01:24:03,706 --> 01:24:04,831
You know
Conductor Hennessey,
don't you?

1533
01:24:04,915 --> 01:24:06,916
Inspector!
Inspector yourself.

1534
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:08,584
Now, listen,
you know that little
redheaded fellow?

1535
01:24:08,669 --> 01:24:10,169
The professor?
Yes.

1536
01:24:10,254 --> 01:24:12,088
Well, get that gang
of flagpole sitters
of yours

1537
01:24:12,172 --> 01:24:13,339
and see if you
can find him.

1538
01:24:13,424 --> 01:24:14,924
Aye, aye, Captain.
Come on, boys.

1539
01:24:16,969 --> 01:24:19,178
He'll get
to the bottom
of this.

1540
01:24:19,263 --> 01:24:21,139
You'll see
how quick
these boys...

1541
01:24:21,223 --> 01:24:23,641
Hey, what's that punk
doing there?

1542
01:24:25,519 --> 01:24:27,770
They're good policemen.
Didn't take long
to find him.

1543
01:24:27,855 --> 01:24:29,272
That's right.
This is it.

1544
01:24:29,356 --> 01:24:31,858
Yeah, this is it.
But which one is it?

1545
01:24:31,942 --> 01:24:34,110
That's the one
that was just taken
from my room!

1546
01:24:34,194 --> 01:24:35,194
Well, we've got
that back.

1547
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,404
Maybe I got
my watch back.

1548
01:24:36,488 --> 01:24:38,281
Now, the fob is gone.

1549
01:24:39,783 --> 01:24:41,909
Well, I still got
the pocket.

1550
01:24:42,286 --> 01:24:44,203
Anything I retain now
is velvet.

1551
01:24:44,288 --> 01:24:46,372
Except the coat.
That's Prince Albert.

1552
01:24:46,457 --> 01:24:47,749
Well, all the jokes
can't be good.

1553
01:24:47,833 --> 01:24:49,292
You've gotta
expect that
once in a while.

1554
01:24:49,626 --> 01:24:52,378
Say, if we could find
the fellow that painted
this picture,

1555
01:24:52,463 --> 01:24:54,172
well, we'd have
a pretty good clue.

1556
01:24:54,298 --> 01:24:56,591
What'd you say?
I said if we could
find the fellow

1557
01:24:56,675 --> 01:24:59,218
that painted
this picture, we'd have
a pretty good clue.

1558
01:24:59,303 --> 01:25:00,678
You just
said that!

1559
01:25:00,763 --> 01:25:03,973
What a dull
conversationalist
you turned out to be.

1560
01:25:04,391 --> 01:25:06,768
Let me see
that a minute.
Will you?

1561
01:25:06,852 --> 01:25:08,478
Say, this is signed
"Beaugard."

1562
01:25:08,562 --> 01:25:09,729
There's
the criminal,
Beaugard.

1563
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:11,773
No, Beaugard
is dead!

1564
01:25:11,899 --> 01:25:14,233
Beaugard is dead?
Then it's murder!

1565
01:25:14,318 --> 01:25:16,360
Now we've got something.
What you got, Captain?

1566
01:25:16,445 --> 01:25:17,779
I got jacks and aces.
What do you got?

1567
01:25:17,863 --> 01:25:18,946
That's good.
I was bluffing.

1568
01:25:19,031 --> 01:25:20,573
Look at this, Ravelli.
Isn't there something

1569
01:25:20,657 --> 01:25:22,283
strikes you very funny
about this picture?

1570
01:25:24,453 --> 01:25:26,788
Oh, come, come.
It isn't as funny
as all that.

1571
01:25:26,872 --> 01:25:29,081
Did you ever see
a tree like that?

1572
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:31,042
Tree? That's
a spinach.

1573
01:25:31,376 --> 01:25:34,003
That can't be spinach.
Where's the egg?

1574
01:25:34,254 --> 01:25:36,923
Well, it could be spinach.
Look, all the sand
laying around there.

1575
01:25:37,007 --> 01:25:38,633
You mean,
it's an old
spinach custom?

1576
01:25:38,717 --> 01:25:39,884
No, it's not that,
Ravelli.

1577
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,177
Anything but that.
Oh. No, Cap.

1578
01:25:41,261 --> 01:25:42,720
That's all right.
It's my mistake.

1579
01:25:42,805 --> 01:25:44,430
You know
what that is?
That's coleslaw.

1580
01:25:44,515 --> 01:25:46,349
Coleslaw?
Yeah, it's a coleslaw.

1581
01:25:46,433 --> 01:25:47,934
Did you ever
see coleslaw
like that?

1582
01:25:48,018 --> 01:25:49,894
Sure, look
at this one.

1583
01:25:50,103 --> 01:25:51,729
No, I don't want one
on your lip, now.

1584
01:25:51,814 --> 01:25:53,439
Did you ever see
anything like that?

1585
01:25:53,524 --> 01:25:55,107
Did you ever see
anything like that?

1586
01:25:55,192 --> 01:25:56,317
You know
what this is?

1587
01:25:56,401 --> 01:25:57,652
This is a left-handed
painting.

1588
01:25:57,736 --> 01:25:58,820
Look, there's
a signature.

1589
01:25:58,904 --> 01:26:00,279
That's right, it's in
the right-hand corner.

1590
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,240
That's right.
This is either
a left-handed painting

1591
01:26:02,324 --> 01:26:03,533
or a vegetable dinner.

1592
01:26:03,617 --> 01:26:05,993
Now, if we can find
the left-handed person
that painted this,

1593
01:26:06,078 --> 01:26:07,954
we'll have
The Trial of Mary Dugan
with sound.

1594
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:09,539
Well, I saw that.
Good-bye.

1595
01:26:09,623 --> 01:26:12,250
Now, you wait here.
I'm gonna need you.
Now, look.

1596
01:26:12,334 --> 01:26:14,377
We mustn't lose this.
This is evidence.

1597
01:26:14,461 --> 01:26:17,588
Now, take it to your room
and leave the door open
this time. We'll try that.

1598
01:26:17,673 --> 01:26:20,967
And not a word
about this to anybody,
not even to me.

1599
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:25,555
Ravelli, we have
got to find the
left-handed painting.

1600
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,306
Yes, the left-handed
painter.
Now in a case like this

1601
01:26:27,391 --> 01:26:29,600
the first thing to do
is to find the motive.

1602
01:26:29,685 --> 01:26:31,102
Now, what could
have been the motive
of the guy

1603
01:26:31,186 --> 01:26:32,937
who has swapped
the Beaugard?

1604
01:26:33,730 --> 01:26:35,356
I got it!
Robbery!

1605
01:26:36,441 --> 01:26:38,150
Would you mind
going out and crossing
the boulevard

1606
01:26:38,235 --> 01:26:40,069
when the lights
are against you?

1607
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,821
See, Cap,
sit down.

1608
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:44,448
You understand,
I got an idea
how to find this painting.

1609
01:26:44,992 --> 01:26:48,369
In a case like this
that is so mysterious,
you gotta get at the clues.

1610
01:26:48,453 --> 01:26:50,413
You gotta use
the Sherlock Holmes method.

1611
01:26:50,497 --> 01:26:52,123
Now, you go
about it like this.

1612
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:54,083
You say to yourself,
"What happened?"

1613
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,503
And the answer come back,
"Something was stolen."

1614
01:26:57,588 --> 01:27:00,673
Then you say to yourself,
"What was stolen?"

1615
01:27:00,757 --> 01:27:03,384
And the answer
come back,
"A painting."

1616
01:27:05,596 --> 01:27:07,805
What are you,
a ventriloquist?

1617
01:27:08,098 --> 01:27:11,642
Now you say to yourself,
"Where was this
painting stolen?"

1618
01:27:11,727 --> 01:27:14,437
And the answer
come back,
"In this house."

1619
01:27:14,646 --> 01:27:16,647
Now, so far
I'm right, eh?

1620
01:27:16,857 --> 01:27:18,024
Well, it's pretty hard
to be wrong

1621
01:27:18,108 --> 01:27:20,860
if you keep
answering yourself
all the time.

1622
01:27:20,944 --> 01:27:22,737
Now you go a little further,
and you say to yourself,

1623
01:27:22,821 --> 01:27:24,196
"Who stole the painting?"

1624
01:27:24,281 --> 01:27:26,407
This is a very, very
important question.

1625
01:27:26,491 --> 01:27:29,660
Captain, you get the answer,
you've got the solution
to the whole thing.

1626
01:27:29,745 --> 01:27:32,246
Especially if you
find the picture.

1627
01:27:32,331 --> 01:27:33,664
Now you take
all the clues.

1628
01:27:33,749 --> 01:27:35,666
You put them together.
What do you got, eh?

1629
01:27:35,792 --> 01:27:38,210
A bread pudding.
No, here's what we got.

1630
01:27:38,295 --> 01:27:39,462
Something was stolen.

1631
01:27:39,546 --> 01:27:41,672
Stolen where?
In this house.
Stolen by who?

1632
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:42,965
Somebody
in the house.

1633
01:27:43,050 --> 01:27:46,135
Now to find the painting,
you only gotta do is
go to everybody in the house

1634
01:27:46,219 --> 01:27:48,137
and ask them
if they took it.

1635
01:27:48,221 --> 01:27:51,849
You know, I could
rent you out as a decoy
for duck hunters?

1636
01:27:52,309 --> 01:27:53,726
You say you're gonna
go to everybody
in the house

1637
01:27:53,810 --> 01:27:55,561
and ask them
if they took
the painting?

1638
01:27:55,646 --> 01:27:57,521
Suppose nobody
in the house
took the painting.

1639
01:27:57,606 --> 01:27:59,190
Go to the house
next door.

1640
01:27:59,274 --> 01:28:00,274
That's great.

1641
01:28:00,359 --> 01:28:02,652
Suppose there isn't
any house next door.

1642
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:05,780
Well, then of course
we gotta build one.

1643
01:28:05,864 --> 01:28:09,200
Well, now you're talking.
What kind of house do you
think we ought put up?

1644
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:10,576
Well, I'll tell ya, Cap.

1645
01:28:10,661 --> 01:28:14,330
You see. My idea of a house
is something nice and small
and comfortable.

1646
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:15,539
That's the way
I feel about it.

1647
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:16,749
I don't want
anything elaborate.

1648
01:28:16,833 --> 01:28:18,417
Just a little place
that I can call home

1649
01:28:18,502 --> 01:28:20,711
and tell the wife
I won't be there
for dinner.

1650
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:23,214
I see. You just want
a telephone booth.

1651
01:28:23,298 --> 01:28:26,717
No, in that case,
I'll get in touch
with Chic Sales.

1652
01:28:26,802 --> 01:28:30,346
Now, what do you say, Cap,
we build right about here?

1653
01:28:30,430 --> 01:28:31,764
Here?
Yeah, right
about here.

1654
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:34,600
Oh, I'd like
something over here
if I could get it.

1655
01:28:34,685 --> 01:28:38,104
I don't like junior
crossing the tracks on
his way to the reform school.

1656
01:28:38,188 --> 01:28:40,272
I don't like junior
at all, as a matter
of fact.

1657
01:28:40,357 --> 01:28:42,942
All right, all right.
We got something
over there.

1658
01:28:43,026 --> 01:28:46,612
And believe me,
that's convenient.
That's very convenient.

1659
01:28:46,697 --> 01:28:48,906
Well, all you gotta do
is open the door,

1660
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:50,950
step outside
and there you are.

1661
01:28:51,034 --> 01:28:52,201
There you are?
Yeah.

1662
01:28:52,285 --> 01:28:54,495
"There you
are" where?
Outside.

1663
01:28:55,414 --> 01:28:56,956
Well, suppose
you want to get
back in again?

1664
01:28:57,040 --> 01:28:58,833
You had no right
to go out.

1665
01:28:58,917 --> 01:29:02,169
Well, don't do
anything until I hear
from you, will you?

1666
01:29:02,254 --> 01:29:04,505
Say, maybe
that's the painting
down in the cellar!

1667
01:29:04,589 --> 01:29:06,590
That's no cellar.
That's the roof.

1668
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:07,800
That's the roof?
Down there?

1669
01:29:07,884 --> 01:29:09,719
Yeah, you see, we keep
the roof in the basement,

1670
01:29:09,803 --> 01:29:12,054
so when the rain comes,
the chimney don't get wet.

1671
01:29:13,056 --> 01:29:14,807
I'm going out
and get X-rayed.

1672
01:29:14,891 --> 01:29:16,851
I'll be back
in a little while.

1673
01:29:16,935 --> 01:29:19,145
I may be wonderful,
but I think
you're wrong, Ravelli.

1674
01:29:19,229 --> 01:29:21,981
Hey, wait,
don't get up excited.
Come here.

1675
01:29:22,065 --> 01:29:23,607
Now, look,
here's the rooms.

1676
01:29:23,734 --> 01:29:25,526
Those are the rooms?
Yeah. Right,
there's the rooms.

1677
01:29:25,610 --> 01:29:26,819
This is your room.

1678
01:29:26,903 --> 01:29:29,780
This is my room
and this is
the maid's room.

1679
01:29:30,032 --> 01:29:32,491
Oh, I'd have to go
through your room?

1680
01:29:35,078 --> 01:29:37,747
Ah! That's all right.
I won't be in it.

1681
01:29:38,248 --> 01:29:39,665
Say, Ravelli,

1682
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:41,709
you couldn't
put the maid
in your room, eh?

1683
01:29:41,793 --> 01:29:44,045
What makes you think
I couldn't?

1684
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:47,298
Well, there's gonna be
a lot of traffic in there.
I can see that.

1685
01:29:47,382 --> 01:29:50,593
Well, what do you say?
You ready to sign
the lease?

1686
01:29:51,428 --> 01:29:52,470
Well, it's a little
premature.

1687
01:29:52,554 --> 01:29:54,013
I'd like to discuss it
with my husband.

1688
01:29:54,097 --> 01:29:55,890
Could you come back
this evening
when he is home?

1689
01:29:55,974 --> 01:29:57,141
Hey, you married?

1690
01:29:57,309 --> 01:29:59,018
Why, I've got
a girl as big
as you are.

1691
01:29:59,102 --> 01:30:00,728
All right,
get me one.

1692
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:02,688
Don't get vulgar,
Ravelli.

1693
01:30:02,773 --> 01:30:04,774
Ravelli, how about
the painting?

1694
01:30:04,858 --> 01:30:06,484
We take care
of that, all right.

1695
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:07,735
Now, I tell you
what my idea is.

1696
01:30:07,819 --> 01:30:09,361
I think the kitchen
should be white.

1697
01:30:09,446 --> 01:30:11,322
Outside green,
inside cerise
with blue...

1698
01:30:11,406 --> 01:30:13,532
The painting, I say.
How about the painting,
Ravelli?

1699
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:15,451
All right,
what do you think I talk?
That's painting.

1700
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,620
The kitchen white,
outside green, inside cerise.

1701
01:30:17,704 --> 01:30:19,622
The painting.
The painting
that was stolen.

1702
01:30:19,706 --> 01:30:20,706
Stolen?

1703
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,500
Don't you remember
Mrs. Rittenhouse lost

1704
01:30:22,584 --> 01:30:25,169
a valuable Beaugard
painting worth $100,000?

1705
01:30:25,253 --> 01:30:27,254
Don't you remember that?

1706
01:30:27,506 --> 01:30:29,924
No, I'm a stranger
around here.
I no remember that.

1707
01:30:30,008 --> 01:30:32,718
What do you think I am,
one of the early settlers?

1708
01:30:32,803 --> 01:30:33,886
Ravelli,
don't you remember,

1709
01:30:33,970 --> 01:30:38,015
Mrs. Beaugard lost
a valuable Rittenhouse
painting worth $100,000?

1710
01:30:38,225 --> 01:30:39,558
Don't you remember that?

1711
01:30:39,643 --> 01:30:42,311
No, but I've seen you
someplace before.

1712
01:30:44,231 --> 01:30:45,272
Well, I don't know
where I was,

1713
01:30:45,357 --> 01:30:47,316
but I'll stay
out of there
in the future.

1714
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,944
Hey, Cap,
it come to me
like a flash!

1715
01:30:50,153 --> 01:30:52,488
This painting
wasn't stolen. Huh!

1716
01:30:52,697 --> 01:30:53,781
You know
what happened?

1717
01:30:53,865 --> 01:30:55,741
This painting, Cap,
is disappear.

1718
01:30:55,826 --> 01:30:57,451
Vanish.
Yes, it disappear.

1719
01:30:57,536 --> 01:30:59,870
And you know what
make it disappear?
You'll never guess, Cap.

1720
01:30:59,955 --> 01:31:02,081
What do you think
make this painting
disappear, eh?

1721
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:06,043
Moths! Moths eat it!
Left-handed moths.

1722
01:31:10,340 --> 01:31:13,425
Go away. Go away.
I'll be all right
in a minute.

1723
01:31:13,635 --> 01:31:15,636
Left-handed moths
ate the painting, eh?

1724
01:31:15,720 --> 01:31:17,263
That's my own solution.

1725
01:31:17,430 --> 01:31:19,140
I wish you were in it.

1726
01:31:19,224 --> 01:31:21,016
Left-handed moths
ate the painting.

1727
01:31:21,977 --> 01:31:24,687
You know, I'd buy you
a parachute if I thought
it wouldn't open.

1728
01:31:25,438 --> 01:31:26,772
Hey, I got
pair of shoes.

1729
01:31:29,693 --> 01:31:30,818
That's crazy.

1730
01:31:30,902 --> 01:31:32,945
Come on, let's get out
and get the reward.
We solved it.

1731
01:31:33,029 --> 01:31:35,156
You solved it!
The credit
is all yours.

1732
01:31:35,240 --> 01:31:37,032
The painting was eaten
by a left-handed moth.

1733
01:31:37,117 --> 01:31:38,742
Hey, I know, we did
a good day's work.

1734
01:31:38,869 --> 01:31:40,202
How do you feel?
Tired?
It's worth it.

1735
01:31:40,287 --> 01:31:42,413
Maybe you ought to lie down
for a couple of years, eh?
Well...

1736
01:31:42,497 --> 01:31:44,540
Why don't you just lie down
until rigor mortis sets in?

1737
01:31:44,624 --> 01:31:46,041
Yeah. That's nothing.
Come on, Ravelli.

1738
01:31:46,126 --> 01:31:47,835
I'll show you how
we get the painting.
Yeah.

1739
01:31:47,919 --> 01:31:50,796
We go to court
and we get out a writ
of habeas corpus.

1740
01:31:50,881 --> 01:31:52,882
You're gonna
get rid of what?

1741
01:31:52,966 --> 01:31:56,010
Oh, I should never
have started that way.
I can see that.

1742
01:31:56,094 --> 01:31:59,638
I say, we'll go to court
and we'll get a writ
of habeas corpus.

1743
01:31:59,723 --> 01:32:01,098
Yeah, scorpus,
scorpus.

1744
01:32:01,183 --> 01:32:02,975
Didn't you ever
see a habeas corpus?

1745
01:32:03,059 --> 01:32:04,977
No, but I see
Habeas Irish Rose.

1746
01:32:06,396 --> 01:32:07,938
Hey, it's okay.

1747
01:32:10,192 --> 01:32:11,650
Good morning.

1748
01:32:11,735 --> 01:32:13,569
Good morning.

1749
01:32:14,279 --> 01:32:15,529
Mr. Chandler,

1750
01:32:15,614 --> 01:32:17,615
why don't you go
down to the beach
with the others?

1751
01:32:17,699 --> 01:32:19,450
I'm sure
you'd feel better.

1752
01:32:19,534 --> 01:32:22,036
If I had my Beaugard,
I'm sure I'd feel better.

1753
01:32:22,287 --> 01:32:24,705
Oh, but we're doing
everything we can.

1754
01:32:24,789 --> 01:32:26,832
Mrs. Rittenhouse,
Mrs. Rittenhouse!
I have it.

1755
01:32:26,917 --> 01:32:27,917
The Beaugard!

1756
01:32:28,001 --> 01:32:29,919
Wonderful!
My Beaugard!

1757
01:32:30,253 --> 01:32:32,046
Wait, this is
not my Beaugard!

1758
01:32:32,130 --> 01:32:34,381
This is a rank imitation.
Where did you find it?

1759
01:32:34,466 --> 01:32:35,507
Why, in Mr. uh...

1760
01:32:35,592 --> 01:32:37,343
In Mr. Parker's
room, madam.

1761
01:32:37,427 --> 01:32:38,636
Parker!

1762
01:32:38,845 --> 01:32:40,012
One thing
is certain!

1763
01:32:40,096 --> 01:32:42,473
The man who made that,
stole the Beaugard!

1764
01:32:42,599 --> 01:32:45,726
Hives, find Mr. Parker
and ask him to come here.
Certainly, madam.

1765
01:32:45,810 --> 01:32:47,519
Wait a minute.
My men will
bring him in.

1766
01:32:47,604 --> 01:32:49,355
Go out and get
Mr. Parker.

1767
01:32:49,439 --> 01:32:50,564
Oh, what's
the matter
with this?

1768
01:32:50,649 --> 01:32:53,859
Well, look at here.
You've only to look
at it once to see what it is.

1769
01:32:53,944 --> 01:32:55,736
It is a rank nothing!

1770
01:33:18,635 --> 01:33:21,720
Mother, what's wrong?
I can come in without
being pulled in.

1771
01:33:21,805 --> 01:33:24,473
Mr. Parker, something
very mysterious
has occurred.

1772
01:33:24,557 --> 01:33:26,892
And I'm afraid,
you're the only one
who can explain.

1773
01:33:26,977 --> 01:33:28,644
I'd be only
too glad to
if I can.

1774
01:33:28,728 --> 01:33:29,770
Nothing mysterious
about it.

1775
01:33:29,854 --> 01:33:30,854
We found this
in your room.

1776
01:33:30,939 --> 01:33:32,815
Now, what have
you done with
the original Beaugard?

1777
01:33:32,899 --> 01:33:34,066
Come clean!

1778
01:33:34,150 --> 01:33:35,109
Come on,
out with it.

1779
01:33:35,193 --> 01:33:36,193
Really, I think
I would be wise...

1780
01:33:36,278 --> 01:33:37,778
Well, I have
nothing to say.

1781
01:33:37,862 --> 01:33:39,405
Except that I don't know
where the Beaugard is.

1782
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:41,407
Oh, how is it
we found this
in your room?

1783
01:33:41,491 --> 01:33:42,866
Come on!
You better come with me.

1784
01:33:42,951 --> 01:33:43,951
You can't take him!

1785
01:33:44,035 --> 01:33:45,286
Arabella!

1786
01:33:45,370 --> 01:33:46,829
Sing one song

1787
01:33:46,913 --> 01:33:50,666
For my old Kentucky home

1788
01:33:51,209 --> 01:33:53,502
For my old

1789
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:58,257
Kentucky home

1790
01:33:58,842 --> 01:34:02,761
Far away

1791
01:34:02,846 --> 01:34:07,433
So far away

1792
01:34:08,560 --> 01:34:11,061
This program is
coming to you from
the House of David.

1793
01:34:17,861 --> 01:34:19,611
He's either got
that suit on
upside down

1794
01:34:19,696 --> 01:34:21,780
or there is
no law of gravity.

1795
01:34:21,865 --> 01:34:23,741
Einstein or no one.
My tie!

1796
01:34:24,367 --> 01:34:26,410
Oh, Captain,
what shall I do?

1797
01:34:26,536 --> 01:34:27,828
They're going
to arrest John.

1798
01:34:27,871 --> 01:34:29,455
Who's going
to arrest John?
I am, Captain.

1799
01:34:29,539 --> 01:34:30,914
Oh, you are, eh?
Well, let me
tell you something.

1800
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,708
The first thing
they teach you
at Scotland Yard

1801
01:34:32,792 --> 01:34:34,043
is never to arrest
an innocent man.

1802
01:34:34,127 --> 01:34:35,294
But he's
not innocent.

1803
01:34:35,378 --> 01:34:36,879
I'll have
to arrest him
just the same.

1804
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:39,798
By all means
or nobody will
be safe here.

1805
01:34:39,883 --> 01:34:41,425
You can't
arrest him!

1806
01:34:41,509 --> 01:34:42,926
- I stole it!
- Arabella!

1807
01:34:43,011 --> 01:34:44,595
Don't listen to her,
Officer. I did it.

1808
01:34:44,763 --> 01:34:46,305
They're both lying.
I did it!

1809
01:34:46,389 --> 01:34:47,556
I did it with
my little hatchet.

1810
01:34:47,640 --> 01:34:49,099
Eh, he's crazy.
He's crazy.

1811
01:34:49,184 --> 01:34:50,559
I confess,
I did it.

1812
01:34:50,643 --> 01:34:52,186
Or maybe
nobody stole
the painting.

1813
01:34:52,270 --> 01:34:53,395
Maybe there was
no painting.

1814
01:34:53,480 --> 01:34:55,731
That's right, maybe
there was no painting.
I saw it.

1815
01:34:55,815 --> 01:34:56,940
Cut out
all the talk.

1816
01:34:57,025 --> 01:34:58,275
Who stole
the painting?

1817
01:34:58,360 --> 01:34:59,693
I did.

1818
01:34:59,778 --> 01:35:00,778
Good gracious!
What!

1819
01:35:00,904 --> 01:35:02,571
What in the...

1820
01:35:02,655 --> 01:35:03,655
What? You?

1821
01:35:03,740 --> 01:35:04,823
You took
the picture?

1822
01:35:04,908 --> 01:35:06,325
Where is it?

1823
01:35:06,743 --> 01:35:08,452
Oh, that's
a horse.

1824
01:35:10,914 --> 01:35:13,290
The Beaugard!
That is my Beaugard!

1825
01:35:13,458 --> 01:35:15,626
No, that isn't
your Beaugard.

1826
01:35:15,919 --> 01:35:16,919
Don't be ridiculous.

1827
01:35:17,003 --> 01:35:18,879
I paid $100,000
for this painting.

1828
01:35:18,963 --> 01:35:19,963
I know
what I bought.

1829
01:35:20,048 --> 01:35:22,174
Well, look at
the signature.

1830
01:35:22,592 --> 01:35:24,134
"John Parker."

1831
01:35:24,344 --> 01:35:26,178
Somebody changed it.

1832
01:35:32,268 --> 01:35:33,685
That is my Beaugard!

1833
01:35:33,770 --> 01:35:35,813
That is the Beaugard,
I tell you!

1834
01:35:35,897 --> 01:35:36,897
There it is!

1835
01:35:37,190 --> 01:35:38,607
Ah, but that one.

1836
01:35:38,691 --> 01:35:42,361
That has the color,
the depth, the soul
of the Beaugard!

1837
01:35:42,445 --> 01:35:44,822
Only a master could
have produced
a painting like that.

1838
01:35:44,906 --> 01:35:46,865
Oh, John.

1839
01:35:46,991 --> 01:35:49,451
You mean to tell me
that you painted that?
Yes, sir.

1840
01:35:49,536 --> 01:35:52,162
Why, young man,
you're a genius!
You're a genius!

1841
01:35:52,247 --> 01:35:55,416
I commission you
to paint a portrait
of me immediately!

1842
01:35:55,500 --> 01:35:57,042
Well, you better
wait until tomorrow.

1843
01:35:57,127 --> 01:35:58,544
I'm gonna be
busy all day.

1844
01:35:58,628 --> 01:36:00,212
Get it?

1845
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,882
You better
come with me,
young fellow!

1846
01:36:03,967 --> 01:36:05,384
Don't take him away,
Officer.

1847
01:36:05,468 --> 01:36:07,469
He returned
the paintings.

1848
01:36:08,805 --> 01:36:09,972
Pardon me,
my name is Spaulding.

1849
01:36:10,056 --> 01:36:11,348
I've always wanted
to meet you.

1850
01:36:11,433 --> 01:36:13,892
All right.
I'll let him go
this time.

1851
01:36:13,977 --> 01:36:15,602
But I want to give you
some advice.

1852
01:36:15,687 --> 01:36:18,439
You're running around
with the wrong
kind of people.

1853
01:36:18,523 --> 01:36:20,315
You wanna
be a crook?

1854
01:36:21,901 --> 01:36:23,277
Oh, why don't
you go home?

1855
01:36:23,361 --> 01:36:24,528
He's got no home.

1856
01:36:24,612 --> 01:36:27,197
Go home
for a few nights
and stay home.

1857
01:36:27,365 --> 01:36:29,616
Don't you know your poor,
old mother sits there...

1858
01:36:36,708 --> 01:36:39,084
...sits there
night after...

1859
01:36:39,169 --> 01:36:41,336
...night after night.

1860
01:36:41,963 --> 01:36:44,548
...waiting to hear
your steps
on the stairs.

1861
01:36:44,632 --> 01:36:46,258
He got no stairs.

1862
01:36:46,509 --> 01:36:49,386
And I can see a little
light burning in...

1863
01:36:49,512 --> 01:36:50,804
...burning
in the window.

1864
01:36:50,889 --> 01:36:53,724
No, you can't.
The gas company
turned it off.

1865
01:36:53,850 --> 01:36:57,144
What I'm telling you
is for your own good.

1866
01:36:58,146 --> 01:37:00,606
And if you listen
to me...

1867
01:37:00,690 --> 01:37:02,816
You can't go wrong.

1868
01:37:07,363 --> 01:37:09,198
This may
go on for years.

1869
01:37:09,282 --> 01:37:10,282
Now, there's
just one thing...

1870
01:37:15,121 --> 01:37:17,164
I can't understand
what's delaying
that coffee pot.

1871
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,375
Where's the cream?

1872
01:37:20,460 --> 01:37:23,462
Well, you certainly
surprised me!

1873
01:37:23,880 --> 01:37:25,631
Me, too.
I thought he had
more than that.

1874
01:37:25,715 --> 01:37:27,591
It's no use
giving you
any advice.

1875
01:37:27,800 --> 01:37:30,511
Captain,
this time I'm afraid
I'll have to take him.

1876
01:37:30,595 --> 01:37:32,804
Come on, here!
Come on! Come on!

1877
01:37:32,889 --> 01:37:34,973
Oh, what's he doing?

1878
01:37:37,268 --> 01:37:39,394
Oh, my dear, oh!

1879
01:37:39,812 --> 01:37:40,979
Hey, what's
the idea?

1880
01:37:41,064 --> 01:37:42,648
Jamison,
take a letter
to my lawyer!

1881
01:37:42,732 --> 01:37:44,233
No, no! Oh, no!

1882
01:37:44,317 --> 01:37:46,860
Oh, no, no!
Not... Oh.

1883
01:37:46,945 --> 01:37:49,738
Oh, to think
that I've got
to go so young.

1884
01:37:57,038 --> 01:37:58,497
Good. Come on, now.
Let's get out of here

1885
01:37:58,581 --> 01:37:59,831
before they all wake up.

1886
01:37:59,916 --> 01:38:02,876
Hurry up!
Come on, come on,
come on, come on.
