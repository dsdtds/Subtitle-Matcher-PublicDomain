1
00:02:05,126 --> 00:02:07,795
Hey, you all right down there?

2
00:02:19,849 --> 00:02:20,850
Stay where you are.

3
00:02:20,891 --> 00:02:21,701
Don't move.

4
00:02:21,725 --> 00:02:22,619
Keep calm.

5
00:02:22,643 --> 00:02:24,145
Don't get excited.

6
00:02:24,186 --> 00:02:26,147
I'll get you out of
there right away.

7
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:27,188
Keep calm.

8
00:02:29,108 --> 00:02:30,609
Now wait a minute.

9
00:02:32,945 --> 00:02:34,446
Come on I'll help.

10
00:02:37,927 --> 00:02:38,927
There you are.

11
00:02:38,951 --> 00:02:40,286
What did we hit?

12
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,370
Nothing.

13
00:02:41,412 --> 00:02:43,164
We had a blowout.

14
00:02:43,205 --> 00:02:44,365
I don't understand it either,

15
00:02:44,389 --> 00:02:47,501
that was a brand
new tire this morning.

16
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:50,129
What's the matter,
you sure you're all right?

17
00:02:50,171 --> 00:02:52,006
I'm a little shaky I guess.

18
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:54,633
Come we can sit down over here.

19
00:02:56,302 --> 00:02:58,220
What am I? An orphan?

20
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,056
Come on.

21
00:03:03,111 --> 00:03:04,911
Any man that drives
as fast as you oughta be

22
00:03:04,935 --> 00:03:06,020
run out of this country.

23
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,939
You tell me all
about it sometime.

24
00:03:08,981 --> 00:03:10,774
Thanks for the lift buddy.

25
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,611
Say, I'm awfully
sorry about all this.

26
00:03:13,652 --> 00:03:15,279
You're sorry? How about us?

27
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:16,256
We can't stay here all night.

28
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,215
Well, you won't have to.

29
00:03:17,239 --> 00:03:19,159
I said I'd get you to
Carrington Hall and I will.

30
00:03:19,183 --> 00:03:19,593
How?

31
00:03:19,617 --> 00:03:20,594
Gonna fly us there on a broom?

32
00:03:20,618 --> 00:03:21,428
I'll get help.

33
00:03:21,452 --> 00:03:23,495
We passed a garage
about two miles back.

34
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:25,537
Now you take it easy and
don't worry about a thing.

35
00:03:25,561 --> 00:03:27,124
I'll be back in a
flash with a tow car.

36
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,210
Why it's as simple
as falling off a log.

37
00:03:30,085 --> 00:03:31,670
Huh! Comfortable?

38
00:03:34,131 --> 00:03:35,799
Don't go 'way now.

39
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,767
Must have been
his wife with him.

40
00:04:03,244 --> 00:04:05,329
Uh oh! Danger ahead.

41
00:04:05,371 --> 00:04:06,371
Two of 'em!

42
00:04:08,768 --> 00:04:09,768
Oh thanks!

43
00:04:09,792 --> 00:04:11,472
It was awfully sweet
of you to stop for us.

44
00:04:11,496 --> 00:04:11,978
But I, I...

45
00:04:12,002 --> 00:04:13,282
Annie you get in the backseat.

46
00:04:13,306 --> 00:04:14,338
Can you manage the bags?

47
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,190
Yes, I think so.

48
00:04:15,214 --> 00:04:17,132
Here are mine, there.

49
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:20,261
Now, mind if I sit on your lap?

50
00:04:20,302 --> 00:04:21,742
Oh well really my
dear young lady.

51
00:04:21,783 --> 00:04:23,463
We're awfully sorry
to inconvenience you,

52
00:04:23,487 --> 00:04:24,556
but we had a blowout.

53
00:04:24,598 --> 00:04:26,517
Ahh this is comfortable.

54
00:04:26,558 --> 00:04:27,758
Well, what are we waiting for?

55
00:04:27,782 --> 00:04:29,478
Oh very well Eddie, drive on.

56
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,520
Yes sir.

57
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:35,401
Would you mind telling me
where you ladies are taking me?

58
00:04:35,442 --> 00:04:36,610
To the Carrington Estate.

59
00:04:36,652 --> 00:04:37,587
Uh oh!

60
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:39,989
Is there anything wrong
with the Carrington place?

61
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:41,991
Yes ma'am, if there
wasn't anybody living there,

62
00:04:42,032 --> 00:04:44,034
it'd be a haunted house.

63
00:04:49,206 --> 00:04:51,333
My my Cosmo's late.

64
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,752
He's usually home by now.

65
00:04:53,794 --> 00:04:55,963
Oo, my it's chilly, isn't it?

66
00:04:56,005 --> 00:04:57,840
Emily remind me to
send this coat back.

67
00:04:57,881 --> 00:04:59,717
Doesn't keep me warm at all.

68
00:04:59,758 --> 00:05:02,052
Mrs. Topper, you
haven't got it on.

69
00:05:02,094 --> 00:05:03,762
Oh how silly of me.

70
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,432
My strange how it's
usually cold in the winter

71
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:08,600
and warm in summer, isn't it?

72
00:05:08,642 --> 00:05:10,394
Oh there's Cosmo now!

73
00:05:14,064 --> 00:05:16,191
Oh look, someone's waving to us.

74
00:05:16,233 --> 00:05:17,526
It's a lady.

75
00:05:17,568 --> 00:05:21,405
It's worse than that
boss, it's Mrs. Topper.

76
00:05:23,240 --> 00:05:27,453
Emily, look, he's got
a carload of women.

77
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:31,540
And one of them, one of
them's sitting on his lap!

78
00:05:31,582 --> 00:05:32,582
Emily!

79
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:56,482
Well, here it is.

80
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:58,692
Are you sure this is
the Carrington place?

81
00:05:58,734 --> 00:06:00,054
Yeah, that's what they call it.

82
00:06:00,078 --> 00:06:02,915
Cheerful little eyeful isn't it?

83
00:06:05,991 --> 00:06:07,785
Thanks for the lift Mr. Topper.

84
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:08,762
Don't mention it.

85
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:09,986
Hurry up with those bags Eddie

86
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:13,931
Yes sir, I ain't wasting
no time around here.

87
00:06:15,209 --> 00:06:17,169
I'd like to invite you in, but,

88
00:06:17,211 --> 00:06:19,546
Oh, no thanks, very much,
we've got to be getting home.

89
00:06:19,588 --> 00:06:20,923
We sure do!

90
00:06:20,964 --> 00:06:21,964
Goodbye.

91
00:06:23,967 --> 00:06:24,967
Goodbye.

92
00:06:28,222 --> 00:06:29,348
Bye!

93
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,058
Good evening.

94
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,602
Why don't you knock
before you come out?

95
00:06:33,644 --> 00:06:35,771
I'm the butler, Miss Carrington.

96
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:37,106
Oh, I'm not Miss Carrington.

97
00:06:37,147 --> 00:06:38,148
There she is.

98
00:06:38,190 --> 00:06:39,441
How do you do?

99
00:06:39,483 --> 00:06:41,735
Won't you please step in?

100
00:07:11,158 --> 00:07:12,158
Miss Carrington?

101
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:12,992
Yes.

102
00:07:13,016 --> 00:07:14,852
I'm Lillian, the house keeper.

103
00:07:14,893 --> 00:07:16,228
Well, how do you do?

104
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:17,855
This is my friend Miss Richards.

105
00:07:17,896 --> 00:07:18,832
Howdy.

106
00:07:18,856 --> 00:07:20,107
Your father's waiting Miss.

107
00:07:20,149 --> 00:07:21,316
Thank you.

108
00:07:21,358 --> 00:07:23,777
Would you mind waiting here?

109
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,154
This way please.

110
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,579
One moment please.

111
00:07:37,685 --> 00:07:38,685
Miss Carrington?

112
00:07:38,709 --> 00:07:41,879
This is Dr. Jeris,
your father's physician.

113
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,672
How do you do Dr. Jeris?

114
00:07:43,714 --> 00:07:45,594
I'd like a few words
with you Miss Carrington,

115
00:07:45,618 --> 00:07:47,634
before you see your father.

116
00:07:47,676 --> 00:07:48,677
Of course.

117
00:07:49,887 --> 00:07:52,181
I'll be as brief as possible.

118
00:07:52,222 --> 00:07:55,142
Your father's far from being
a well man Miss Carrington.

119
00:07:55,184 --> 00:07:56,852
Yes, I know.

120
00:07:56,894 --> 00:07:58,812
Seeing you for the first
time may be something

121
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:00,355
of a shock to him.

122
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,650
I think I understand doctor.

123
00:08:03,692 --> 00:08:05,372
He's been looking
forward to your arrival

124
00:08:05,396 --> 00:08:07,147
with great eagerness.

125
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:10,540
I hope there'll never
be any occasion for you

126
00:08:10,564 --> 00:08:13,150
to be separated from him again.

127
00:08:14,286 --> 00:08:15,954
Come with me please.

128
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:42,356
Mr. Carrington, Mr. Carrington?

129
00:08:45,776 --> 00:08:46,776
Mm?

130
00:08:47,736 --> 00:08:50,739
This is your daughter.

131
00:08:57,496 --> 00:08:58,496
Oh!

132
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:09,840
Ann.

133
00:09:12,803 --> 00:09:16,265
I, I don't know quite
what to do or say.

134
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:20,393
Nor do I.

135
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:25,732
Except to tell you,
Ann, you're beautiful.

136
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:30,988
You're the image of your
mother when she was young.

137
00:09:32,573 --> 00:09:34,575
Perhaps you better sit down?

138
00:09:34,616 --> 00:09:35,616
Yes.

139
00:09:39,538 --> 00:09:43,584
I know you must
think it very strange,

140
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:47,004
seeing your own
father for the first time

141
00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:50,090
on the eve of
your 21st birthday.

142
00:09:50,132 --> 00:09:53,677
Well, naturally I wondered
why you never sent for me.

143
00:09:53,719 --> 00:09:56,054
Your mother loved
the Far East, Ann.

144
00:09:56,096 --> 00:09:57,806
Her last wish was
that you be brought up

145
00:09:57,848 --> 00:10:00,392
in the land she loved so well.

146
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:02,227
I wanted to send
for you many times,

147
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:05,022
but I had to respect
your mother's wishes.

148
00:10:05,063 --> 00:10:06,743
And of course my own
health wouldn't permit

149
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,066
me to visit you.

150
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:09,943
I understand father.

151
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:12,738
I hope you had a pleasant trip.

152
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:15,574
Yes we, we had a wonderful trip.

153
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:16,426
We?

154
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,160
Oh, I brought a
friend along with me.

155
00:10:18,201 --> 00:10:20,621
An American girl
named Gail Richards.

156
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,415
Her father's the head of an
exporting company in Shanghai.

157
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:24,875
Richards you say?

158
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:25,916
Mmhmm.

159
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:30,631
Oh, I, I hope you don't
mind my bringing her?

160
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:32,799
Of course not.

161
00:10:32,841 --> 00:10:35,052
Besides the house
belongs to you now.

162
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:37,346
No father, to us.

163
00:10:37,387 --> 00:10:40,682
No my dear, by the
terms of your mother's will.

164
00:10:40,724 --> 00:10:43,644
Everything belongs
to you after tomorrow.

165
00:10:43,685 --> 00:10:47,856
What else do you do around
here beside wind clocks?

166
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:50,651
Been here long?

167
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,653
- 20 years.
- 20 years!

168
00:10:52,694 --> 00:10:55,280
Looks like it might turn
out to be a steady job, huh?

169
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:01,703
Your mother wanted
you to have these Ann.

170
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:05,707
They're exactly as she
wore them 20 years ago.

171
00:11:05,749 --> 00:11:06,559
Oh Dad!

172
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:09,294
They're, they're beautiful!

173
00:11:09,336 --> 00:11:11,171
They'll look every bit
as beautiful upon you

174
00:11:11,213 --> 00:11:13,382
as they did upon your mother.

175
00:11:13,423 --> 00:11:17,761
Dad, I, I never did know
just how mother died.

176
00:11:17,803 --> 00:11:20,138
Some sort of an
accident, wasn't it?

177
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:21,848
Yes dear.

178
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:23,308
A mine cave in.

179
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:28,855
I met your mother in Singapore.

180
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:32,067
After you were born we
decided to move to Sumatra

181
00:11:32,109 --> 00:11:34,861
where I had an interest
in a tungsten mine.

182
00:11:34,903 --> 00:11:38,407
My partner was a man
named Walter Harberg.

183
00:11:39,533 --> 00:11:42,244
One day he was showing
your mother through the mine

184
00:11:42,285 --> 00:11:45,455
when suddenly there
was an earthquake.

185
00:11:46,433 --> 00:11:47,433
The tunnel collapsed.

186
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:50,627
You've talked
enough Mr. Carrington.

187
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:54,589
I'm sorry to interrupt, but
we mustn't tire your father.

188
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:56,967
Oh, of course not.

189
00:11:57,008 --> 00:11:58,448
I hope you'll like
your room dear.

190
00:11:58,472 --> 00:11:59,720
Oh I'm sure I will.

191
00:11:59,761 --> 00:12:03,098
Lillian will show
you where it is.

192
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,142
I'm supposed to
conserve my strength.

193
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:06,601
It's quite all right, father.

194
00:12:06,643 --> 00:12:08,103
Good night darling.

195
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,438
I'll see you in the morning.

196
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:10,897
Good night.

197
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:12,107
Good night Dr. Jeris.

198
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:14,568
Good night Miss Carrington.

199
00:12:17,738 --> 00:12:19,197
Where's Miss Richards?

200
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,657
Here I am, pal!

201
00:12:25,036 --> 00:12:26,538
Ann! Ann look out!

202
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,580
Look out!

203
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,375
Ann!

204
00:12:32,627 --> 00:12:33,962
Ann!

205
00:12:34,004 --> 00:12:35,338
Ann!

206
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:37,048
Ann are you hurt?

207
00:12:37,090 --> 00:12:39,009
Oh, no I'm all right.

208
00:12:40,177 --> 00:12:42,971
Ann, what on earth happened?

209
00:12:43,013 --> 00:12:43,906
Well I don't know.

210
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,390
That was rather a close call.

211
00:12:45,432 --> 00:12:46,242
Close?

212
00:12:46,266 --> 00:12:48,346
Six more inches and we'd
all be singing Annie doesn't

213
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:49,436
live here anymore.

214
00:12:49,478 --> 00:12:51,897
- How could something happen?
- Please Mr. Carrington.

215
00:12:51,938 --> 00:12:54,274
You mustn't excite yourself.

216
00:12:55,567 --> 00:12:57,247
I think you'd better
show the young ladies

217
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:58,278
to their rooms.

218
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,655
Yeah, pick us a couple
without chandeliers, would you?

219
00:13:00,697 --> 00:13:02,199
This way please.

220
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,785
Thank you old boy.

221
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:24,553
Look!

222
00:13:25,347 --> 00:13:28,016
The Chinese room will
be yours Miss Richards.

223
00:13:28,058 --> 00:13:29,726
Oh, you're a doll.

224
00:13:32,604 --> 00:13:34,147
Well this is just dandy.

225
00:13:34,189 --> 00:13:36,817
I travel 7000 miles to
get away from Chinamen

226
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:40,946
and here I am with
everything but a bowl of rice.

227
00:13:42,823 --> 00:13:44,533
What's that sound?

228
00:13:44,574 --> 00:13:47,494
It's the waves, angry waves.

229
00:13:47,536 --> 00:13:50,121
Day after day,
night after night.

230
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:53,542
They beat with savage fury
against the black rocks below.

231
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:57,504
For 20 years they've
been calling, calling, calling

232
00:13:57,546 --> 00:14:00,257
to someone who never answers.

233
00:14:00,298 --> 00:14:02,759
Just like the pot
of gold program.

234
00:14:02,801 --> 00:14:04,052
Will that be all Miss?

235
00:14:04,094 --> 00:14:05,178
No, I'm starved.

236
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,700
You forgot we didn't
have any dinner.

237
00:14:06,724 --> 00:14:08,348
Rama will bring you a tray.

238
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,517
Oh any little thing'll do,
lobster salad and beer,

239
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,410
but nothing heavy.

240
00:14:11,434 --> 00:14:12,936
Anything for you
Miss Carrington?

241
00:14:12,978 --> 00:14:14,729
No thank you Rama.

242
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,314
I'm going to bed Gail.

243
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,399
I'm all in.

244
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,526
I'm kinda baggy myself.

245
00:14:20,902 --> 00:14:22,502
- Good night Miss Richards.
- Good night.

246
00:14:22,526 --> 00:14:23,822
I hope you rest in peace.

247
00:14:23,864 --> 00:14:25,282
Thank you.

248
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:26,992
Isn't that what they
right on tombstones?

249
00:14:27,033 --> 00:14:29,035
Oh don't be silly.

250
00:14:29,077 --> 00:14:30,370
Go on to bed.

251
00:14:30,412 --> 00:14:31,997
Good night darling.

252
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:42,966
Your father had this room
done especially for you.

253
00:14:43,008 --> 00:14:44,134
It's lovely.

254
00:14:44,175 --> 00:14:46,887
Very sorry Miss,
but we have no beer.

255
00:14:46,928 --> 00:14:48,179
I brought you some wine.

256
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:48,990
Wine?

257
00:14:49,014 --> 00:14:50,140
Why that's champagne!

258
00:14:50,181 --> 00:14:50,992
Yes Miss.

259
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,726
Oh, put it down buddy!

260
00:14:52,767 --> 00:14:54,167
Will there be
anything else Miss?

261
00:14:54,191 --> 00:14:55,979
No, that's all thank you.

262
00:14:56,021 --> 00:14:57,021
Champagne!

263
00:14:58,189 --> 00:14:59,190
Why hide it?

264
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,290
Ann?

265
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,267
Yes?

266
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:17,101
Is that you?

267
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,877
Yes, it's me.

268
00:15:18,919 --> 00:15:21,338
Well open up and let me in.

269
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:41,232
Gee, where's the glass
slipper that goes with it?

270
00:15:41,274 --> 00:15:42,442
It is nice, isn't it?

271
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:43,294
Oh, nice?

272
00:15:43,318 --> 00:15:47,489
It's heaven compared to that
Chinese torture chamber I'm in.

273
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:49,783
Gee what a layout!

274
00:15:49,824 --> 00:15:53,495
Oh, this is for me.

275
00:15:53,536 --> 00:15:57,666
I've always wanted to sleep in
one of these covered wagons.

276
00:15:57,707 --> 00:15:59,668
It's almost too
nice to sleep in.

277
00:15:59,709 --> 00:16:01,749
Say what do you have to
do to get a bed like this?

278
00:16:01,773 --> 00:16:04,172
Rub a magic lamp or something?

279
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:06,174
You really like this
room, don't you?

280
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,468
Ah, this is right up my alley.

281
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:12,681
Oh, to catch measles and
have to stay in a bed like this.

282
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,770
Hey, where ya going?

283
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:19,980
I'm going to bed.

284
00:16:20,021 --> 00:16:22,273
For tonight darling,
this room is yours.

285
00:16:22,315 --> 00:16:23,984
Oh no you don't.

286
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:26,653
I wouldn't dream of letting
you do anything like that.

287
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:27,779
But it's a deal!

288
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,322
Anything to keep out of China.

289
00:16:29,364 --> 00:16:30,699
Good night Cinderella.

290
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,550
Good night pal.

291
00:16:31,574 --> 00:16:33,410
And I do mean pal.

292
00:16:33,451 --> 00:16:36,037
Say, lock your door in
case lady Frankenstein

293
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,664
walks in her sleep.

294
00:16:44,045 --> 00:16:45,880
Come in.

295
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:50,510
Did you wish anything doctor?

296
00:16:50,552 --> 00:16:52,929
Are the young
ladies comfortable?

297
00:16:52,971 --> 00:16:54,139
Quite.

298
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:56,182
That will be all then.

299
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,318
I don't mind if I do.

300
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:19,706
Ahh, China was never like this.

301
00:21:34,752 --> 00:21:36,192
That kind of
behavior is all right

302
00:21:36,216 --> 00:21:37,255
for a school boy, but,

303
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:40,049
Clara I've told repeatedly
and incessantly,

304
00:21:40,091 --> 00:21:42,051
when I could get a
word in edgewise,

305
00:21:42,093 --> 00:21:44,679
that the whole thing
was no fault of mine.

306
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,639
I think it's ridiculous
for a man of your age

307
00:21:46,681 --> 00:21:48,141
to pursue young girls.

308
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:49,851
What will the neighbors think?

309
00:21:49,892 --> 00:21:53,396
I didn't pursue them Clara,
they forced themselves on me.

310
00:21:53,438 --> 00:21:54,564
Don't be absurd.

311
00:21:54,605 --> 00:21:57,025
Imagine girls, pretty
girls, forcing themselves

312
00:21:57,066 --> 00:21:59,068
on a paunchy middle aged man.

313
00:21:59,110 --> 00:22:00,390
Why I don't think I'm paunchy.

314
00:22:00,414 --> 00:22:02,447
Don't try to change the subject.

315
00:22:02,488 --> 00:22:05,408
At least you might have
waved to me when you went by!

316
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:06,701
I've explained that darling.

317
00:22:06,743 --> 00:22:09,996
I couldn't, that girl
was sitting on my lap.

318
00:22:10,038 --> 00:22:11,414
I know she was!

319
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:15,501
I warn you Cosmo, if ever
you do a think like this again,

320
00:22:15,543 --> 00:22:18,046
I'm going back to Mamma.

321
00:22:18,087 --> 00:22:19,647
Clara, of course I
don't intend to do

322
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:21,341
a thing like that again.

323
00:22:21,382 --> 00:22:25,303
Besides, I couldn't very
well sit on her lap, could I?

324
00:22:25,345 --> 00:22:26,155
Cosmo,

325
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,973
this is hardly
the time for jokes.

326
00:22:31,476 --> 00:22:33,269
That's peculiar.

327
00:22:33,311 --> 00:22:34,937
I don't think it's so peculiar.

328
00:22:34,979 --> 00:22:37,023
After all we've been
married for 20 years.

329
00:22:37,065 --> 00:22:38,825
And I have a perfect
right to be treated like

330
00:22:38,849 --> 00:22:42,028
a wife who, who has
been married for 20 years.

331
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:43,112
That's odd.

332
00:22:43,154 --> 00:22:44,822
It's not odd at all!

333
00:22:44,864 --> 00:22:47,033
Cosmo, do you realize
what you're saying?

334
00:22:47,075 --> 00:22:49,369
Hm? I beg your
pardon dear, what?

335
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:51,263
Well if that's all the attention
you're going to give me

336
00:22:51,287 --> 00:22:52,455
I may as well go to bed.

337
00:22:52,497 --> 00:22:53,497
Good night.

338
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,463
Well, I might be
a little over weight,

339
00:23:00,505 --> 00:23:03,174
but I'm certainly not paunchy.

340
00:23:03,216 --> 00:23:05,968
In fact, I'm in pretty good
shape for the shape I'm in.

341
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:09,472
After all, I'm a banker,
not a glamor-boy.

342
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:42,713
Get your cold feet off my back!

343
00:23:44,132 --> 00:23:47,218
You don't need all
the covers do you?

344
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:55,059
Here I am, Toppy.

345
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:55,911
Remember me?

346
00:23:55,935 --> 00:23:57,228
The girl that sat on your lap?

347
00:23:57,270 --> 00:23:59,313
Oh this is terrible.

348
00:23:59,355 --> 00:24:00,982
What's terrible?

349
00:24:01,023 --> 00:24:03,568
You're a ghost, you're dead.

350
00:24:03,609 --> 00:24:04,694
No kiddin'!

351
00:24:04,735 --> 00:24:06,015
You've got to get out of here.

352
00:24:06,057 --> 00:24:08,184
I've had enough trouble
with your kind of people.

353
00:24:08,226 --> 00:24:10,116
Well, it's strange
I should be dead.

354
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:11,951
I was young and
healthy and I felt swell

355
00:24:11,993 --> 00:24:12,970
when I went to bed.

356
00:24:12,994 --> 00:24:14,287
So why did I die?

357
00:24:14,328 --> 00:24:15,431
I don't know, but
you can't stay here.

358
00:24:15,455 --> 00:24:17,290
You've got to go back
to the Carrington house.

359
00:24:17,331 --> 00:24:18,142
Cosmo!

360
00:24:18,166 --> 00:24:20,376
- There, you see?
- Cosmo!

361
00:24:20,418 --> 00:24:22,086
Quick, do something, vanish.

362
00:24:22,128 --> 00:24:24,964
Well all right Toppy, here I go.

363
00:24:26,883 --> 00:24:28,176
Oh it's you dear.

364
00:24:28,217 --> 00:24:30,386
Cosmo who on earth
were you talking to?

365
00:24:30,428 --> 00:24:31,596
Nobody dear.

366
00:24:32,638 --> 00:24:35,892
Nobody, I was just talking
in my sleep you know.

367
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,226
Talking in your sleep?

368
00:24:37,268 --> 00:24:39,187
But that's such a waste of time.

369
00:24:39,228 --> 00:24:40,396
Besides nobody can hear you.

370
00:24:40,438 --> 00:24:43,399
Oh, well I'm not
so sure about that.

371
00:24:43,441 --> 00:24:46,110
Cosmo, I, I'm sorry
I was so mean.

372
00:24:46,152 --> 00:24:47,832
I know you'd tell me
if there was anything

373
00:24:47,856 --> 00:24:48,988
between you and that girl.

374
00:24:49,030 --> 00:24:51,157
Let's forget all about her.

375
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:53,701
I'd like to dear, but
under the circumstances,

376
00:24:53,743 --> 00:24:54,744
I'm afraid I can't.

377
00:24:54,785 --> 00:24:57,025
Oh well of course, if that's
the way you feel about it.

378
00:24:57,049 --> 00:25:00,719
I'll talk to you in the
morning, when you're sober.

379
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:06,464
Ow!

380
00:25:08,257 --> 00:25:09,777
Why don't you look
where you're going?

381
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:11,139
Why don't you be where you are?

382
00:25:11,163 --> 00:25:12,887
Now see what you've done.

383
00:25:12,929 --> 00:25:14,849
That's nothing compared
to what I'm going to do

384
00:25:14,891 --> 00:25:16,184
if you don't come with me.

385
00:25:16,226 --> 00:25:17,642
Come with you? Where?

386
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:18,976
Back to the Carrington house.

387
00:25:19,018 --> 00:25:21,354
I'm curious to know
what happened to me.

388
00:25:21,395 --> 00:25:22,480
Go ahead!

389
00:25:22,522 --> 00:25:25,650
Oh no, no, I couldn't
go alone, I'm afraid.

390
00:25:25,691 --> 00:25:27,652
I don't like that
house, it's spooky.

391
00:25:27,693 --> 00:25:29,320
I won't go.

392
00:25:29,362 --> 00:25:31,948
All right, if that's the
way you feel about it.

393
00:25:31,989 --> 00:25:33,032
Get out of my bed.

394
00:25:33,074 --> 00:25:35,034
I won't, not unless
you come with me.

395
00:25:35,076 --> 00:25:36,996
You get out of my bed
or I'll tell Mrs. Topper.

396
00:25:37,038 --> 00:25:37,848
What'll you tell her?

397
00:25:37,872 --> 00:25:40,414
I'll tell her you're in my bed.

398
00:25:40,456 --> 00:25:43,668
I, oh no, I can't
very well tell her that.

399
00:25:43,709 --> 00:25:44,520
Not very well.

400
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:45,878
But I can.

401
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,855
Oh but you wouldn't do that.

402
00:25:46,879 --> 00:25:48,589
Mrs. Topper wouldn't understand.

403
00:25:48,631 --> 00:25:50,216
Are you coming with me or not?

404
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:51,068
I can't.

405
00:25:51,092 --> 00:25:53,594
All right then, I'll give you
three to make up your mind

406
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:54,845
and then I'll scream.

407
00:25:54,887 --> 00:25:55,887
- Oh.
- One, two,

408
00:25:56,764 --> 00:25:59,141
No, please, please don't.

409
00:25:59,183 --> 00:26:01,018
All right you win.

410
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,270
What do you want me to do now?

411
00:26:02,311 --> 00:26:04,031
Call your chauffeur
and tell him to take us

412
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:06,057
to the Carrington house.

413
00:26:16,742 --> 00:26:17,742
Hello?

414
00:26:18,828 --> 00:26:19,828
Yes boss.

415
00:26:22,707 --> 00:26:25,585
But it ain't daylight yet.

416
00:26:25,626 --> 00:26:27,461
Oh, you know that huh?

417
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:31,048
Yes sir, right away.

418
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,704
Well what are you gaping at?

419
00:27:01,746 --> 00:27:02,913
Wish I knew.

420
00:27:05,458 --> 00:27:08,419
Well, come on, get going.

421
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:09,461
Yes, sir.

422
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,058
Where to, Mr. Topper?

423
00:27:22,099 --> 00:27:24,101
The Carrington place.

424
00:27:24,143 --> 00:27:26,604
Pardon me boss, but
could I sorta inquire

425
00:27:26,646 --> 00:27:29,815
what we're going to
the Carrington place for?

426
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,234
To look for a body.

427
00:27:32,276 --> 00:27:33,736
Better look for one for me too,

428
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,864
'cause the one I'm
using now is numb.

429
00:27:47,667 --> 00:27:49,460
Come on Eddie,
you want to help huh?

430
00:27:49,502 --> 00:27:50,586
With what boss?

431
00:27:50,628 --> 00:27:51,480
With the body.

432
00:27:51,504 --> 00:27:52,505
The body...

433
00:27:54,674 --> 00:27:57,677
Okay, I'll go with ya, but
kinda keep to one side,

434
00:27:57,718 --> 00:28:02,515
'cause I gotta feeling some
running's gonna be done.

435
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:05,017
Toppy, that's the
bedroom I was in,

436
00:28:05,059 --> 00:28:06,185
the one with the balcony.

437
00:28:06,227 --> 00:28:07,853
How are we gonna get in?

438
00:28:07,895 --> 00:28:10,231
Through the window.

439
00:28:26,288 --> 00:28:27,288
Welp.

440
00:29:08,247 --> 00:29:10,750
Pardon me boss, but could I
get confidential for a moment?

441
00:29:10,791 --> 00:29:11,876
What is it?

442
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:15,463
Do I look as pale as I feel?

443
00:29:15,504 --> 00:29:17,298
What's the matter with you?

444
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:18,966
I don't know but
there's somebody here

445
00:29:19,008 --> 00:29:20,760
I can't account for.

446
00:29:20,801 --> 00:29:22,386
Come on, come on.

447
00:29:26,265 --> 00:29:28,768
Gimme your arm Toppy.

448
00:29:35,524 --> 00:29:38,360
Uh oh, them ain't rabbit tracks!

449
00:29:46,786 --> 00:29:48,078
Toppy, here's a window.

450
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,371
Let's see if we can get in.

451
00:29:49,413 --> 00:29:51,293
We can't do that, we'll
wake up the household.

452
00:29:51,317 --> 00:29:52,500
Don't argue.

453
00:29:52,541 --> 00:29:53,918
Here, I'll give you a boost.

454
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:55,377
Put your foot up.

455
00:29:58,232 --> 00:29:59,232
Ready?

456
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:00,066
Yes.

457
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,300
Uppsy-daisy.

458
00:30:01,342 --> 00:30:05,930
You oughta go on a diet.

459
00:30:05,971 --> 00:30:07,181
Try the window.

460
00:30:14,104 --> 00:30:16,065
Now give me a hand.

461
00:30:16,106 --> 00:30:17,000
Where are you?

462
00:30:17,024 --> 00:30:18,692
Right here.

463
00:30:34,977 --> 00:30:35,977
Is this the room?

464
00:30:36,001 --> 00:30:37,001
Yes.

465
00:30:44,510 --> 00:30:45,803
Where were you?

466
00:30:45,845 --> 00:30:49,014
Well, let me see, oh yes!

467
00:30:49,056 --> 00:30:51,892
I was sleeping at that bed.

468
00:30:51,934 --> 00:30:54,895
And then it seems I got
up to close a window.

469
00:30:54,937 --> 00:30:56,230
There's the window.

470
00:30:56,272 --> 00:30:58,566
And then I started
back to bed and,

471
00:30:58,607 --> 00:31:00,359
and that's all I remember.

472
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,944
Oh my gosh there I am!

473
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:04,154
Look! Right by the window!

474
00:31:11,078 --> 00:31:13,497
This is positively horrible!

475
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,082
You've been stabbed.

476
00:31:15,124 --> 00:31:16,124
Stabbed?

477
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,713
This is no time for champagne.

478
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,091
Oh but Toppy, it isn't every
day a girl gets murdered.

479
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:25,384
Look at me! Oh!

480
00:31:26,510 --> 00:31:28,679
Oh, please, please, please!

481
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:30,890
This is serious, we've
got to call the police.

482
00:31:30,931 --> 00:31:33,058
Yes, I wanna find
out who did this to me.

483
00:31:33,100 --> 00:31:33,910
Where's the telephone?

484
00:31:33,934 --> 00:31:36,020
- Downstairs.
- All right.

485
00:31:49,283 --> 00:31:51,452
Hello, operator, operator?

486
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,123
Operator?

487
00:31:56,165 --> 00:31:56,975
This thing's dead.

488
00:31:56,999 --> 00:31:58,792
Mmm epidemic.

489
00:31:58,834 --> 00:31:59,644
Where are you?

490
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:02,004
Here I am sweetie.

491
00:32:02,046 --> 00:32:03,672
Can't seem to get anybody.

492
00:32:03,714 --> 00:32:05,507
Maybe the wires have been cut.

493
00:32:05,549 --> 00:32:06,800
I'll trace 'em.

494
00:32:09,094 --> 00:32:10,846
Operator, operator.

495
00:32:13,474 --> 00:32:15,309
Put down that phone.

496
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,235
Stay where you are.

497
00:32:29,323 --> 00:32:31,241
Your phone's out of order.

498
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:32,260
Who are you?

499
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:33,577
Who? Me?

500
00:32:33,619 --> 00:32:35,746
I'm Cosmo Topper.

501
00:32:35,788 --> 00:32:38,123
I'm your next door neighbor.

502
00:32:40,167 --> 00:32:43,087
Nice place you've got here.

503
00:32:43,128 --> 00:32:44,128
Very nice.

504
00:32:45,798 --> 00:32:48,300
I just dropped in
to use the phone.

505
00:32:48,342 --> 00:32:50,844
At 12:30 in the morning?

506
00:32:50,886 --> 00:32:52,596
Is it really as late as that?

507
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,848
Well, I must be going.

508
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:55,891
No, mustn't.

509
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:58,435
Who were you calling?

510
00:32:58,477 --> 00:33:00,145
The police.

511
00:33:00,187 --> 00:33:02,439
There's been a murder here.

512
00:33:09,029 --> 00:33:11,073
Don't look at me like that,

513
00:33:11,115 --> 00:33:12,491
I didn't kill the girl.

514
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:14,013
What on earth are
you people doing?

515
00:33:14,037 --> 00:33:15,786
I found this man
prowling about the house.

516
00:33:15,828 --> 00:33:18,163
But this gentleman says
there's been a murder.

517
00:33:18,205 --> 00:33:19,581
What are you talking about?

518
00:33:19,623 --> 00:33:21,623
If you don't believe me,
go and see for yourself.

519
00:33:21,647 --> 00:33:24,169
It's in that big room
at the top of the stairs.

520
00:33:24,211 --> 00:33:27,047
Why that's Ann's room!

521
00:33:27,089 --> 00:33:28,089
Come on.

522
00:33:29,717 --> 00:33:30,717
Ann!

523
00:33:37,224 --> 00:33:38,308
Where is she?

524
00:33:39,309 --> 00:33:42,062
Right over there by the window.

525
00:33:44,542 --> 00:33:45,542
Where?

526
00:33:45,566 --> 00:33:47,818
Where? There's no one here.

527
00:33:53,782 --> 00:33:58,537
I saw it here a few minutes
ago with my own eyes.

528
00:33:58,579 --> 00:34:01,165
Father, what's the matter?

529
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:02,875
Ann! You're safe!

530
00:34:04,001 --> 00:34:05,335
You're all right.

531
00:34:05,377 --> 00:34:06,587
Well of course I am.

532
00:34:06,628 --> 00:34:07,671
Why?

533
00:34:07,713 --> 00:34:09,753
Well Miss Carrington, this
gentleman has just been

534
00:34:09,777 --> 00:34:11,592
telling us that you'd
been murdered.

535
00:34:11,633 --> 00:34:15,054
Oh, Mr. Topper, whatever
gave you that idea?

536
00:34:15,095 --> 00:34:17,556
No, it's not you,
it's the other girl.

537
00:34:17,598 --> 00:34:20,601
I saw her a moment
ago, now really I did.

538
00:34:20,642 --> 00:34:21,453
Where is Gail?

539
00:34:21,477 --> 00:34:22,978
She wasn't downstairs was she?

540
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:25,022
Of course not, how
could she be downstairs

541
00:34:25,064 --> 00:34:26,815
when she was murdered up here?

542
00:34:26,857 --> 00:34:30,277
Now Mr. Topper
please control yourself.

543
00:34:32,279 --> 00:34:34,907
I think I've found something
that might explain matters.

544
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:37,785
It's addressed to
Miss Carrington.

545
00:34:40,996 --> 00:34:43,499
Darling, sorry to run out
on you so mysteriously,

546
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,542
will explain everything
when I get back.

547
00:34:45,584 --> 00:34:46,519
Love, Gail.

548
00:34:46,543 --> 00:34:49,546
Mr. Topper is evidently
suffering from hallucinations.

549
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:52,591
Mr. Topper, how
old a man are you?

550
00:34:54,218 --> 00:34:55,218
46.

551
00:34:58,055 --> 00:34:59,056
Just as I thought.

552
00:34:59,098 --> 00:35:00,658
What do you mean
just as you thought?

553
00:35:00,682 --> 00:35:01,618
Schizophrenia.

554
00:35:01,642 --> 00:35:03,769
Schizophrenia nothing!

555
00:35:03,811 --> 00:35:05,229
I came here in my car,

556
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,081
Your car?

557
00:35:06,105 --> 00:35:09,942
Yes, it's right outside
now, waiting for me.

558
00:35:20,410 --> 00:35:21,495
Huh! Cosmo!

559
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:24,540
Cosmo! Cosmo!

560
00:35:44,893 --> 00:35:46,478
- Edward!
- Yes ma'am.

561
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,664
What in the world
is wrong with you?

562
00:35:47,688 --> 00:35:49,231
It ain't me, it's them things.

563
00:35:49,273 --> 00:35:50,083
Things?

564
00:35:50,107 --> 00:35:52,693
Doors closing by themselves,
people talking to nothing

565
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:55,112
and getting answers,
I'm going back.

566
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:56,697
- Back where?
- To Mr. Benny.

567
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:58,782
Ain't nothing like this
ever happen there.

568
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:00,617
Oh stop all this fiddle faddle.

569
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:01,660
Where's Mr. Topper?

570
00:36:01,702 --> 00:36:03,370
He's over at that
Carrington place.

571
00:36:03,412 --> 00:36:04,872
Oh, that girl again!

572
00:36:04,913 --> 00:36:06,182
You mean the one
that sat in his lap?

573
00:36:06,206 --> 00:36:07,016
I'm afraid so.

574
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,251
Emily get on your clothes,
we're going right over there.

575
00:36:09,293 --> 00:36:12,045
'Scuse me ma'am but
are you able to walk?

576
00:36:12,087 --> 00:36:14,256
Well certainly not,
you're going to drive us.

577
00:36:14,298 --> 00:36:17,968
My my, that's
what I was afraid of.

578
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:18,820
Normal?

579
00:36:18,844 --> 00:36:21,680
As normal as you'd
expect for this type of man.

580
00:36:21,722 --> 00:36:24,016
I've lost the body,
I've lost my car,

581
00:36:24,057 --> 00:36:25,537
if I don't get out
of here very soon,

582
00:36:25,561 --> 00:36:26,727
I'll lose my mind.

583
00:36:26,768 --> 00:36:28,648
What he needs more
than anything else is rest.

584
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:31,106
When he feels better we'll
send him home in my car.

585
00:36:31,148 --> 00:36:32,608
Ann dear, you better go to bed.

586
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:33,543
Good night Mr. Topper.

587
00:36:33,567 --> 00:36:34,651
Good night.

588
00:36:36,737 --> 00:36:39,323
Mr. Topper, Gail's
disappearance has me worried.

589
00:36:39,364 --> 00:36:41,700
Well, look what it's done to me!

590
00:36:41,742 --> 00:36:43,243
Where did you last see her?

591
00:36:43,285 --> 00:36:44,965
She was sitting on
the table in the hall

592
00:36:44,989 --> 00:36:48,409
and she hung my hat
on a Chinaman's foot.

593
00:36:49,583 --> 00:36:52,002
Just take it easy
Mr. Topper, car will be along

594
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:53,462
in a few minutes.

595
00:37:13,315 --> 00:37:15,067
Oh, you remember me?

596
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,361
Yes, of course, but
what are you doing here?

597
00:37:17,402 --> 00:37:18,882
Well, I hate to be
commercial lady,

598
00:37:18,906 --> 00:37:21,031
but somebody owes me 26.80.

599
00:37:21,073 --> 00:37:24,493
Oh, that's right,
I'm sorry I forgot.

600
00:37:24,534 --> 00:37:26,495
You also forgot to say goodbye.

601
00:37:26,536 --> 00:37:29,706
Was a cute disappearing
act you and our partner pulled.

602
00:37:29,748 --> 00:37:31,416
You didn't by chance see her?

603
00:37:31,458 --> 00:37:33,252
You didn't pass her on the road?

604
00:37:33,293 --> 00:37:35,462
No, what is she, sleep walking?

605
00:37:35,504 --> 00:37:38,298
I don't know, but she's gone.

606
00:37:38,340 --> 00:37:39,925
Oh disappeared again.

607
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:42,844
Say she must have been
raised in a magician's hat.

608
00:37:42,886 --> 00:37:45,347
I'll get your money for you.

609
00:37:58,860 --> 00:38:00,529
What's the matter?

610
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,783
Anything wrong?

611
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:08,620
I hate to go up those stairs.

612
00:38:09,830 --> 00:38:12,332
Would you mind coming with me?

613
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,042
Upstairs?

614
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,130
With you?

615
00:38:22,718 --> 00:38:24,078
I better come back
in the morning.

616
00:38:24,102 --> 00:38:26,396
Oh please, won't you come.

617
00:38:27,180 --> 00:38:30,142
Say, are you in a
jam or something?

618
00:38:30,183 --> 00:38:31,727
Just nervous I guess.

619
00:38:31,768 --> 00:38:33,061
Nervous? Why?

620
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:35,439
Well, I can't explain but,

621
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,920
well things have
been happening and...

622
00:38:37,944 --> 00:38:39,484
Well you can stop
worrying honey,

623
00:38:39,526 --> 00:38:40,819
nothing's gonna happen to you.

624
00:38:40,861 --> 00:38:41,861
Come on.

625
00:38:43,238 --> 00:38:45,532
I'd hate to pay the light
bill in a joint like this.

626
00:38:45,574 --> 00:38:47,242
Oh, this is my room.

627
00:38:47,284 --> 00:38:51,288
Well, if you don't
mind, I'll just wait here.

628
00:39:52,766 --> 00:39:54,851
Miss Carrington!
Miss Carrington!

629
00:39:54,893 --> 00:39:55,703
Oh!

630
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,662
What's going on here?

631
00:39:56,686 --> 00:39:58,188
Who's that guy
in the black coat?

632
00:39:58,230 --> 00:39:59,165
What happened to her?

633
00:39:59,189 --> 00:39:59,999
Who are you?

634
00:40:00,023 --> 00:40:00,833
I'm the house keeper.

635
00:40:00,857 --> 00:40:02,537
Fine way to keep
house, women screaming,

636
00:40:02,561 --> 00:40:03,902
boogiemen jumping
out of windows.

637
00:40:03,944 --> 00:40:05,984
If I had a house like this
I wouldn't wanna keep it.

638
00:40:06,008 --> 00:40:08,698
Miss Carrington,
Miss Carrington.

639
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,409
Miss Carrington.

640
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:11,260
What's going on here?

641
00:40:11,284 --> 00:40:12,536
I just said that.

642
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:13,388
Who are you?

643
00:40:13,412 --> 00:40:14,972
And don't tell me you're
this girl's rich uncle.

644
00:40:14,996 --> 00:40:16,289
Don't be silly I'm her father.

645
00:40:16,331 --> 00:40:17,141
Well that's close enough.

646
00:40:17,165 --> 00:40:18,583
Ann! Ann!

647
00:40:18,625 --> 00:40:20,419
She's fainted.

648
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:22,540
I'll betcha the first thing
she says when she opens

649
00:40:22,564 --> 00:40:24,483
her eyes is where am I?

650
00:40:25,298 --> 00:40:26,298
What happened?

651
00:40:27,634 --> 00:40:29,219
Say, what are you doing here?

652
00:40:29,261 --> 00:40:31,304
All right, so I'll
explain it to you.

653
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:33,432
This young lady owes
me for a taxi cab ride.

654
00:40:33,473 --> 00:40:35,809
I came here to collect it,
she asked me up to this room,

655
00:40:35,851 --> 00:40:37,727
I heard her scream and
walked into the middle

656
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,479
of an Orson Wells broadcast.

657
00:40:39,521 --> 00:40:41,356
A man was standing
over me with a knife.

658
00:40:41,398 --> 00:40:42,208
There it is there!

659
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,525
Where did you get that knife?

660
00:40:43,567 --> 00:40:45,287
I found it on the
window in the next room.

661
00:40:45,311 --> 00:40:47,696
Perhaps Topper's
story was right.

662
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:50,907
He said they'd
murdered the other girl.

663
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:52,659
Now they're try to murder Ann!

664
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:54,453
Rama call the police.

665
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:58,107
Oh well now wait a minute,
you don't think I had anything

666
00:40:58,131 --> 00:40:59,100
to do with this.

667
00:40:59,124 --> 00:40:59,976
Do you?

668
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,668
Certainly not.

669
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:04,880
Ann dear, you'd better
get your clothes on.

670
00:41:04,921 --> 00:41:08,967
I'm afraid you're going to
remain here young man.

671
00:41:09,009 --> 00:41:10,778
But good heavens, why
should anybody want to kill

672
00:41:10,802 --> 00:41:11,612
Miss Carrington?

673
00:41:11,636 --> 00:41:12,613
Well, they killed
me, didn't they?

674
00:41:12,637 --> 00:41:14,931
Yes, I can understand
that, but Miss Carrington,

675
00:41:14,973 --> 00:41:16,808
Oh don't worry
about her anymore.

676
00:41:16,850 --> 00:41:18,685
She's got a nice
handsome bodyguard.

677
00:41:18,727 --> 00:41:19,704
He's a taxi driver.

678
00:41:19,728 --> 00:41:21,688
Maybe he's the one
that's doing all the killing.

679
00:41:21,712 --> 00:41:24,316
Nonsense, he didn't bring
his cab in the house with him.

680
00:41:24,357 --> 00:41:26,610
Hm, well then if she's safe,
there's no reason for me

681
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,986
to stay, good night.

682
00:41:28,028 --> 00:41:29,529
I've had a lovely time.

683
00:41:29,571 --> 00:41:31,323
Oh Toppy don't run out now.

684
00:41:31,364 --> 00:41:33,366
Well, you've got to
find out who killed me.

685
00:41:33,408 --> 00:41:35,702
Then we'll know
who's threatening Ann.

686
00:41:35,744 --> 00:41:37,944
Yes, but I don't want my
wife threatening me, you see?

687
00:41:37,986 --> 00:41:39,362
And she will if she finds out.

688
00:41:39,404 --> 00:41:40,957
No, I'm going home.

689
00:41:40,999 --> 00:41:41,999
Oh!

690
00:41:44,461 --> 00:41:46,546
Madam, I'm quite
sure you're mistaken.

691
00:41:46,588 --> 00:41:48,590
I'm not mistaken,
I know I'm not.

692
00:41:48,632 --> 00:41:50,133
I'm Mrs. Topper,
aren't I Edward?

693
00:41:50,175 --> 00:41:51,801
Yes ma'am, but
I don't think that's

694
00:41:51,843 --> 00:41:52,928
what the gentleman means.

695
00:41:52,969 --> 00:41:54,387
I certainly do know what I mean.

696
00:41:54,429 --> 00:41:55,239
Don't I?

697
00:41:55,263 --> 00:41:56,463
Frankly madam, I don't know.

698
00:41:56,487 --> 00:41:57,283
Well, who does?

699
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:59,107
What do you say we
start from the beginning?

700
00:41:59,148 --> 00:42:00,274
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

701
00:42:00,316 --> 00:42:01,394
Where is my husband?

702
00:42:01,436 --> 00:42:02,854
But madam, I don't know.

703
00:42:02,896 --> 00:42:04,314
This is a private home.

704
00:42:04,356 --> 00:42:05,166
Private?

705
00:42:05,190 --> 00:42:06,590
It looks more like
a parade ground.

706
00:42:06,614 --> 00:42:08,276
Can I help you?

707
00:42:08,318 --> 00:42:10,612
You certainly can.

708
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,656
Do you live here?

709
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:13,698
Yes, I do.

710
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:16,660
I'm Mrs. Topper, I'm looking
for my husband, Mr. Topper.

711
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,162
Oh! Where's that
friend of yours?

712
00:42:19,204 --> 00:42:21,248
The one that goes around
sitting on people's laps?

713
00:42:21,289 --> 00:42:22,099
Well I...

714
00:42:22,123 --> 00:42:23,643
She's been murdered
according to your husband.

715
00:42:23,667 --> 00:42:24,876
Don't change the subject.

716
00:42:24,918 --> 00:42:26,354
If you won't help us
we'll find him ourselves.

717
00:42:26,378 --> 00:42:27,420
Come along Emily.

718
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:28,648
I think you'll find him
in the sitting room.

719
00:42:28,672 --> 00:42:29,482
The sitting room.

720
00:42:29,506 --> 00:42:31,066
Maybe she's still
sitting on his lap.

721
00:42:31,107 --> 00:42:31,917
Sitting on his lap!

722
00:42:31,941 --> 00:42:32,777
Good heavens!

723
00:42:32,801 --> 00:42:34,511
You mean you've got
a room just for that?

724
00:42:34,553 --> 00:42:35,887
Where is it?

725
00:42:35,929 --> 00:42:37,222
Right this way.

726
00:42:37,264 --> 00:42:39,891
Come along Emily, come along.

727
00:42:39,933 --> 00:42:41,643
Here she comes,
you've got to go.

728
00:42:41,685 --> 00:42:44,688
I don't trust you bunny,
you tried to run out on me.

729
00:42:44,729 --> 00:42:46,690
How can I run
out with her there?

730
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,858
And how can I face
here with you here?

731
00:42:48,900 --> 00:42:50,235
Well, sounds logical.

732
00:42:50,277 --> 00:42:51,277
Okay, here we go.

733
00:42:53,613 --> 00:42:54,781
Come on fella.

734
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,035
Cosmo!

735
00:43:00,912 --> 00:43:01,912
Cosmo?

736
00:43:02,622 --> 00:43:04,124
Well? Where is he?

737
00:43:04,165 --> 00:43:06,209
He was here a few minutes ago.

738
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:07,627
Rama, what happened to him?

739
00:43:07,669 --> 00:43:09,546
I don't know sir, but
I'm positive he hasn't

740
00:43:09,588 --> 00:43:10,964
- left the house.
- And he won't.

741
00:43:11,006 --> 00:43:13,049
Not till I find him and give
him a piece of my mind.

742
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,551
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

743
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:15,969
Where's the telephone?

744
00:43:16,011 --> 00:43:16,821
Right this way.

745
00:43:16,845 --> 00:43:19,014
Come along Emily.

746
00:43:19,055 --> 00:43:21,516
Come along Edward, Cosmo!

747
00:43:21,558 --> 00:43:22,642
Cosmo! Cosmo!

748
00:43:28,148 --> 00:43:31,943
Operator, operator I want
to report a missing husband.

749
00:43:31,985 --> 00:43:34,571
Edward, you look
for him down that way.

750
00:43:34,613 --> 00:43:36,448
It's awful dark down there.

751
00:43:36,489 --> 00:43:38,408
Darkness never hurt anyone.

752
00:43:38,450 --> 00:43:41,119
It ain't the darkness Mrs.
Topper, it's what's in it.

753
00:43:41,161 --> 00:43:42,721
Don't be silly,
there's no difference

754
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:45,624
between light and dark,
except the lights are out.

755
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:46,665
Run along.

756
00:43:47,667 --> 00:43:51,838
I'll go, but every hair on
my coat is standing on end.

757
00:43:53,965 --> 00:43:55,675
Cosmo Topper?

758
00:43:55,717 --> 00:43:56,968
What's he look like?

759
00:43:57,010 --> 00:43:57,945
Like a banker.

760
00:43:57,969 --> 00:44:01,556
Of course, that's
because he is a banker.

761
00:44:01,598 --> 00:44:03,350
Well, can you describe him?

762
00:44:03,391 --> 00:44:06,895
Well, he wears a size
15 shirt, with a 33 sleeve.

763
00:44:06,936 --> 00:44:09,230
A nine and a half sock lisle,

764
00:44:09,272 --> 00:44:10,857
and is slightly bald.

765
00:44:10,899 --> 00:44:12,692
Oh yes, there's something else.

766
00:44:12,734 --> 00:44:15,094
Let me see, I paid the milkman,
that luncheon's been changed

767
00:44:15,118 --> 00:44:18,740
from Thursday to Friday, oh
yes, there's been a murder.

768
00:44:18,782 --> 00:44:20,075
Murder?

769
00:44:20,116 --> 00:44:21,910
Yes, murder.

770
00:44:21,951 --> 00:44:26,539
Capital M-U-R-D-E-R, murder.

771
00:44:26,581 --> 00:44:28,792
Trying to make these
policemen understand something

772
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:31,586
is harder than
doing it yourself.

773
00:44:36,049 --> 00:44:37,133
Mr. Topper?

774
00:44:38,051 --> 00:44:41,012
Hey Eddie, got a cigarette?

775
00:44:46,142 --> 00:44:47,310
Gimme a match.

776
00:45:28,268 --> 00:45:29,352
Mr. Topper!

777
00:45:30,687 --> 00:45:31,687
Mr. Topper!

778
00:45:33,273 --> 00:45:34,273
Mr. Topper!

779
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,331
Oh Mr. Topper!

780
00:46:21,362 --> 00:46:22,614
Cosmo?

781
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,199
Cosmo?

782
00:46:27,535 --> 00:46:29,204
Cosmo where are you?

783
00:46:35,001 --> 00:46:36,836
Why Toppy!

784
00:46:36,878 --> 00:46:38,213
What are you doing here?

785
00:46:38,254 --> 00:46:39,422
Oh where are you?

786
00:46:39,464 --> 00:46:40,673
Behind the screen.

787
00:46:40,715 --> 00:46:41,525
Oh.

788
00:46:41,549 --> 00:46:42,967
Getting dressed.

789
00:46:43,009 --> 00:46:45,428
Oh little sassy face,
didn't your ma ever tell ya

790
00:46:45,470 --> 00:46:48,306
to knock on a lady's bedroom
door before you barge in?

791
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,350
This is most embarrassing.

792
00:46:50,391 --> 00:46:52,268
Why couldn't you have
stayed the way you were?

793
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:56,481
A negligee is hardly
appropriate for solving crimes.

794
00:47:00,693 --> 00:47:03,863
Come on Toppy,
we've got things to do.

795
00:47:10,745 --> 00:47:11,871
Cosmo!

796
00:47:11,913 --> 00:47:13,832
Gotta get out of here.

797
00:47:13,873 --> 00:47:15,124
Cosmo?

798
00:47:16,793 --> 00:47:18,713
I'm from headquarters,
what's the trouble here?

799
00:47:18,737 --> 00:47:19,396
Troubles here?

800
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:20,797
Now don't stand there dumb!

801
00:47:20,839 --> 00:47:22,519
I got a phone call
about a half an hour ago

802
00:47:22,543 --> 00:47:23,758
that there's been a murder.

803
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,010
And maybe you did it.

804
00:47:26,052 --> 00:47:27,303
Cosmo?

805
00:47:28,721 --> 00:47:30,056
In here quick!

806
00:47:34,227 --> 00:47:35,478
Cosmo? Cosmo?

807
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,024
Oh, this must be the kitchen.

808
00:47:40,066 --> 00:47:42,443
Yeah, well, it's
not the music room.

809
00:47:42,485 --> 00:47:44,654
Well, he's not here.

810
00:47:44,696 --> 00:47:45,589
Cosmo?

811
00:47:45,613 --> 00:47:47,782
Where are earth can he be?

812
00:47:51,035 --> 00:47:52,035
Cosmo?

813
00:47:53,580 --> 00:47:55,081
Cosmo!

814
00:47:55,123 --> 00:47:57,709
My, it's drafty in here.

815
00:47:57,750 --> 00:48:00,461
Oh look at the chocolate cake!

816
00:48:00,503 --> 00:48:02,255
Emily make some tea.

817
00:48:02,297 --> 00:48:03,107
Tea?

818
00:48:03,131 --> 00:48:05,842
Mmmm! Of course,
to go with our cake.

819
00:48:05,884 --> 00:48:07,135
But what about Mr. Topper?

820
00:48:07,176 --> 00:48:09,220
Emily you know
he never drinks tea.

821
00:48:09,262 --> 00:48:11,389
- Well yes I know...
- What.

822
00:48:23,276 --> 00:48:25,778
This is getting
awful monotonous.

823
00:48:25,820 --> 00:48:27,947
Now then, did you
see the face of the man

824
00:48:27,989 --> 00:48:28,799
who wore the cloak?

825
00:48:28,823 --> 00:48:30,700
No it, it was covered up.

826
00:48:30,742 --> 00:48:32,428
Somebody's covering up
a lot of things around here.

827
00:48:32,452 --> 00:48:33,652
Why don't you let her alone?

828
00:48:33,676 --> 00:48:34,676
She's nervous and upset.

829
00:48:34,704 --> 00:48:35,514
She is?

830
00:48:35,538 --> 00:48:36,748
How do you think I feel?

831
00:48:36,789 --> 00:48:38,917
A murder and no body.

832
00:48:38,958 --> 00:48:41,294
Didn't anybody see a body?

833
00:48:41,336 --> 00:48:42,855
Didn't you say Topper
said he saw the body?

834
00:48:42,879 --> 00:48:43,689
Cut the double talk!

835
00:48:43,713 --> 00:48:44,523
Who's Topper?

836
00:48:44,547 --> 00:48:46,341
He's the man who
said he saw the body.

837
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,192
Where is he?

838
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:49,552
- He's gone.
- He's gone?

839
00:48:49,594 --> 00:48:51,137
The body's gone.

840
00:48:51,179 --> 00:48:53,264
Say what are you
people trying to do to me?

841
00:48:53,306 --> 00:48:56,351
I'm sure sergeant it's nothing
but a tempest in a teapot.

842
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,592
Miss Carrington had a note
from the supposedly dead girl

843
00:48:58,616 --> 00:49:00,104
that will clear it all up.

844
00:49:00,146 --> 00:49:00,956
Where's the note?

845
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:02,273
It's gone.

846
00:49:02,315 --> 00:49:03,650
The note's gone?

847
00:49:03,691 --> 00:49:04,668
Topper's gone.

848
00:49:04,692 --> 00:49:05,902
The body's gone!

849
00:49:05,944 --> 00:49:07,278
Now look here!

850
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:11,240
I don't have to come
here to be made a fool of!

851
00:49:14,035 --> 00:49:16,704
Beg pardon sir, but I
believe Miss Carrington

852
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:17,681
left the note upstairs.

853
00:49:17,705 --> 00:49:19,082
Jim, take the boys upstairs.

854
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,875
Search everywhere,
don't miss anything.

855
00:49:20,917 --> 00:49:22,085
Tear it apart!

856
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:25,880
Now look here
Rebecca, quit stalling.

857
00:49:25,922 --> 00:49:27,256
Where is this guy Topper?

858
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:28,341
I don't know.

859
00:49:28,383 --> 00:49:29,652
Well what was he doing
here in the first place?

860
00:49:29,676 --> 00:49:30,486
I don't know.

861
00:49:30,510 --> 00:49:32,220
Say, what do you think I am?

862
00:49:32,261 --> 00:49:33,513
I don't know.

863
00:49:33,554 --> 00:49:34,490
Who's this fresh guy?

864
00:49:34,514 --> 00:49:36,599
Oh, he's all right,
he's a taxi driver.

865
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:37,451
Yeah?

866
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,476
Well where's your taxi?

867
00:49:38,518 --> 00:49:40,478
Now don't tell me
that's disappeared too.

868
00:49:40,520 --> 00:49:41,688
Where do you think it is?

869
00:49:41,729 --> 00:49:43,523
I'm not supposed to think!

870
00:49:43,564 --> 00:49:45,525
I'm from the city hall.

871
00:49:45,566 --> 00:49:46,418
Now where was I?

872
00:49:46,442 --> 00:49:47,694
I don't know.

873
00:49:50,279 --> 00:49:52,699
Emily this cake
is simply delicious.

874
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,717
Glad you like it.

875
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:55,284
It's the best you've ever made.

876
00:49:55,326 --> 00:49:56,261
This is not our cake.

877
00:49:56,285 --> 00:49:58,162
Oh, I forgot.

878
00:49:58,204 --> 00:49:59,580
Some cream, Emily, please?

879
00:49:59,622 --> 00:50:01,207
Cream, yes ma'am.

880
00:50:09,716 --> 00:50:11,801
- Oh, hello.
- Shhh!

881
00:50:15,304 --> 00:50:16,389
Help!

882
00:50:16,431 --> 00:50:17,431
Emily!

883
00:50:18,850 --> 00:50:19,850
Cosmo!

884
00:50:21,102 --> 00:50:23,187
What in the world
are you doing in here?

885
00:50:23,229 --> 00:50:25,106
Just sitting dear.

886
00:50:25,148 --> 00:50:26,733
Bit chilly outside.

887
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:31,154
But you, you never
used to sit in our icebox.

888
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:32,739
Getting out of a nice
warm bed to come

889
00:50:32,780 --> 00:50:34,323
and sit in someone's icebox.

890
00:50:34,365 --> 00:50:36,034
I don't understand it!

891
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:38,369
Oh but I do understand
it don't I, Emily?

892
00:50:38,411 --> 00:50:39,412
I hope so.

893
00:50:40,913 --> 00:50:42,248
That scream came from in here.

894
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,100
Hey look.

895
00:50:43,124 --> 00:50:44,584
A prowler!

896
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:45,436
Who are you?

897
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,211
I'm Mrs. Topper, who are you?

898
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,921
Mrs. Topper!

899
00:50:48,963 --> 00:50:49,815
Where's your husband?

900
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:50,649
In the icebox.

901
00:50:50,673 --> 00:50:51,913
Has he got the body with 'im?

902
00:50:51,937 --> 00:50:54,607
Certainly, under his overcoat.

903
00:51:00,516 --> 00:51:02,685
So you're Topper, huh?

904
00:51:02,727 --> 00:51:05,104
Would you mind coming
out of cold storage?

905
00:51:05,146 --> 00:51:06,606
I will not.

906
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:07,624
Say what's the matter with him?

907
00:51:07,648 --> 00:51:08,733
Is he icebox crazy?

908
00:51:08,775 --> 00:51:10,359
He's suffering
from hallucinations.

909
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:13,237
Oh, you wouldn't by
any chance be thinking

910
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,614
you were a lamb chop?

911
00:51:14,655 --> 00:51:16,824
Now then, what do you mean
by stealing into this house

912
00:51:16,866 --> 00:51:17,718
in the middle of the night?

913
00:51:17,742 --> 00:51:20,102
And what have you done with
that girl you had on your lap?

914
00:51:20,126 --> 00:51:21,496
Girl on his lap, eh?

915
00:51:21,537 --> 00:51:23,790
Ho ho! A love triangle.

916
00:51:23,831 --> 00:51:25,541
Do you really think so officer?

917
00:51:25,583 --> 00:51:27,001
I get it.

918
00:51:27,043 --> 00:51:28,669
You sneaked into
here to see some gal.

919
00:51:28,711 --> 00:51:30,004
Your wife followed.

920
00:51:30,046 --> 00:51:32,206
You had to get rid of the
dame, so you knocked her off.

921
00:51:32,230 --> 00:51:32,941
Yes or no?

922
00:51:32,965 --> 00:51:33,942
I did not.

923
00:51:33,966 --> 00:51:34,777
Where's the body?

924
00:51:34,801 --> 00:51:35,736
I don't know.

925
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:37,595
So you admit there is a body.

926
00:51:37,637 --> 00:51:38,763
Yes.

927
00:51:38,805 --> 00:51:40,765
I came over here to look for it.

928
00:51:40,807 --> 00:51:42,433
Well how'd you know it was here?

929
00:51:42,475 --> 00:51:43,285
She told me.

930
00:51:43,309 --> 00:51:45,019
She? Who's she?

931
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:45,913
The dead girl.

932
00:51:45,937 --> 00:51:48,022
Well, now we're get...

933
00:51:48,064 --> 00:51:49,315
Wait a minute.

934
00:51:49,357 --> 00:51:51,109
How could a dead person talk?

935
00:51:51,150 --> 00:51:54,153
I don't know, but this one does.

936
00:51:54,195 --> 00:51:56,948
Oh, I mean, I know you
won't believe what I'm going

937
00:51:56,989 --> 00:51:58,157
to tell you but...

938
00:51:58,199 --> 00:51:59,617
Well we certainly won't!

939
00:51:59,659 --> 00:52:01,339
Where were you when
the attempt was made

940
00:52:01,363 --> 00:52:02,787
on Miss Carrington's life?

941
00:52:02,829 --> 00:52:05,081
In the library, I
think, I don't know.

942
00:52:05,123 --> 00:52:07,959
Did you or did you not
try to stab this young lady?

943
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:11,546
Don't be ridiculous officer,
Cosmo wouldn't stab anybody.

944
00:52:11,587 --> 00:52:14,382
He can't even carve a turkey.

945
00:52:14,423 --> 00:52:18,469
Now listen lady, somebody
kills a dame who talks

946
00:52:18,511 --> 00:52:22,557
after she's dead and the
body gets up and walks away.

947
00:52:22,598 --> 00:52:25,101
Somebody tried to
whittle on this young lady,

948
00:52:25,143 --> 00:52:27,019
and I find him
hiding in the icebox!

949
00:52:27,061 --> 00:52:28,104
Here Toppy, take this.

950
00:52:28,146 --> 00:52:29,897
- I don't want it.
- He gets his wish.

951
00:52:29,939 --> 00:52:31,774
You mean you're
going to arrest him?

952
00:52:31,816 --> 00:52:33,860
Well, these ain't exactly
charm bracelets lady.

953
00:52:33,901 --> 00:52:34,901
Oh!

954
00:52:37,363 --> 00:52:39,157
He's got a gun!

955
00:52:39,198 --> 00:52:40,491
It's mine!

956
00:52:40,533 --> 00:52:43,202
Cosmo, give the
man back his gun.

957
00:52:43,244 --> 00:52:44,096
Don't do that.

958
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:46,122
Cosmo!

959
00:52:46,164 --> 00:52:46,974
Call out somebody!

960
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:48,416
Cosmo you'll hurt yourself!

961
00:52:48,457 --> 00:52:49,268
Riley you'll wind up
in the sticks for this!

962
00:52:49,292 --> 00:52:51,335
Don't do that, stop it.

963
00:52:51,377 --> 00:52:53,171
It might go off!

964
00:52:59,802 --> 00:53:01,137
Come on!

965
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:02,114
You shouldn't do that!

966
00:53:02,138 --> 00:53:03,723
They'll catch cold.

967
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:15,067
Let go of me! Let go of me!

968
00:53:17,481 --> 00:53:18,881
You shouldn't have
made me do that.

969
00:53:18,905 --> 00:53:19,715
You wanna go to jail?

970
00:53:19,739 --> 00:53:21,157
No, but we can't
go on like this.

971
00:53:21,199 --> 00:53:23,367
My wife, the police, what
do you suppose they think!

972
00:53:23,409 --> 00:53:24,970
They think you're guilty of
house breaking and murder.

973
00:53:24,994 --> 00:53:26,537
- Yes.
- Come on, let's find my body.

974
00:53:26,579 --> 00:53:28,348
No, because after we
do find it then I will be

975
00:53:28,372 --> 00:53:29,224
accused of murdering you.

976
00:53:29,248 --> 00:53:31,168
But I've got evidence
to prove you're innocent.

977
00:53:31,209 --> 00:53:32,144
- What evidence?
- This note

978
00:53:32,168 --> 00:53:34,462
I was supposed to have
written Ann but didn't.

979
00:53:34,503 --> 00:53:35,314
Who did?

980
00:53:35,338 --> 00:53:37,548
I'll tell you when we find me.

981
00:53:37,590 --> 00:53:38,590
Come on.

982
00:53:48,286 --> 00:53:49,286
You're tired?

983
00:53:49,310 --> 00:53:51,312
How you think I feel?

984
00:55:01,859 --> 00:55:02,859
My goodness!

985
00:55:02,883 --> 00:55:04,343
What makes it so cold in here?

986
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:06,280
Bless you.

987
00:55:06,304 --> 00:55:08,139
You and your husband!

988
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:10,266
When it comes to picking
out husbands, Mrs. Topper,

989
00:55:10,308 --> 00:55:11,851
you certainly take the cake.

990
00:55:11,892 --> 00:55:14,312
I only took a small piece
and a little cup of tea.

991
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,397
That's no reason we
should be locked up in here.

992
00:55:16,439 --> 00:55:18,039
Look Mrs. Topper,
I'm not complaining,

993
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,735
but I'm a personal maid,
and not Admiral Burrs.

994
00:55:20,776 --> 00:55:22,194
Oh Emily, shut up.

995
00:55:22,236 --> 00:55:23,276
We'll all get pneumonia.

996
00:55:23,300 --> 00:55:24,697
Can't you break down that door?

997
00:55:24,739 --> 00:55:26,157
It's as solid as a rock.

998
00:55:26,843 --> 00:55:27,843
Come in!

999
00:55:27,867 --> 00:55:28,677
Quiet!

1000
00:55:28,701 --> 00:55:29,869
What's the funny noise?

1001
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,412
That's my teeth chattering!

1002
00:55:31,454 --> 00:55:33,289
Well why don't you
put 'em in your pocket?

1003
00:55:33,331 --> 00:55:34,498
Who has a screw driver?

1004
00:55:34,540 --> 00:55:36,180
You need a screw
driver to get 'em out?

1005
00:55:36,204 --> 00:55:37,501
I've got a button hook.

1006
00:55:37,543 --> 00:55:38,353
Where is it?

1007
00:55:38,377 --> 00:55:39,545
Home on my dresser.

1008
00:55:39,587 --> 00:55:41,297
Oh my, come on,
everybody look around,

1009
00:55:41,339 --> 00:55:44,216
there oughta be
something here we can use.

1010
00:55:44,258 --> 00:55:47,219
Well, there's nothing in this
joint but frozen tomatoes and,

1011
00:55:47,261 --> 00:55:48,071
And dead chickens.

1012
00:55:48,095 --> 00:55:49,655
Look, can you do
something with this?

1013
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:50,723
Oh, I give up.

1014
00:55:50,765 --> 00:55:52,683
May I suggest sir, that
you break the glass.

1015
00:55:52,725 --> 00:55:53,535
What?

1016
00:55:53,559 --> 00:55:54,369
Break the glass.

1017
00:55:54,393 --> 00:55:56,103
Okay.

1018
00:55:56,145 --> 00:55:57,039
So what good did that do?

1019
00:55:57,063 --> 00:55:59,523
He means the glass
in the door, dummy.

1020
00:55:59,565 --> 00:56:01,645
Okay, but I think you're
taking a lot of liberties.

1021
00:56:01,669 --> 00:56:02,669
- Look out.
- Oh!

1022
00:56:14,663 --> 00:56:17,458
Now wait a minute,
I'll take charge of this.

1023
00:56:17,500 --> 00:56:19,740
Riley you take the upstairs,
and you take the downstairs.

1024
00:56:19,764 --> 00:56:20,437
You take this.

1025
00:56:20,461 --> 00:56:22,713
Personally I think someone
should call the police.

1026
00:56:22,755 --> 00:56:24,590
Well, I'll take care of that.

1027
00:56:24,632 --> 00:56:27,051
Check that for finger prints.

1028
00:56:38,020 --> 00:56:39,605
- Hear that?
- Yeah.

1029
00:57:06,109 --> 00:57:07,109
Shhhh.

1030
00:57:07,133 --> 00:57:09,635
Quiet Toppy, don't be nervous.

1031
00:57:23,566 --> 00:57:24,650
Gimme that.

1032
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:26,920
Eddie!

1033
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:28,779
Where have you been?

1034
00:57:28,821 --> 00:57:30,823
Boss, that's something
I'll never know.

1035
00:57:30,865 --> 00:57:31,842
You still looking for a body?

1036
00:57:31,866 --> 00:57:32,908
Yes.

1037
00:57:32,950 --> 00:57:36,287
It was down
there, but it just left.

1038
00:57:36,328 --> 00:57:37,621
It left?

1039
00:57:37,663 --> 00:57:39,331
It just put out to sea.

1040
00:57:39,373 --> 00:57:42,293
That's the truth boss, but I
ain't going back to prove it.

1041
00:57:42,334 --> 00:57:44,545
Oh yes you are.

1042
00:57:44,587 --> 00:57:46,046
Yes sir.

1043
00:57:46,088 --> 00:57:49,675
My my, the things
I get myself into.

1044
00:57:49,717 --> 00:57:50,717
Come on.

1045
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:36,639
Eddie, you're going to stay
right here until we get back.

1046
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:37,680
Yes sir.

1047
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:42,686
But don't bet on it unless
you get awful good odds.

1048
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:56,408
Oh Toppy, you're
terrible at rowing a boat.

1049
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:59,620
Get up front and
let me do the rowing.

1050
00:59:03,832 --> 00:59:05,751
Here we go, hold tight.

1051
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:17,346
No it ain't.

1052
00:59:24,436 --> 00:59:25,436
Yes it is!

1053
00:59:26,939 --> 00:59:29,775
If you go out, I'm
going with you.

1054
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:32,736
Hurry, help me up.

1055
00:59:32,778 --> 00:59:33,713
Give me your hand.

1056
00:59:33,737 --> 00:59:35,406
Why do it the hard way?

1057
00:59:35,447 --> 00:59:36,991
Thems the orders
I got from the boss

1058
00:59:37,032 --> 00:59:39,493
and thems the orders
I'm passing on to you.

1059
00:59:39,535 --> 00:59:40,786
Gonna do it my way, see?

1060
00:59:40,828 --> 00:59:42,329
Can't a guy ask questions?

1061
00:59:42,371 --> 00:59:43,581
No!

1062
00:59:43,622 --> 00:59:45,040
I say were dump her here.

1063
00:59:45,082 --> 00:59:46,762
Right where we dumped
Butch and Liverlimp.

1064
00:59:46,786 --> 00:59:48,794
South 10 miles and plenty deep.

1065
00:59:48,836 --> 00:59:51,630
Oh why not wrap her
up in a concrete mudpack

1066
00:59:51,672 --> 00:59:53,424
and drop her right here?

1067
00:59:53,465 --> 00:59:55,217
The tide'll take her out.

1068
00:59:55,259 --> 00:59:58,012
That's the boss's orders
and don't argue with me!

1069
00:59:58,053 --> 00:59:59,763
Go below and get
that engine started.

1070
00:59:59,805 --> 01:00:00,889
Okay.

1071
01:00:13,027 --> 01:00:15,029
Gail! Come here quick!

1072
01:00:16,989 --> 01:00:18,741
Here you are in here.

1073
01:00:19,658 --> 01:00:22,578
Oh dear, I look
so uncomfortable.

1074
01:00:33,899 --> 01:00:34,899
Start the engine.

1075
01:00:34,923 --> 01:00:36,091
We've gotta get off.

1076
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:40,262
No, you lower the boat,
and I'll take care of them.

1077
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:03,744
Keep that engine running!

1078
01:01:03,786 --> 01:01:05,996
I had it running, it stopped.

1079
01:01:06,038 --> 01:01:06,931
What stopped it?

1080
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:08,207
I don't know.

1081
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:13,128
Ya dummy!

1082
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:14,610
How do you expect
that engine to run

1083
01:01:14,634 --> 01:01:16,887
with the juiced turned off?

1084
01:01:18,092 --> 01:01:19,301
Gimme that.

1085
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:21,637
Come on, get out of the way.

1086
01:01:27,059 --> 01:01:28,560
See? That's going.

1087
01:01:40,364 --> 01:01:41,364
Turn it on!

1088
01:01:42,449 --> 01:01:43,784
And leave it on.

1089
01:02:10,853 --> 01:02:11,895
I didn't do it!

1090
01:02:11,937 --> 01:02:13,355
Honest, I didn't.

1091
01:02:44,970 --> 01:02:46,847
Come on Toppy.

1092
01:02:58,692 --> 01:03:00,235
What are you doing here?

1093
01:03:00,277 --> 01:03:01,877
If you'd asked me
that a second later,

1094
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:04,904
you'd have been
talking to yourself.

1095
01:03:30,182 --> 01:03:31,502
What have you got in that boat?

1096
01:03:31,526 --> 01:03:32,202
The body.

1097
01:03:32,226 --> 01:03:33,036
That does it.

1098
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:34,436
No ya don't.

1099
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,562
Trying to hide it, huh?

1100
01:03:35,604 --> 01:03:37,981
No, no, I'm bringing it back.

1101
01:03:38,023 --> 01:03:39,066
Bringing it back.

1102
01:03:39,107 --> 01:03:42,319
Well, brother you've got a
lot of questions to answer.

1103
01:03:42,361 --> 01:03:44,780
I gotta hunch, it ain't
gonna be no quiz program.

1104
01:03:44,822 --> 01:03:46,824
Joe take 'em upstairs.

1105
01:03:52,807 --> 01:03:53,807
Everybody here?

1106
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:54,998
Yes sir, all here.

1107
01:03:55,040 --> 01:03:58,877
All right, now get
this and get it straight.

1108
01:03:59,837 --> 01:04:03,173
Nobody leaves this
room unless I say so.

1109
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:06,552
And you, stop chewing that gum.

1110
01:04:06,593 --> 01:04:07,403
Chewin'?

1111
01:04:07,427 --> 01:04:08,554
I ain't even breathin'!

1112
01:04:08,595 --> 01:04:10,472
Not you, her.

1113
01:04:13,141 --> 01:04:15,269
I'm sorry Miss Carrington,
I know this is gonna be

1114
01:04:15,310 --> 01:04:16,603
a bit unpleasant for you,

1115
01:04:16,645 --> 01:04:20,816
but would you mind stepping
into the next room with me?

1116
01:04:34,246 --> 01:04:38,166
Miss Carrington, I'm
going to raise this sheet.

1117
01:04:39,626 --> 01:04:43,463
See if you can
identify this young lady.

1118
01:04:59,748 --> 01:05:01,028
How long's she been living here?

1119
01:05:01,052 --> 01:05:04,806
She came here tonight
with Miss Carrington.

1120
01:05:06,528 --> 01:05:08,572
Nice looking gal.

1121
01:05:08,614 --> 01:05:11,199
Too bad she had to go so young.

1122
01:05:12,534 --> 01:05:14,912
She's got awful big feet though.

1123
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:20,000
Who did that?

1124
01:05:20,083 --> 01:05:22,794
Who hit me when
I wasn't looking?

1125
01:05:22,836 --> 01:05:25,088
Was you in that room just now?

1126
01:05:25,130 --> 01:05:27,215
Not now, then, or ever.

1127
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,761
Don't tell me the
joint's haunted.

1128
01:05:30,802 --> 01:05:33,597
Now look, I was
standing in that room,

1129
01:05:33,639 --> 01:05:35,223
minding my own business.

1130
01:05:35,265 --> 01:05:37,643
Just as I say what
big feet she's got,

1131
01:05:37,684 --> 01:05:38,804
I get slapped in the kisser.

1132
01:05:41,396 --> 01:05:42,481
Who did that?

1133
01:05:50,174 --> 01:05:51,174
Who went out that door?

1134
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:52,008
Nobody.

1135
01:05:52,032 --> 01:05:53,712
Now wait a minute,
doors just don't open

1136
01:05:53,753 --> 01:05:54,754
and shut themselves.

1137
01:05:54,796 --> 01:05:56,662
Yeah, but that one did.

1138
01:05:57,746 --> 01:05:59,331
Hey, who went out that door.

1139
01:05:59,373 --> 01:06:00,457
- You're who-ty.
- Who?

1140
01:06:00,499 --> 01:06:01,434
You feel better dear?

1141
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:03,138
Well, she'd be all
right if Charlie Chan

1142
01:06:03,162 --> 01:06:04,294
had let her alone.

1143
01:06:04,336 --> 01:06:06,838
Sergeant Roberts, I
don't like to interfere,

1144
01:06:06,880 --> 01:06:09,967
but is it necessary to subject
my daughter to all of this?

1145
01:06:10,008 --> 01:06:11,426
She's terribly nervous.

1146
01:06:11,468 --> 01:06:14,346
Won't you, would you
please let her go to her room?

1147
01:06:14,388 --> 01:06:15,889
Nobody leaves this room.

1148
01:06:15,931 --> 01:06:20,268
Not even me, and that
goes for the both of us.

1149
01:06:24,940 --> 01:06:26,233
Big feet, huh?

1150
01:06:26,274 --> 01:06:29,027
I'll match mine
with his any day.

1151
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:36,010
Have another.

1152
01:06:36,034 --> 01:06:40,747
Don't mind if I do.

1153
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:42,499
Innocent men stay home nights.

1154
01:06:42,541 --> 01:06:44,292
They don't hide in iceboxes.

1155
01:06:44,334 --> 01:06:47,254
And they don't take
dead bodies on boat rides.

1156
01:06:47,295 --> 01:06:48,630
Why did you kill her?

1157
01:06:48,672 --> 01:06:49,840
I didn't.

1158
01:06:49,881 --> 01:06:52,551
That's only one man's opinion.

1159
01:06:52,592 --> 01:06:53,969
I can prove it.

1160
01:06:54,011 --> 01:06:55,011
How?

1161
01:06:55,679 --> 01:06:58,432
Leave me alone in
that room for a minute.

1162
01:06:58,473 --> 01:06:59,683
Ho ho!

1163
01:06:59,725 --> 01:07:01,143
I'm not that dumb.

1164
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,895
Well, that's only one
man's opinion too.

1165
01:07:03,937 --> 01:07:05,647
Officer let him have his way.

1166
01:07:05,689 --> 01:07:07,357
There are no windows
in the trophy room.

1167
01:07:07,399 --> 01:07:08,567
Any iceboxes?

1168
01:07:08,608 --> 01:07:09,419
No.

1169
01:07:09,443 --> 01:07:11,945
All right, I'll give
you three minutes.

1170
01:07:11,987 --> 01:07:15,198
If you're not back in this
room with a 14 karat alibi

1171
01:07:15,240 --> 01:07:17,360
this lady's gonna make one
of the most charming widows

1172
01:07:17,384 --> 01:07:18,910
I've ever met.

1173
01:07:18,952 --> 01:07:22,956
Thank you officer.

1174
01:07:26,877 --> 01:07:29,129
Gail, Gail where are you?

1175
01:07:33,925 --> 01:07:35,385
Just getting
another bottle Toppy.

1176
01:07:35,427 --> 01:07:37,095
Be right with you.

1177
01:07:37,137 --> 01:07:41,683
You and I'll have a
little drink together.

1178
01:07:41,725 --> 01:07:43,143
Whoops, catch me!

1179
01:07:45,771 --> 01:07:47,022
Good boy Toppy.

1180
01:07:47,064 --> 01:07:48,231
Don't drop me.

1181
01:07:51,234 --> 01:07:53,278
Now you stand up
and behave yourself.

1182
01:07:53,320 --> 01:07:55,989
Sweetie, lemme muss your hair.

1183
01:07:56,031 --> 01:07:57,491
Stop it, will you stop it?

1184
01:07:57,532 --> 01:08:00,327
This is no time to be playful.

1185
01:08:00,368 --> 01:08:02,287
Where's that note?

1186
01:08:02,329 --> 01:08:03,955
What note?

1187
01:08:03,997 --> 01:08:05,874
The proof you said you had.

1188
01:08:05,916 --> 01:08:08,502
Toppy, I wanna lie down.

1189
01:08:08,543 --> 01:08:09,836
I'm sleepy.

1190
01:08:10,712 --> 01:08:11,838
You can't get sleepy now.

1191
01:08:11,880 --> 01:08:14,341
You got me into this and
you've got to get me out of it.

1192
01:08:14,382 --> 01:08:15,509
Gimme a hand.

1193
01:08:15,550 --> 01:08:17,552
Oh dear, here come on.

1194
01:08:19,179 --> 01:08:20,764
Toppy, I feel so silly.

1195
01:08:21,640 --> 01:08:22,974
Quiet.

1196
01:08:24,101 --> 01:08:26,436
It's like being on
a row boat in here.

1197
01:08:26,478 --> 01:08:28,939
Try to walk straight.

1198
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:31,983
Oh! Look at the pretty couch.

1199
01:08:32,025 --> 01:08:32,835
There.

1200
01:08:32,859 --> 01:08:33,985
Ahh.

1201
01:08:37,030 --> 01:08:39,282
That feels so good.

1202
01:08:39,324 --> 01:08:41,159
Toppy, put my feet up.

1203
01:08:41,201 --> 01:08:42,201
Oh.

1204
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:48,291
Gail, this is serious.

1205
01:08:48,333 --> 01:08:49,626
Where is that note?

1206
01:08:49,668 --> 01:08:51,086
I don't know.

1207
01:08:51,128 --> 01:08:52,528
Try to think what
you did with it

1208
01:08:52,552 --> 01:08:53,797
or I'll be arrested.

1209
01:08:53,839 --> 01:08:55,465
Put a cold towel
on my head sweetie,

1210
01:08:55,507 --> 01:08:57,425
and I'll try and think.

1211
01:09:00,929 --> 01:09:05,100
Do please, try and pull
yourself together will you?

1212
01:09:23,952 --> 01:09:26,454
Got a little headache, you know.

1213
01:09:26,496 --> 01:09:28,999
Have you got an asprin on you?

1214
01:09:30,625 --> 01:09:32,878
No, but I'll get you one.

1215
01:09:38,508 --> 01:09:40,218
Well that settles it.

1216
01:09:40,260 --> 01:09:43,054
That guy's as nutty
as a candy bar.

1217
01:09:43,096 --> 01:09:44,556
Send for a straight jacket.

1218
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:46,600
Make it two, one for me.

1219
01:09:49,644 --> 01:09:50,644
Get up!

1220
01:09:52,606 --> 01:09:54,441
Now where's that note?

1221
01:09:58,403 --> 01:09:59,821
There it is down there.

1222
01:09:59,863 --> 01:10:00,863
Huh? Oh.

1223
01:10:05,911 --> 01:10:06,995
What does this prove?

1224
01:10:07,037 --> 01:10:08,330
I didn't write it.

1225
01:10:08,371 --> 01:10:09,182
Who did?

1226
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,458
Lillian the house keeper.

1227
01:10:11,499 --> 01:10:14,502
Here's a sample
of her hand writing.

1228
01:10:16,690 --> 01:10:17,690
They're identical.

1229
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:19,132
Mmhm.

1230
01:10:19,174 --> 01:10:20,425
Then she must be in on it.

1231
01:10:20,467 --> 01:10:21,760
Mmhm.

1232
01:10:21,801 --> 01:10:22,801
Sit down.

1233
01:10:26,264 --> 01:10:29,392
You admit you wrote
that letter don't you?

1234
01:10:29,434 --> 01:10:30,477
Yes.

1235
01:10:30,518 --> 01:10:31,798
And this is the note you found

1236
01:10:31,822 --> 01:10:33,647
in the murdered girl's room?

1237
01:10:33,688 --> 01:10:34,731
Yes.

1238
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:36,653
Then how do you account
for they're both being

1239
01:10:36,677 --> 01:10:38,568
in the same hand writing?

1240
01:10:38,610 --> 01:10:39,819
I don't know.

1241
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:42,364
Listen sister, it looks
like you're all set

1242
01:10:42,405 --> 01:10:44,574
for a first degree murder wrap.

1243
01:10:44,616 --> 01:10:46,785
Of course, if you come
clean, we could go a little

1244
01:10:46,826 --> 01:10:47,637
easier on ya.

1245
01:10:47,661 --> 01:10:49,120
I wasn't alone in this.

1246
01:10:49,162 --> 01:10:51,206
I wrote the note,
but I didn't kill her.

1247
01:10:51,248 --> 01:10:52,249
Who did?

1248
01:10:59,214 --> 01:11:01,132
Come on, who did it?

1249
01:11:01,174 --> 01:11:02,550
It, it was...

1250
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,305
Turn on the lights, quick!

1251
01:11:07,347 --> 01:11:09,140
Come on now who...

1252
01:11:09,182 --> 01:11:11,017
There's a pick
pocket in the joint.

1253
01:11:11,059 --> 01:11:13,019
Whoever stole that
witness, put her back.

1254
01:11:13,061 --> 01:11:14,741
Jim, search the cellar,
search the icebox,

1255
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:15,581
search the attic.

1256
01:11:15,605 --> 01:11:16,940
- Where's the attic?
- Search me.

1257
01:11:16,982 --> 01:11:20,360
I've been in politics 10 years
and I've never seen anything

1258
01:11:20,402 --> 01:11:22,404
as balled up as this is.

1259
01:11:24,322 --> 01:11:25,949
Darrel, guard that front door.

1260
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:27,117
Don't let anybody in or out.

1261
01:11:27,158 --> 01:11:28,135
What's down there?

1262
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:29,494
That's the kitchen.

1263
01:11:29,536 --> 01:11:32,747
If I find that dame in
the icebox I'll resign.

1264
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,541
And I'll drop dead.

1265
01:11:34,582 --> 01:11:38,253
Oh come, come now
brace up, brace up.

1266
01:11:38,295 --> 01:11:40,088
I'd appreciate it so
much if you'd stay here

1267
01:11:40,130 --> 01:11:41,548
with my daughter.

1268
01:11:41,589 --> 01:11:43,174
I want to talk to
Sergeant Roberts.

1269
01:11:43,216 --> 01:11:44,301
It'll be a pleasure sir.

1270
01:11:44,342 --> 01:11:45,343
Come come.

1271
01:11:52,327 --> 01:11:53,327
Now I got ya!

1272
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:55,520
Oh! You horrible man!

1273
01:11:55,562 --> 01:11:57,522
I see no reason for us
to stay in this awful house

1274
01:11:57,546 --> 01:11:59,524
while you go around
opening and shutting doors.

1275
01:11:59,566 --> 01:12:00,376
Quiet.

1276
01:12:00,400 --> 01:12:02,110
I will not be quiet!

1277
01:12:02,152 --> 01:12:03,570
I'm so nervous I could scream.

1278
01:12:03,611 --> 01:12:05,196
In fact, I think I will.

1279
01:12:08,074 --> 01:12:10,827
Oh! That's fun, isn't it?

1280
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:14,112
Come on, let's do it together.

1281
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:17,292
Stay here.

1282
01:12:20,378 --> 01:12:22,213
Sounds like my wife.

1283
01:13:00,377 --> 01:13:02,087
Miss Carrington?

1284
01:13:02,128 --> 01:13:04,881
Miss Carrington?
Miss Carrington?

1285
01:13:05,882 --> 01:13:07,217
Miss Carrington?

1286
01:13:09,029 --> 01:13:10,029
Well, where is she?

1287
01:13:10,053 --> 01:13:11,679
She was here a second ago.

1288
01:13:11,721 --> 01:13:12,972
Oh what's happened now?

1289
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,641
Miss Carrington's disappeared.

1290
01:13:14,682 --> 01:13:15,934
Well I left her with him.

1291
01:13:15,975 --> 01:13:18,436
Say what is this, the
fun house at the beach?

1292
01:13:18,478 --> 01:13:20,939
Everybody that talks
to you disappears.

1293
01:13:20,980 --> 01:13:22,524
Now I'm talking to ya.

1294
01:13:22,565 --> 01:13:24,442
I supposed I'll turn up missing.

1295
01:13:24,484 --> 01:13:26,653
That is the best suggestion
you've made tonight.

1296
01:13:26,694 --> 01:13:28,822
Well, that's all right.

1297
01:13:28,863 --> 01:13:31,366
Don't you ever
park near a fire plug.

1298
01:13:31,408 --> 01:13:32,218
As for you...

1299
01:13:32,242 --> 01:13:34,994
Officer, I want to go home.

1300
01:13:35,036 --> 01:13:36,955
I'll tell you when to go.

1301
01:13:36,996 --> 01:13:39,499
And I'll tell you where to go.

1302
01:13:39,541 --> 01:13:40,541
Sit down.

1303
01:13:51,761 --> 01:13:54,055
Gail, Ann has disappeared.

1304
01:13:54,097 --> 01:13:54,907
Disappeared?

1305
01:13:54,931 --> 01:13:55,741
Entirely.

1306
01:13:55,765 --> 01:13:57,100
Well we've got to find her!

1307
01:13:57,142 --> 01:13:59,144
Police won't let
me out of their sight.

1308
01:13:59,185 --> 01:14:01,354
Well they can't stop me.

1309
01:14:03,565 --> 01:14:06,276
Don't go out there, Mrs.
Topper's just outside.

1310
01:14:06,317 --> 01:14:07,819
I'll fix that.

1311
01:14:16,619 --> 01:14:18,371
Well, where is she?

1312
01:14:19,289 --> 01:14:20,665
Where is who dear?

1313
01:14:20,707 --> 01:14:22,208
You know perfectly
well who I mean!

1314
01:14:22,250 --> 01:14:23,793
That, that girl.

1315
01:14:23,835 --> 01:14:24,645
There wasn't any.

1316
01:14:24,669 --> 01:14:25,563
Oh yes there was.

1317
01:14:25,587 --> 01:14:27,714
I heard you both in that room.

1318
01:14:27,755 --> 01:14:30,550
Pardon me Mrs. Topper,
but it's getting kinda late,

1319
01:14:30,592 --> 01:14:31,843
can't we settle this at home?

1320
01:14:31,885 --> 01:14:33,219
Edward, don't interrupt.

1321
01:14:33,261 --> 01:14:34,029
Yes'm.

1322
01:14:34,053 --> 01:14:36,639
Cosmo, I should think
after 20 years of married life

1323
01:14:36,681 --> 01:14:38,308
you wouldn't try to deceive me.

1324
01:14:38,349 --> 01:14:41,019
Why I remember our
honeymoon in Atlantic City.

1325
01:14:41,060 --> 01:14:43,021
You promised me you'd
never look at another woman.

1326
01:14:43,062 --> 01:14:44,147
Mr. Topper!

1327
01:14:54,092 --> 01:14:55,212
You better keep away from me

1328
01:14:55,236 --> 01:14:56,904
or you'll be a coat.

1329
01:16:28,334 --> 01:16:29,419
Hey!

1330
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:32,213
Taxi?

1331
01:16:47,645 --> 01:16:50,273
Clara please, I've
had a frightful night.

1332
01:16:50,315 --> 01:16:51,250
Boss wait!

1333
01:16:51,274 --> 01:16:52,859
Don't sit in that chair!

1334
01:16:52,900 --> 01:16:55,111
Whatever you do
don't sit in that chair.

1335
01:16:55,153 --> 01:16:57,822
Edward will you
stop interrupting?

1336
01:16:57,864 --> 01:16:59,407
Why you're all wet.

1337
01:16:59,449 --> 01:17:00,533
Is it raining out?

1338
01:17:00,575 --> 01:17:02,160
Oh, but you haven't been out.

1339
01:17:02,201 --> 01:17:03,578
Can't be raining in.

1340
01:17:03,620 --> 01:17:05,622
Well, if it has,
it's all cleared up.

1341
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,332
I can't stand much more.

1342
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:08,933
Oh oh boss, that's
chair's deceptive,

1343
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,918
destructible, distrust worthy

1344
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:12,587
and this is the
voice of experience.

1345
01:17:12,629 --> 01:17:14,297
What are you talking about?

1346
01:17:14,339 --> 01:17:17,091
Boss you sit in that chair
and things happen, quick.

1347
01:17:17,133 --> 01:17:18,593
Oh don't talk nonsense.

1348
01:17:18,635 --> 01:17:19,445
It ain't nonsense.

1349
01:17:19,469 --> 01:17:20,470
It's serious.

1350
01:17:20,511 --> 01:17:24,682
Look boss, I sat in
that chair just like this.

1351
01:17:24,724 --> 01:17:26,976
Cross my leg just like this.

1352
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:29,437
Leaned back, here I go again.

1353
01:17:31,105 --> 01:17:32,825
Well that's a silly
way to leave the room.

1354
01:17:32,857 --> 01:17:34,233
Why didn't he use the door?

1355
01:17:34,275 --> 01:17:35,610
Mr. Topper!

1356
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,365
Well, as I was saying,
I'll always stand by you

1357
01:17:40,406 --> 01:17:41,574
no matter what happens.

1358
01:17:41,616 --> 01:17:43,743
Yes dear just be
quiet will you please?

1359
01:17:43,785 --> 01:17:45,465
Well if that's the
way you feel about it,

1360
01:17:45,489 --> 01:17:47,575
I won't say another word.

1361
01:18:06,057 --> 01:18:07,767
Cosmo, what a charming idea.

1362
01:18:07,809 --> 01:18:09,409
We should have one
of these in our house

1363
01:18:09,433 --> 01:18:11,685
for weekend guests, really.

1364
01:18:14,273 --> 01:18:17,694
Clara for heaven
sake get out of there.

1365
01:18:25,702 --> 01:18:27,495
Okay you take it down this way,

1366
01:18:27,537 --> 01:18:28,430
and you go upstairs.

1367
01:18:28,454 --> 01:18:30,915
If you find anything
I'll be right here.

1368
01:18:30,957 --> 01:18:32,458
Boy what a night.

1369
01:18:32,500 --> 01:18:36,671
I've never been on such a
merry-go-round in my life!

1370
01:18:39,799 --> 01:18:41,300
Oh, I sure needed that one.

1371
01:18:41,342 --> 01:18:43,469
Toppy, I just saw the
murder in the cellar.

1372
01:18:43,511 --> 01:18:44,321
- Who is he?
- I don't know,

1373
01:18:44,345 --> 01:18:45,346
I couldn't see his face.

1374
01:18:45,388 --> 01:18:47,515
But he was all muffled
up in a big black cloak.

1375
01:18:47,557 --> 01:18:49,350
Well, whoever he is,
he was in that room

1376
01:18:49,392 --> 01:18:50,727
when the housekeeper
disappeared.

1377
01:18:50,768 --> 01:18:52,648
Because I found the
contraption in the fireplace

1378
01:18:52,672 --> 01:18:54,439
that operates the
chair she was sitting on.

1379
01:18:54,480 --> 01:18:55,290
- Toppy, - What?

1380
01:18:55,314 --> 01:18:57,692
We've got to make
him convict himself.

1381
01:18:57,734 --> 01:18:58,711
How?

1382
01:18:58,735 --> 01:19:01,112
You sit in that chair, and
tell them that you know

1383
01:19:01,154 --> 01:19:02,447
who the murder is.

1384
01:19:02,488 --> 01:19:03,424
Me?

1385
01:19:03,448 --> 01:19:04,741
Sitting in that chair?

1386
01:19:04,782 --> 01:19:06,075
But I'll disappear too.

1387
01:19:06,117 --> 01:19:08,119
Oh no, not if you keep
your eye on the fireplace.

1388
01:19:08,161 --> 01:19:10,246
And the first one that
makes a move toward it,

1389
01:19:10,288 --> 01:19:12,540
that's the one we're after.

1390
01:19:15,626 --> 01:19:17,712
You're not afraid.

1391
01:19:17,754 --> 01:19:20,465
What makes you think I'm not?

1392
01:19:20,506 --> 01:19:22,133
I simply want
to tell all I know.

1393
01:19:22,175 --> 01:19:24,135
Well, that shouldn't
take very long.

1394
01:19:24,177 --> 01:19:25,678
Sit down.

1395
01:19:25,720 --> 01:19:27,388
Now cut out the stalling!

1396
01:19:27,430 --> 01:19:28,473
Who killed Gail Richards?

1397
01:19:28,514 --> 01:19:29,599
Pick 'em out.

1398
01:19:34,479 --> 01:19:36,359
In the first place the
one they wanted to kill

1399
01:19:36,383 --> 01:19:37,899
was Miss Carrington.

1400
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:39,942
Well never mind
who they were after.

1401
01:19:39,984 --> 01:19:40,919
Who done it?

1402
01:19:40,943 --> 01:19:45,114
The murderer didn't know
he killed the wrong girl.

1403
01:19:47,784 --> 01:19:50,536
When he found out he was
panicky and hid the body.

1404
01:19:50,578 --> 01:19:53,664
You see doctor, I did
not have hallucinations.

1405
01:19:53,706 --> 01:19:55,458
Fairly interesting.

1406
01:19:57,210 --> 01:19:59,050
Say what are you
watching that fireplace for?

1407
01:19:59,074 --> 01:20:00,963
Who do you expect, Santa Claus?

1408
01:20:01,005 --> 01:20:01,815
Come on!

1409
01:20:01,839 --> 01:20:03,508
Who done it?

1410
01:20:03,549 --> 01:20:05,092
The house keeper knew.

1411
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:09,305
She knew too much,
but she wasn't the one.

1412
01:20:09,347 --> 01:20:13,768
When she was about to
confess, she disappeared

1413
01:20:13,810 --> 01:20:16,354
from this very chair.

1414
01:20:16,395 --> 01:20:18,397
And the person who
caused her disappearance

1415
01:20:18,439 --> 01:20:20,233
was standing right
beside this fireplace

1416
01:20:20,274 --> 01:20:22,360
when it happened.

1417
01:20:22,401 --> 01:20:23,778
What do you say doc?

1418
01:20:23,820 --> 01:20:25,988
He's looking right
straight at you.

1419
01:20:26,030 --> 01:20:27,950
The man's mad, I was
nowhere near the fireplace

1420
01:20:27,974 --> 01:20:29,992
when it happened.

1421
01:20:30,034 --> 01:20:31,452
I was over there.

1422
01:20:33,246 --> 01:20:36,707
Rama, you were standing
here by the fireplace.

1423
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,292
You're mistaken Dr. Jeris.

1424
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:40,795
I was standing
by the library door.

1425
01:20:40,837 --> 01:20:42,380
Wait a minute.

1426
01:20:42,421 --> 01:20:44,090
Who was standing
by the fireplace

1427
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:45,967
when the house
keeper disappeared?

1428
01:20:46,008 --> 01:20:48,469
Why, Father, you were there.

1429
01:20:49,595 --> 01:20:52,765
Why yes, come
to think of it, I was.

1430
01:20:54,141 --> 01:20:59,063
Mr. Carrington, would you
mind sitting in that chair?

1431
01:20:59,105 --> 01:21:00,439
Of course not.

1432
01:21:20,251 --> 01:21:21,669
That's enough!

1433
01:21:21,711 --> 01:21:23,963
Get 'em up all of ya!

1434
01:21:24,005 --> 01:21:25,005
Get 'em up.

1435
01:21:30,196 --> 01:21:31,196
Get 'em up!

1436
01:21:31,220 --> 01:21:32,030
Father!

1437
01:21:32,054 --> 01:21:35,558
Nevermind that, put
your hands up too.

1438
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:38,811
And if you've got any sense,
you won't move a muscle.

1439
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:42,315
You see, I told you it was him.

1440
01:21:42,356 --> 01:21:44,191
Sergeant Roberts
it's been a pleasure

1441
01:21:44,233 --> 01:21:48,154
to do business with a
man of your intelligence.

1442
01:22:58,057 --> 01:23:01,394
Take your hands off that wheel!

1443
01:23:03,854 --> 01:23:05,231
Don't be a backseat driver.

1444
01:23:05,272 --> 01:23:06,272
Sit down.

1445
01:23:22,373 --> 01:23:24,125
That was a close one.

1446
01:23:37,031 --> 01:23:38,031
Hold tight!

1447
01:23:38,055 --> 01:23:39,473
Here we go again.

1448
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:03,682
Well it serves you right.

1449
01:25:03,724 --> 01:25:05,559
Oh, I'd hate to
be in your shoes.

1450
01:25:05,601 --> 01:25:08,062
First murder and
now reckless driving.

1451
01:25:08,104 --> 01:25:11,524
The recording angel'll
certainly throw the book at you!

1452
01:25:11,565 --> 01:25:13,734
Say, what are you doing here?

1453
01:25:13,776 --> 01:25:14,586
Oof!

1454
01:25:14,610 --> 01:25:16,195
- Steady old boy.
- I beg your pardon.

1455
01:25:16,237 --> 01:25:18,864
Now, why did you try
to kill your daughter?

1456
01:25:18,906 --> 01:25:20,366
Oh don't be silly.

1457
01:25:20,407 --> 01:25:21,909
I'm not Ann's father.

1458
01:25:21,951 --> 01:25:22,993
Who are you?

1459
01:25:23,035 --> 01:25:24,495
I'm Walter Harberg.

1460
01:25:24,537 --> 01:25:26,413
Carrington's partner.

1461
01:25:26,455 --> 01:25:28,374
Carrington was killed
in a mine cave in.

1462
01:25:28,415 --> 01:25:29,750
So that's it.

1463
01:25:29,792 --> 01:25:32,461
Why you ghost of a
double crossing crook.

1464
01:25:32,503 --> 01:25:33,963
Ann must know about this!

1465
01:25:34,004 --> 01:25:34,815
Too late now.

1466
01:25:34,839 --> 01:25:37,049
Oh no, we're stuck
here till she finds out.

1467
01:25:37,091 --> 01:25:38,509
And when she knows the truth,

1468
01:25:38,551 --> 01:25:41,345
I can go to heaven
and you can go to,

1469
01:25:41,387 --> 01:25:42,322
give me a pencil quick.

1470
01:25:42,346 --> 01:25:43,156
And a piece of paper.

1471
01:25:43,180 --> 01:25:45,766
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1472
01:25:46,725 --> 01:25:48,561
Take a letter.

1473
01:25:48,602 --> 01:25:51,856
Dear Ann, I am not
your father, period.

1474
01:26:06,537 --> 01:26:10,040
Well if he was looking for
an accident he sure found it.

1475
01:26:10,082 --> 01:26:12,122
This is gonna cost him his
driver's license you know

1476
01:26:12,146 --> 01:26:13,019
that don't you?

1477
01:26:13,043 --> 01:26:14,043
Come on.

1478
01:26:15,754 --> 01:26:18,924
Here Toppy, give this to Ann.

1479
01:26:23,470 --> 01:26:25,270
I'm sorry about your
father Miss Carrington.

1480
01:26:25,312 --> 01:26:26,832
Wait a minute, he
wasn't her father.

1481
01:26:26,856 --> 01:26:29,395
Miss Carrington this is for you.

1482
01:26:33,856 --> 01:26:35,107
Well what's this all about?

1483
01:26:35,149 --> 01:26:35,959
Well here, read it.

1484
01:26:35,983 --> 01:26:38,861
Or am I expecting too much?

1485
01:26:38,903 --> 01:26:40,196
Where did you get this note?

1486
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:42,156
It flew into my hand.

1487
01:26:44,074 --> 01:26:47,453
Notes that fly, fathers
that ain't fathers,

1488
01:26:47,494 --> 01:26:48,913
leaping chairs!

1489
01:26:48,954 --> 01:26:49,931
Come on let's get out of here

1490
01:26:49,955 --> 01:26:52,917
before the trees start talking!

1491
01:26:52,958 --> 01:26:54,251
Edward?

1492
01:26:54,293 --> 01:26:55,878
Edward where are you?

1493
01:26:55,920 --> 01:26:56,921
Here I am.

1494
01:26:59,567 --> 01:27:00,567
And here I go.

1495
01:27:00,591 --> 01:27:01,884
Edward come back here.

1496
01:27:01,926 --> 01:27:02,736
Not me.

1497
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:04,720
From now on I used
to be your chauffeur.

1498
01:27:04,762 --> 01:27:06,082
But you've gotta drive us home.

1499
01:27:06,106 --> 01:27:07,106
Not in that car.

1500
01:27:07,139 --> 01:27:11,852
Enough is enough and that's
what I've had a abundancy of!

1501
01:27:11,894 --> 01:27:13,938
Very well, if that's the
way you feel about it,

1502
01:27:13,979 --> 01:27:15,648
Emily will drive us.

1503
01:27:15,689 --> 01:27:18,609
And Cosmo, this
time I'll sit on your lap.

1504
01:27:18,651 --> 01:27:20,194
All right darling.

1505
01:27:20,236 --> 01:27:22,238
Emily do you know how to drive?

1506
01:27:22,279 --> 01:27:23,089
No ma'am.

1507
01:27:23,113 --> 01:27:24,531
Isn't it exciting?

1508
01:27:32,122 --> 01:27:36,001
Thanks Eddie, you've
been a great help.

1509
01:27:36,043 --> 01:27:39,964
Sorry I had to dump
you in the water old boy.
