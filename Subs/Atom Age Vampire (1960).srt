1
00:00:26,27 --> 00:00:27,81
Old.

2
00:01:12,38 --> 00:01:14,82
A who's.

3
00:01:30,41 --> 00:01:33,17
Up. I won't even.

4
00:01:38,97 --> 00:01:39,29
Try to get

5
00:01:39,30 --> 00:01:48,12
a three year hedge and I only came
in to tell you goodbye. Goodbye. I

6
00:01:48,13 --> 00:01:54,94
thought over. You had your choice. Either
me or the local profession you're working

7
00:01:54,95 --> 00:02:00,85
at you're still working let me. Oh please
don't take it like this that you know

8
00:02:00,86 --> 00:02:06,15
your ship is about to say that I brought
it here if I go away is either one or even

9
00:02:06,16 --> 00:02:11,77
more than we both have already you know we
belong to each other. And then the snow

10
00:02:11,77 --> 00:02:18,70
. Of all the people out there they

11
00:02:18,71 --> 00:02:21,55
want to do whatever now do
another number on the job.

12
00:03:07,30 --> 00:03:12,89
How. Will you know. And.

13
00:03:14,44 --> 00:03:21,36
What you might like to. Remind. Your days

14
00:03:21,38 --> 00:03:27,64
now. I could read the truth in
the eyes of the bit of hope.

15
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:36,86
Pick. You might as well be prepared
for the way but it won't make

16
00:03:36,87 --> 00:03:43,40
any difference from one who brought it up
I don't what it is but it would be by you

17
00:03:43,41 --> 00:03:43,63
know

18
00:03:44,13 --> 00:03:59,52
a little. She

19
00:03:59,53 --> 00:04:05,82
has no family not even friends because
of the worry about news that go to

20
00:04:06,53 --> 00:04:10,76
that anyone know you in the clinic no one
and no one must know that Jeanette Moreno

21
00:04:10,77 --> 00:04:17,33
is coming here. I have come the THANK YOU
ago and I know that actually exist you're

22
00:04:17,34 --> 00:04:19,24
going to need me I'll be here oh.

23
00:04:41,98 --> 00:04:48,38
You know why

24
00:04:48,39 --> 00:04:54,95
out who I bet

25
00:04:54,96 --> 00:05:00,18
you're going to hold out at the point.

26
00:05:01,23 --> 00:05:07,40
That one thousand eight

27
00:05:07,41 --> 00:05:12,34
thousand head south.

28
00:05:28,99 --> 00:05:34,27
No you mustn't give up all
hope yet who are you.

29
00:05:37,81 --> 00:05:42,52
Don't ask me questions there
isn't time I'm an assistant to

30
00:05:42,53 --> 00:05:45,82
a great scientist who has come to hear of
your case and wants to know more about

31
00:05:45,83 --> 00:05:52,59
you he wants to give you treatment but
the use of treatment what's the use you

32
00:05:52,60 --> 00:05:54,78
have to believe me we have discovered

33
00:05:54,79 --> 00:05:58,44
a new therapy together and it's
miraculous I guarantee it.

34
00:06:04,44 --> 00:06:08,29
A little earlier I buy now don't tell me
you're here because you want to interview

35
00:06:08,30 --> 00:06:12,18
me you don't think so then I would tell you
that did you read about that good what

36
00:06:12,19 --> 00:06:14,59
do you mean Och come
on what about this for

37
00:06:14,60 --> 00:06:18,08
a big headline Jeannette war I know I've
been beautiful as ever think I might

38
00:06:18,09 --> 00:06:21,29
publicity good clinic it sure but that's
one headline you are never going to see in

39
00:06:21,30 --> 00:06:27,78
print when that doctor waiting at the
address of the long right here on the speak

40
00:06:27,79 --> 00:06:32,01
with you. And I need absolutely

41
00:06:34,61 --> 00:06:35,32
not a word to

42
00:06:35,33 --> 00:06:42,89
a soul this is the only hope you
have keep that in mind always you

43
00:06:42,90 --> 00:06:48,10
will drop out of sight for short time real
for weeks at the very most and when you

44
00:06:48,11 --> 00:06:52,67
appear everything will be
before as to the week and from

45
00:06:52,68 --> 00:06:57,83
a horrible dream Don't you believe me

46
00:06:59,73 --> 00:07:06,37
well then do just as you wish
I have never been to see you

47
00:07:09,92 --> 00:07:11,08
really expecting you.

48
00:07:18,53 --> 00:07:25,41
Don't disappoint me. I'm not
being immodest when I speak of

49
00:07:25,42 --> 00:07:31,70
a whole new year in biology and. Destructive
and in general to the fact of atomic

50
00:07:31,71 --> 00:07:37,80
explosion and didn't find
more than ever before in. The

51
00:07:37,81 --> 00:07:41,70
regeneration rebuilding
abnormal or totally destroyed.

52
00:07:45,75 --> 00:07:51,53
In correcting at normal growth as well as
storing which have been destroyed often

53
00:07:51,54 --> 00:07:55,99
grows out of there are twenty eight has
grown out of Burma twenty five the serum

54
00:07:56,00 --> 00:08:00,66
which provoked an exhilarating not normal
development. When I finally succeeded in

55
00:08:00,67 --> 00:08:05,08
stabilizing effect I produced the ant account
in the bank scene which for years had

56
00:08:05,09 --> 00:08:11,91
been the major goal of the most.
Repeated experiment using

57
00:08:11,92 --> 00:08:15,73
Dharma twenty eight on specimens deformed
by injections of Norman twenty five

58
00:08:16,00 --> 00:08:20,46
proved regular. Single and
there were twenty eight.

59
00:08:25,54 --> 00:08:29,38
What are you doing don't you realize that
you must be completely insane yet the

60
00:08:29,39 --> 00:08:32,97
drama twenty five that we've been injecting
in so many of those political control

61
00:08:32,98 --> 00:08:38,42
make them into monsters you're aware of
its effect that come on you have to be

62
00:08:38,43 --> 00:08:42,10
exposed to treatment up front in the
radiation chambre No give me an injection

63
00:08:42,11 --> 00:08:45,36
after twenty eight you know it's never
been tried in human beings I would never

64
00:08:45,37 --> 00:08:49,31
cover it that's just why I did it to push
the current No that's right for the girls

65
00:08:49,32 --> 00:08:54,35
and that Maureen I know I want to share
this on with you. Before as I have at this

66
00:08:54,36 --> 00:08:59,43
moment and you will always
remember if we don't need you.

67
00:09:01,35 --> 00:09:04,71
Don't be troubled about me but
it's all we could bring so.

68
00:09:11,47 --> 00:09:16,32
Quickly every second we have especially.
During the twenty eight represents months

69
00:09:16,33 --> 00:09:19,87
of work and anxiety and when the day comes
when we can prepare it is rapidly as we

70
00:09:19,88 --> 00:09:21,14
do drama twenty five Give me

71
00:09:21,15 --> 00:09:28,11
a. Yes no doubt it's not the strike to

72
00:09:28,12 --> 00:09:34,36
start. It removes every trace of
the generation of cell structure.

73
00:09:35,91 --> 00:09:37,39
The day to come but once in

74
00:09:37,40 --> 00:09:43,96
a lifetime that is our life that's right

75
00:09:45,78 --> 00:09:50,80
I shall always remember everything you've
done for me thank you tell me that in

76
00:09:50,81 --> 00:09:56,18
some other way tell it
to. The kind of right.

77
00:09:58,70 --> 00:10:01,48
They hold together with our record.

78
00:10:24,69 --> 00:10:30,43
You look at me that right. There you seem
to be performing some sacred ritual.

79
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,85
If you want to return.

80
00:10:52,79 --> 00:10:53,50
This profession that.

81
00:11:11,83 --> 00:11:12,35
You have come to

82
00:11:12,36 --> 00:11:18,99
a I'm happy to see you and your luggage
in the check room at the station as you

83
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,72
instructed with the ticket.

84
00:11:27,55 --> 00:11:32,78
Are you sure that no one knows you
come here. Go and pick up your luggage

85
00:11:35,99 --> 00:11:42,48
that's going to the party.
But this isn't like

86
00:11:42,49 --> 00:11:44,37
a clinic. Not

87
00:11:44,38 --> 00:11:48,27
a clinic it's the place where Dr Levin
studies and does his work with me to help

88
00:11:48,28 --> 00:11:48,36
him.

89
00:12:04,40 --> 00:12:04,81
Show me

90
00:12:04,82 --> 00:12:13,19
a face show

91
00:12:13,20 --> 00:12:13,34
me

92
00:12:13,35 --> 00:12:35,69
a face have. No

93
00:12:35,70 --> 00:12:42,48
doubt to be. Disfigured forever
as if I can say that's beyond

94
00:12:42,49 --> 00:12:49,17
control like leprosy. Is the
one who can help. Me go away.

95
00:12:58,73 --> 00:13:03,80
I give you my word that I will restore
your faith restore all you if you think it

96
00:13:03,81 --> 00:13:10,29
was done all the other because you want
to defeat. The public like that put

97
00:13:10,30 --> 00:13:13,39
yourself together we have
succeeded in discovering

98
00:13:13,40 --> 00:13:18,61
a great secret secret of spontaneous
reproduction of living he could like the

99
00:13:19,49 --> 00:13:25,88
secret of life and also of death just not
I deliberately spoke of cancer cells

100
00:13:25,89 --> 00:13:29,11
which proliferate unexpectedly at the
expense of the all going to them until they

101
00:13:29,12 --> 00:13:33,33
have destroyed over this remarkable
discovery we have succeeded in creating

102
00:13:33,34 --> 00:13:38,02
spontaneous reproduction of we can rebuild
those which have been destroyed we have

103
00:13:38,03 --> 00:13:42,98
paid the months that were drunk devoured
us and made it serve all our own and you

104
00:13:42,99 --> 00:13:44,16
must know it's

105
00:13:44,17 --> 00:13:48,47
a miracle and you will be the first person
in the world to benefit from it I shall

106
00:13:48,48 --> 00:13:53,78
perform this miracle. To believe
that I didn't forgot not

107
00:13:53,79 --> 00:13:57,14
a great speech that me go
now rather than go on I.

108
00:14:07,92 --> 00:14:14,88
Preferred it to yourself.
That if you've given up all

109
00:14:14,89 --> 00:14:18,53
hope Why didn't you do it before that you
have condemned for the rest of your life

110
00:14:19,08 --> 00:14:25,84
and you know you know they all
told you that. Right now.

111
00:14:29,91 --> 00:14:36,91
If you really are so desperate to take
your own life if you want to. Give this

112
00:14:36,92 --> 00:14:40,36
back to you. I don't know on that day when
you look me in the face and tell me that

113
00:14:40,37 --> 00:14:47,31
I paid you do you understand Jeanette
I don't till that day come. We

114
00:14:47,32 --> 00:14:51,64
do pride. I beg you.

115
00:14:56,79 --> 00:15:01,21
Do you think I had

116
00:15:01,22 --> 00:15:07,39
a room prepared oh. And now
we must pick up Stan She's

117
00:15:07,40 --> 00:15:12,28
a beautiful human specimen you to fool.

118
00:15:15,70 --> 00:15:22,69
About oh I didn't hear anything
about the we just sailed but you

119
00:15:22,70 --> 00:15:26,09
mean today she had all her belongings
collected from the hotel tour and had them

120
00:15:26,10 --> 00:15:31,10
delivered here at the clinic toward the
on the. You told that you were going back

121
00:15:31,11 --> 00:15:31,29
without

122
00:15:31,30 --> 00:15:35,43
a problem to tell you what she did with
him to talk to Jeanette must still be in

123
00:15:35,44 --> 00:15:41,85
town I mean she's gone away they're
going to be running the news

124
00:15:42,71 --> 00:15:47,27
at the next I'll have to between Janet what
I know didn't want you to again and she

125
00:15:47,27 --> 00:15:47,27
.

126
00:16:11,13 --> 00:16:11,35
Read.

127
00:17:42,97 --> 00:17:44,47
In.

128
00:18:26,72 --> 00:18:28,74
Who's to.

129
00:18:36,18 --> 00:18:38,07
Talking of and then thank you very much.

130
00:18:54,44 --> 00:18:58,69
All right are you going
back to the cinema for

131
00:18:58,70 --> 00:19:01,19
a person disappear
overnight without leaving

132
00:19:01,20 --> 00:19:07,94
a trace. But it won't help the

133
00:19:07,95 --> 00:19:11,24
Scotch I don't weigh the prizes on June.

134
00:19:18,16 --> 00:19:21,20
Eighth. Eight.

135
00:19:26,24 --> 00:19:28,83
The Democrats never mind when Gump.

136
00:20:03,45 --> 00:20:04,25
Has no effect.

137
00:20:30,33 --> 00:20:37,15
On the reasons. That I.

138
00:20:43,01 --> 00:20:47,25
Used to. Help you.

139
00:20:52,11 --> 00:20:52,63
Much to.

140
00:20:59,03 --> 00:20:59,29
Give you

141
00:20:59,30 --> 00:21:05,97
a lift to might. Not

142
00:21:05,98 --> 00:21:10,16
a drop of the serum next five injections
without any effect at all and I know I was

143
00:21:10,17 --> 00:21:13,92
not mistaken that took effect on you because
then you applied it immediately in the

144
00:21:13,93 --> 00:21:17,83
case of pills to destroy you will have
to be continued complication perhaps to

145
00:21:17,84 --> 00:21:23,02
correct but it will take months to prepare
serum enough. Sandra we will find

146
00:21:23,03 --> 00:21:25,84
another subject when we can use the
plight of the twenty and never go around

147
00:21:25,85 --> 00:21:31,29
telling everyone what we did we left to
kill and besides what if the demo to date

148
00:21:31,30 --> 00:21:32,57
should have some unusual effect on

149
00:21:32,58 --> 00:21:37,07
a don't forget we derived from down the
twenty five I can't bear to think of her

150
00:21:37,08 --> 00:21:37,46
becoming

151
00:21:37,47 --> 00:21:49,02
a monster is that it you worry
too much about her. Thank

152
00:21:49,02 --> 00:21:49,02
.

153
00:22:01,60 --> 00:22:04,85
You.

154
00:22:15,98 --> 00:22:17,75
You think I never had

155
00:22:17,76 --> 00:22:57,43
a moment. If you don't mind. A

156
00:22:57,44 --> 00:23:02,80
big. Stick up there.

157
00:23:35,41 --> 00:23:35,54
And

158
00:23:35,55 --> 00:23:38,72
a sticker shock is completely over and it
can't be any more thought of that we've

159
00:23:38,73 --> 00:23:45,71
won. Yeah. That's right at the moment

160
00:23:45,72 --> 00:23:46,36
all I'm able to.

161
00:23:52,62 --> 00:23:58,78
What the after effects now with the
regeneration of sound continue as the truth I'm

162
00:23:58,79 --> 00:24:04,60
sure it will. To.

163
00:24:08,47 --> 00:24:12,14
You yes you know it's purpose
and I think that I'm with.

164
00:24:27,26 --> 00:24:28,21
You.

165
00:24:31,46 --> 00:24:38,43
You know when

166
00:24:38,44 --> 00:24:44,62
you. When

167
00:24:45,44 --> 00:24:50,83
you. Lose.

168
00:24:54,66 --> 00:24:57,50
I know you more than my
life it's the Senate

169
00:25:02,88 --> 00:25:09,34
that second that you have suffered great
physical shock with all that you've

170
00:25:09,35 --> 00:25:11,10
recovered yet but we must wait

171
00:25:11,11 --> 00:25:19,36
a bit we must be certain what
the results are absolutely

172
00:25:19,37 --> 00:25:26,25
sure don't Dr Janet miracle
has happened to you

173
00:25:29,82 --> 00:25:33,79
and you will remain with us and Kubiak
sure that we can proclaim it to the entire

174
00:25:33,80 --> 00:25:34,28
all were.

175
00:25:53,24 --> 00:25:59,87
Another. One. Don't you feel happy and
you want to laugh and sing of joy.

176
00:26:07,35 --> 00:26:13,52
And money. I wonder what young. You
had an experiment is going on.

177
00:26:14,89 --> 00:26:16,24
Anyways like this.

178
00:26:53,84 --> 00:26:54,58
Do you want here.

179
00:27:01,29 --> 00:27:07,26
You embraced me when you first saw that
you were cured then gratitude is already

180
00:27:07,27 --> 00:27:11,50
become. You shouldn't believe that if
I love you I would surely tell you.

181
00:27:17,22 --> 00:27:23,09
That. You weren't able to see clearly in
your heart and you're still too upset by

182
00:27:23,10 --> 00:27:29,80
everything that has happened. You
must know you love me I have

183
00:27:29,81 --> 00:27:34,62
snatched you away from desperation and from
there it is I who restored your beauty

184
00:27:34,98 --> 00:27:38,22
it is I who need you never be able.

185
00:27:51,79 --> 00:27:55,79
To nothing if not. To me.

186
00:28:06,64 --> 00:28:06,82
Wait

187
00:28:06,83 --> 00:28:16,16
a moment I'd almost forgotten
excuse me one moment. Tell

188
00:28:16,17 --> 00:28:22,38
me what it did nothing nothing at all
something rather original which I forgot him

189
00:28:22,39 --> 00:28:26,75
when he. Was

190
00:28:26,76 --> 00:28:35,81
a wonder. I

191
00:28:35,82 --> 00:28:39,95
don't know what's wrong it's just
so much Bayfront fire down here

192
00:28:39,96 --> 00:28:43,91
a moment. You'll be all right

193
00:28:49,28 --> 00:28:52,61
Monique I don't understand.

194
00:28:57,64 --> 00:29:03,13
What's wrong with me I'm
here should just relax

195
00:29:04,95 --> 00:29:11,73
you're very tired now she was sleep soundly
for several hours time is pressing over

196
00:29:11,74 --> 00:29:15,47
to the laboratory at once it must be

197
00:29:15,48 --> 00:29:22,23
a success Afghanistan don't count any
longer on the money she means what you know

198
00:29:22,24 --> 00:29:28,79
than just an experiment. I cannot
do it without you then I'll make

199
00:29:28,80 --> 00:29:33,68
a condition you know what it is yes never
see her again I give you my word Believe

200
00:29:33,69 --> 00:29:40,61
me I shall help us

201
00:29:40,62 --> 00:29:41,74
carry her to the laboratory

202
00:29:53,57 --> 00:29:56,71
I prepared everything but what's
to be done back if there were only

203
00:29:56,72 --> 00:30:01,60
a single drop of it still next but there
isn't any I refuse to give up and I'll try

204
00:30:01,61 --> 00:30:08,45
radiation. And you've gone mad I know
it's madness and I'm going to take

205
00:30:08,46 --> 00:30:12,08
any risk you know very well that this
just got this with palming again and

206
00:30:12,09 --> 00:30:15,79
radioactive treatment is effective only
gets down to twenty five and that.

207
00:30:19,49 --> 00:30:26,13
She mustn't suffer like this. There's
always surgery and insertion you're out of.

208
00:30:27,44 --> 00:30:31,39
The only possible solution transplant
directly from another human being those plans

209
00:30:31,40 --> 00:30:33,53
with produce number twenty
eight from another woman

210
00:30:33,54 --> 00:30:38,77
a young one out there has been saying you
cannot open her I give you my childhood

211
00:30:38,88 --> 00:30:42,58
now I know that I can trust you how would
you accomplish it by marrying the first

212
00:30:42,59 --> 00:30:47,44
woman that passes the picture look different
look at another woman another does the

213
00:30:47,45 --> 00:30:51,70
best but if that's going
to. Come back yeah.

214
00:31:03,36 --> 00:31:07,82
To me on a topic we've already said enough
to each other she's lying down there

215
00:31:07,83 --> 00:31:12,99
a lot not possible to taper What can we do
I am still here and tell you what do you

216
00:31:13,00 --> 00:31:16,00
want to be sacrificed myself possible.

217
00:31:23,42 --> 00:31:27,34
To. I mean that you know but it will pass.

218
00:31:30,97 --> 00:31:35,57
Not love really intimidated going to
compulsion if you like I want to dominate the

219
00:31:35,58 --> 00:31:40,100
girl the possessor created. This also
helped me overcome this and that you may

220
00:31:41,47 --> 00:31:48,40
struggle along with me as you
always have done. Yet you

221
00:31:48,41 --> 00:31:52,24
manage to convince yourself doing
things like this like this.

222
00:31:58,91 --> 00:32:04,50
Has nothing to do with the
two of us. I promise you and

223
00:32:04,51 --> 00:32:11,50
a far away. Way. I will forgive. Start all

224
00:32:11,51 --> 00:32:15,05
over again and be successful Please try
to be the same intelligent woman you've

225
00:32:15,06 --> 00:32:18,11
always been. And I would kill

226
00:32:18,12 --> 00:32:28,32
a thousand times probably to defeat. The

227
00:32:28,33 --> 00:32:28,89
reasonable.

228
00:32:37,68 --> 00:32:44,11
You. Know that we are bound together or.

229
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,65
You.

230
00:33:08,55 --> 00:33:10,15
At least commission the Bush effort that's

231
00:33:10,16 --> 00:33:15,25
a lesson that you haven't met before that
your name is sell well no photographs do

232
00:33:15,26 --> 00:33:19,31
a television interview. Apologise not

233
00:33:19,32 --> 00:33:23,87
a my assistant I'm sorry we had the deputy
personally the way you did telephone is

234
00:33:23,88 --> 00:33:29,60
the I'm all alone here at the moment. Good
grief I'm out of cigarettes do you mind

235
00:33:29,61 --> 00:33:32,09
if I get if you go half
an hour without smoking

236
00:33:42,36 --> 00:33:48,24
why does it not sure why did you come
in without knocking on that door

237
00:33:53,37 --> 00:33:58,10
professor that and send you. Have

238
00:33:58,11 --> 00:34:02,87
a date Oh yes champagne

239
00:34:05,10 --> 00:34:05,78

240
00:34:17,01 --> 00:34:17,62
What do you mean.

241
00:34:24,36 --> 00:34:30,55
Oh no not. By the good. Name.

242
00:34:39,04 --> 00:34:43,63
And showed no symptom warning
before hand oh yeah I've kept on

243
00:34:43,64 --> 00:34:49,54
a special for almost two years. Make up
of the difficult ones without an autopsy

244
00:34:49,97 --> 00:34:56,46
autopsy I've already confirmed the
diagnosis. Out of consideration I don't know

245
00:34:57,21 --> 00:34:57,70
if it is

246
00:34:57,71 --> 00:35:04,11
a practice. If the decision lies within my
jurisdiction I say no autopsy if one is

247
00:35:04,58 --> 00:35:10,31
absolutely not she was from.

248
00:35:14,00 --> 00:35:18,98
You will find her identity card in papers
in her room she suffered from and the

249
00:35:18,99 --> 00:35:21,53
patient. Should show you something.

250
00:35:27,89 --> 00:35:31,27
This is the most recent electrocardiogram
I get that she wouldn't find

251
00:35:31,28 --> 00:35:38,07
a better show this things are
pathologist but the Chinese you know

252
00:35:38,08 --> 00:35:44,80
Professor I'd say I know you intimately
that amaze you well it doesn't take

253
00:35:44,81 --> 00:35:45,91
a long white there to be

254
00:35:45,92 --> 00:35:50,48
a scientist. But I know your articles I've
read your interviews and I saw you want

255
00:35:50,49 --> 00:35:56,15
television when you returned from Japan
Oh by the way strange looking bottles are

256
00:35:56,16 --> 00:35:57,62
they from Hiroshima

257
00:35:57,72 --> 00:36:01,90
a process of the formative fusion of
bottle glasses Remick near each other the

258
00:36:01,90 --> 00:36:05,34
people here will see most of
them a souvenir Well anyway it's

259
00:36:05,35 --> 00:36:08,01
a rather shocking sight
and that you remain

260
00:36:08,02 --> 00:36:12,41
a long time the. Right month at

261
00:36:12,48 --> 00:36:16,89
a Japanese Institute for Radiological
Research Oh how interesting.

262
00:36:19,74 --> 00:36:23,02
Thank you I gave up smoking then you had

263
00:36:23,03 --> 00:36:29,92
a close look at those poor creatures. And
from then on I've devoted my life what

264
00:36:29,93 --> 00:36:32,79
research exactly. Are you acquainted with.

265
00:36:37,10 --> 00:36:38,40
That after the atomic explosion.

266
00:36:46,87 --> 00:36:52,91
What extraordinary development. What
you mean. By extracting at the.

267
00:37:00,45 --> 00:37:03,10
During your television. Shows.

268
00:37:26,37 --> 00:37:26,50
Like

269
00:37:26,51 --> 00:37:36,37
a logical. Relationship between. A

270
00:37:36,38 --> 00:37:36,79
problem.

271
00:37:44,25 --> 00:37:45,05
Well then Dr.

272
00:38:36,00 --> 00:38:36,25

276
00:39:24,17 --> 00:39:27,57
home I would do what he
did put them on. Blast.

277
00:39:49,35 --> 00:39:50,25
And then there's

278
00:39:50,26 --> 00:39:53,32
a room you will wake up for several
hours and I want you to watch outside

279
00:39:53,33 --> 00:39:56,26
a door and that's when you see
me put this stuff come around.

283
00:40:24,09 --> 00:40:29,38
to look at everyone now if

284
00:40:31,53 --> 00:40:36,65
All the while. You're

285
00:40:36,66 --> 00:42:49,20

286
00:42:49,21 --> 00:42:51,32

287
00:43:08,65 --> 00:43:10,31
Why.

00:43:37,12 --> 00:43:39,40
Oh.

00:44:04,16 --> 00:44:04,78
You.

290
00:44:43,23 --> 00:44:43,50
Think.

291
00:44:50,71 --> 00:44:57,70
Without the. I know you think. You're
afraid that you will not be permanent

292
00:44:58,64 --> 00:45:04,33
but you're mistaken outgrown the question
of growth I've already called the problem

293
00:45:05,87 --> 00:45:09,95
the must allow the self be regenerated
to achieve lasting ability now or some

294
00:45:09,96 --> 00:45:14,23
artificially for a time
and especially with

295
00:45:14,24 --> 00:45:18,47
a transfer. And it must
be done more than once

296
00:45:21,75 --> 00:45:26,56
why are you staring at I told you I'm
tired and up that I spent the whole night

297
00:45:26,57 --> 00:45:30,90
rotting in the laboratory so you could
wake up as you walk. How many more times

298
00:45:30,94 --> 00:45:32,57
would you have to tweet

299
00:45:33,08 --> 00:45:38,56

realize how deeply you should I have.

No doubt about it and this one showing the
card was given to me at the clinic and I

338
00:54:35,44 --> 00:54:41,29
waited but your brother had yet or
rather the same girl I agree. But I was

339
00:54:41,30 --> 00:54:47,49
referring to the person you met tonight.
Don't think Bono commissioner it was she

340
00:54:47,50 --> 00:54:54,42
in front of me but in the dark
with the problem and. What I know

341
00:54:54,43 --> 00:55:00,64
or I couldn't possibly be mistaken. Listed
with the Bureau of myth and she's not

342
00:55:00,65 --> 00:55:04,100
a missing person she's here I've seen or
she has no relatives in town you know

343
00:55:05,01 --> 00:55:08,80
she'd been kidnapped listen you know I
want to believe you I remember the auto

344
00:55:08,81 --> 00:55:13,44
accident which in that Moreno barely
escaped with a life but this story of

345
00:55:13,45 --> 00:55:19,13
a recovery is impossible yet she's cured
perfectly normal same fate but who would

346
00:55:19,14 --> 00:55:20,17
be likely to hide to do

347
00:55:20,18 --> 00:55:26,91
a miracle is that whoever it was it
tried to kill me. An hour ago and rude

348
00:55:26,92 --> 00:55:30,76
automate police sergeant Rondo recovers
from an automobile This is the license

349
00:55:30,77 --> 00:55:34,80
number you want to rejuvenate me how
long has it been since I bought it about

350
00:55:34,81 --> 00:55:39,00
stolen car the same automobile or short
time before just about the same moment the

351
00:55:39,01 --> 00:55:42,65
assault occurred with spot for speeding
on the esplanade work past the waterfront

352
00:55:42,66 --> 00:55:46,32
by patrolman shellacked inside as well as
the driver there was an unconscious woman

353
00:55:46,33 --> 00:55:46,45
and

354
00:55:46,46 --> 00:55:50,96
a doctor taking her to the hospital you see
that the hospital I was already telephoned

355
00:55:50,97 --> 00:55:52,83
there's no record of or
maybe I was taking it to

356
00:55:52,84 --> 00:55:57,98
a private clinic the name of the doctor.
Didn't bother asking that under the

357
00:55:57,99 --> 00:56:01,52
circumstances it could have been a doctor
coming to the first automobile he found

358
00:56:02,39 --> 00:56:07,04
a clever criminal who would say anything
to avoid identifying themselves or the

359
00:56:07,04 --> 00:56:12,46
woman. But there happened to be

360
00:56:12,47 --> 00:56:16,02
a real doctor who might give us some
information about this miraculous recovery

361
00:56:19,70 --> 00:56:23,83
that may come with you yet but I want
condition however that no thank you in the

362
00:56:23,84 --> 00:56:24,12
car.

363
00:56:36,56 --> 00:56:43,56
Good evening Professor Levin excuses if
we're. This is police sergeant Durand.

364
00:56:44,59 --> 00:56:48,19
I think you already know excuse the
interruption if we disturbing you at this hour

365
00:56:48,20 --> 00:56:51,84
but passing in front of you also I thought
why don't I leave it up to you Professor

366
00:56:51,85 --> 00:56:52,66
level to clarify

367
00:56:52,67 --> 00:56:56,59
a scientific problem we had you were so
extremely kind in the when we met each

368
00:56:56,60 --> 00:57:02,68
other that time before in those unfortunate
circumstance. And that's the way

369
00:57:03,60 --> 00:57:06,80
when he created. You may go Sasha.

370
00:57:12,85 --> 00:57:14,58
Sasha He's

371
00:57:14,59 --> 00:57:21,42
a strange one. For the garden more than
anything. The soul of fidelity an expert

372
00:57:21,43 --> 00:57:23,76
with flowers the classic one to suspect in

373
00:57:23,77 --> 00:57:27,29
a mystery story if there were
anything to suspect him of offer you

374
00:57:27,30 --> 00:57:32,49
a drink in fact yes yes let's be comfortable
You must try to make it easy for with

375
00:57:32,50 --> 00:57:38,41
us eleven to forget that we're policeman
you notice the bottom got them as

376
00:57:38,43 --> 00:57:41,41
a souvenir of Hiroshima
interesting aren't they do or.

377
00:57:45,40 --> 00:57:47,74
Don't have to blow smoke
on them I know excuse me.

378
00:57:57,98 --> 00:58:03,26
Thank you if you please.

379
00:58:08,45 --> 00:58:13,61
Not expected. I'll make it brief look
here Professor if you've been following

380
00:58:13,62 --> 00:58:19,79
a class well that's on the right about Doc
not coming right in the right word for

381
00:58:19,80 --> 00:58:26,45
it sensational journalism Jane. Go
up in smoke if you don't mind it but

382
00:58:27,20 --> 00:58:30,63
I still don't comprehend the
time before I asked you

383
00:58:30,64 --> 00:58:34,44
a question which you were kind enough
to say was intelligent about the

384
00:58:34,45 --> 00:58:39,34
psychological reaction of the victims of
an atomic explosion Well then perhaps my

385
00:58:39,35 --> 00:58:42,90
own supposition will be an absurd one but
think of the ships that arrive here from

386
00:58:42,91 --> 00:58:49,83
Japan and this dock is it possible
that he's one of those. You're

387
00:58:49,84 --> 00:58:53,18
going to be pressed by the recurring factor
in these cases of the wound from the

388
00:58:53,19 --> 00:58:57,03
throat to the start of the obsession of
the vindictive minded men who has been

389
00:58:57,04 --> 00:59:01,59
poisoned the disfigured forever by
atomic radiation I might even say that

390
00:59:01,60 --> 00:59:03,76
a pair of the atom made you want to become

391
00:59:03,77 --> 00:59:08,25
a Exactly what do you say hypothesis
another dramatic but not to be excluded.

392
00:59:14,12 --> 00:59:17,81
You just said the hypothesis is melodramatic
but the fact that you don't exclude it

393
00:59:17,82 --> 00:59:22,09
altogether puts me how shall I say more at
peace with my own conscience we mustn't

394
00:59:22,10 --> 00:59:28,71
let off get too far off the ground the
photograph. Right excuse me I had another

395
00:59:28,72 --> 00:59:35,41
purpose in coming here to see you look
here examine these two photos you believe

396
00:59:35,41 --> 00:59:35,55
that

397
00:59:35,55 --> 00:59:41,88
a woman would do such as this might recover
altogether but I mean is without any

398
00:59:41,89 --> 00:59:42,66
scar without

399
00:59:42,67 --> 00:59:49,33
a trace I should think. That the

400
00:59:49,41 --> 00:59:54,44
duration is permanent nevertheless Professor
Wright made or the talking to write

401
00:59:56,39 --> 01:00:00,06
Nevertheless there is someone who swears
that he seen this woman the way she was

402
01:00:00,94 --> 01:00:03,42
that's impossible and if that did exist

403
01:00:03,43 --> 01:00:07,20
a cure I don't know what process we never
any men who had discovered one would be

404
01:00:07,21 --> 01:00:14,11
a celebrity and I assure you I'd be the
first Indian. Magine All right then this

405
01:00:14,13 --> 01:00:18,15
other photo which was submitted to me as
proof of her actual recovery must have

406
01:00:18,16 --> 01:00:24,29
been taken to some time
prior to her accident if

407
01:00:25,09 --> 01:00:31,64
the signature was not dated. Right and
besides even if it had been it could easily

408
01:00:31,65 --> 01:00:31,89
have been

409
01:00:32,04 --> 01:00:37,69
a professor I'm ready to swear that they
are on we've been disturbing you long

410
01:00:37,70 --> 01:00:43,56
enough most grateful Professor
accompany you all right relieving.

411
01:00:59,47 --> 01:01:03,91
You must feel about the
lonely here. You have

412
01:01:03,92 --> 01:01:08,16
a new assistant think it's so simple
to find one and moreover I am enjoying

413
01:01:08,17 --> 01:01:12,53
a period of repose right now I merely study
for relaxation you know Professor what

414
01:01:12,54 --> 01:01:14,79
I envy you with your gardener Sasha really

415
01:01:14,80 --> 01:01:16,90
a bit difficult to believe
that no it's just that I'm

01:01:16,91 --> 01:01:22,18
a flower garden on my days off imagine
inspector even worse at night maybe I know

417
01:01:22,19 --> 01:01:23,88
what you mean by dying to have

418
01:01:23,89 --> 01:01:29,20

car. Why don't you come to

What is the purpose of this autopsy now
doctor I've already arranged for the body

428
01:02:50,27 --> 01:02:55,22
to be exhumed I must ask you to proceed
without any for the argument that the money

429
01:02:55,33 --> 01:03:00,88
went on. I want my car at the door
in ten minutes Good morning doctor.

430
01:03:04,80 --> 01:03:04,99
I want

431
01:03:05,00 --> 01:03:12,27
a cigarette you. Have just had an idea

432
01:03:12,92 --> 01:03:17,21
I want you to keep that Villar progress
alive and under observation I think that

433
01:03:17,56 --> 01:03:20,51

434
01:03:34,82 --> 01:03:35,42

438
01:04:03,65 --> 01:04:06,88

I'm going to save you not when spite of

439
01:04:06,89 --> 01:04:11,08

returning embryonic still and old but

441
01:04:16,87 --> 01:04:20,59
invisible I think this action is not the
written almost immediately you will turn

442
01:04:20,60 --> 01:04:25,15
into just what you wrote before. Nothing
will get worse it will devour you.

443
01:04:26,53 --> 01:04:27,94
Transform you into an animal like

444
01:04:27,95 --> 01:04:32,51

your parents the game I don't want.

445
01:04:36,30 --> 01:04:39,00
I give you my word of
honor it would only take

446
01:04:39,01 --> 01:04:43,85
a few days perhaps only one day to make
the final occupation and then you will be

447
01:04:43,86 --> 01:04:48,36
cured forever Prita go where you please
and with whom you please if you run great

448
01:04:48,37 --> 01:04:49,33
for enough to leave me for

449
01:04:49,34 --> 01:04:54,45
a man who has done nothing for you you
deserve nothing else but until you're cured

450
01:04:54,85 --> 01:05:00,17
don't try any want to run away don't
try to see anyone you promise.

451
01:05:04,42 --> 01:05:08,30
I'll even give this back to you you
have no more reason to kill yourself.

452
01:05:16,90 --> 01:05:21,91
What is it. Really.

453
01:05:24,67 --> 01:05:28,99
Care. Who she had.

454
01:05:43,94 --> 01:05:50,40
Better go. Run to him let
him see you like this

455
01:05:51,97 --> 01:05:57,73
go away with him as you are. Remember I
give you my word and I shall keep it it

456
01:05:57,74 --> 01:06:04,34
will be your decision then in the
meantime you will help me to finish it

457
01:06:05,26 --> 01:06:10,72
it is not how bad it was speaking now but
Professor Levin. I have to when you see

458
01:06:11,73 --> 01:06:13,17
this is all I'm asking of you.

459
01:06:35,91 --> 01:06:41,52
You want to use Arjan I'm sorry to disturb
you why you started this different part

460
01:06:41,53 --> 01:06:45,03
of your profession I'm not really

461
01:06:45,04 --> 01:06:49,65
a policeman. And explain why
you did pass itself up as

462
01:06:49,66 --> 01:06:53,18
a policeman and for what reason the
commission I was the last just to learn more

463
01:06:53,19 --> 01:06:56,28
about your research but I asked permission
to come with him but on the other hand

464
01:06:56,29 --> 01:07:03,15
coming here so late at night and
not having time explaining what

465
01:07:03,16 --> 01:07:05,29
should you have said that you had

466
01:07:05,30 --> 01:07:08,99
a personal interest in the case of that
unfortunate young lady what is the name

467
01:07:08,100 --> 01:07:14,68
again. You know you're
not very convincing as

468
01:07:14,69 --> 01:07:21,31
a police. I guess I wasn't your
representative through the photo

469
01:07:21,55 --> 01:07:27,100
Jeanette with the signature was retaken
before the accident. But I know I've seen

470
01:07:28,01 --> 01:07:32,81
it I know it was she she just
met yesterday in front of me.

471
01:07:41,60 --> 01:07:45,30
And if they hadn't attacked me right then
you were attacked yes and from behind

472
01:07:46,40 --> 01:07:49,88
because I know there's some mystery concerning
Jeanette and I was about to learn it

473
01:07:50,63 --> 01:07:55,00
you love her that is evident I wonder if
you had parted with her sentiments of the

474
01:07:55,01 --> 01:07:59,78
I mean before you were actually separated
How did you know that I'm also psychotic

475
01:07:59,78 --> 01:08:06,64
. You're not suffering from an
obsession to find her again capable of

476
01:08:06,65 --> 01:08:11,18
seeing her in every woman you run into
and perhaps yesterday on that very same

477
01:08:11,19 --> 01:08:13,27
field where often before
Jeanette was waiting after

478
01:08:13,28 --> 01:08:19,13
a long voyage No it was no IT WAS THE NATION.
And how can you explain the attack on

479
01:08:19,14 --> 01:08:26,11
me well maybe an attempted
robbery. It wouldn't be the first

480
01:08:26,12 --> 01:08:32,51
time on the waterfront. And perhaps the
night was. Perhaps you'd also been drinking

481
01:08:32,52 --> 01:08:39,12
it you know I wasn't drinking.

482
01:08:44,25 --> 01:08:48,90
Will you please tell me what you wanted me
to do for you please help me to convince

483
01:08:48,91 --> 01:08:52,76
the police tell them that this miraculous
recovery is possible they will go on

484
01:08:52,77 --> 01:08:54,36
looking for and for

485
01:08:54,37 --> 01:09:00,60
a woman not to find them that's to be
excluded. Me to give up every hope your

486
01:09:00,61 --> 01:09:07,48
position. I would say yes. I
love her too much for that.

487
01:09:14,29 --> 01:09:18,45
Entirely different woman. No longer.

488
01:09:23,00 --> 01:09:29,92
I see there's nothing I can do. Thank you

489
01:09:30,19 --> 01:09:32,26
no no no need to thank you.

490
01:09:38,47 --> 01:09:44,19
Accompanied. By Mr. No.

491
01:09:46,66 --> 01:09:49,04
I don't think I'll be any
further occasions that.

492
01:10:30,37 --> 01:10:36,98
You have to do with. I didn't do it because
you didn't. Know that I could rely.

493
01:10:38,84 --> 01:10:43,46
I leave you alone because I have. No
other man ever did for the woman.

494
01:10:48,25 --> 01:10:48,55
To.

495
01:11:05,56 --> 01:11:05,91
Be back in.

496
01:11:17,57 --> 01:11:24,53
His automobile. Exactly where is the.

497
01:11:42,14 --> 01:11:46,82
Let's see. The right.

498
01:12:10,90 --> 01:12:13,99
You know all right what you. Now.

499
01:12:20,72 --> 01:12:20,87
Have

500
01:12:20,88 --> 01:13:18,97
a lot. Like. The

501
01:13:18,98 --> 01:13:24,87
AS. The the.

502
01:13:28,06 --> 01:13:32,87
The on

503
01:13:33,07 --> 01:13:36,38
the on.

504
01:13:37,52 --> 01:13:42,14
The the.

505
01:13:45,09 --> 01:13:50,75
The on the right. I know

506
01:13:51,61 --> 01:13:58,13
the the yes

507
01:14:00,35 --> 01:14:04,55
another woman in the waterfront
neighborhood again but is the woman dead.

508
01:14:09,55 --> 01:14:12,46
And yes naturally

509
01:14:12,47 --> 01:14:48,39
a lot Rob is going to
learn of our. Professor

510
01:14:48,40 --> 01:14:54,92
level film and then he went out. For the
structure I told you we are both inside

511
01:14:54,93 --> 01:15:01,71
the one and we both turned it in move
one. Let's go in there on. What are

512
01:15:01,72 --> 01:15:05,98
you up to complain we did not achieve if
you won't let me take that up then I'll

513
01:15:05,99 --> 01:15:10,10
see if you can see it's your fault from now
on your mind your own business getting

514
01:15:10,59 --> 01:15:11,15
your orders.

515
01:15:30,20 --> 01:15:32,43
Where was the setting I asked
you right here in this role.

516
01:15:37,76 --> 01:15:41,69
Sitting in the seat you never let
him out of sight. Outside for

517
01:15:41,70 --> 01:15:47,40
a minute about his cigarette but I never
let him out of sight and who was there

518
01:15:47,41 --> 01:15:50,34
sitting next to you when I think
it through you'll be back in

519
01:15:50,35 --> 01:15:56,100
a beaten uniform remind me what was he
wearing. One of the have on he was wearing

520
01:15:57,01 --> 01:16:00,79
a camel. Like opening a phonebook with

521
01:16:00,80 --> 01:16:05,93
a name. That Here you see right
here where we were back to.

522
01:16:21,02 --> 01:16:25,31
Headquarters told me I would probably
find you here. Top got it on money could.

523
01:16:28,27 --> 01:16:34,39
Never be able to forgive myself You mean
like the others and this what do you think

524
01:16:34,40 --> 01:16:39,100
it is. No doubt about that.

525
01:16:43,32 --> 01:16:48,93
I don't know if it's human or what I think
it might be. I don't examine right away

526
01:16:49,18 --> 01:16:50,07
rest of you come with me.

527
01:17:08,95 --> 01:17:14,78
I don't have the courage to
kill. Her life I don't have.

528
01:17:16,72 --> 01:17:22,38
I feel. I'm not what I was before. I.

529
01:17:26,13 --> 01:17:26,72
Don't want.

530
01:17:35,60 --> 01:17:42,53
To they make anything and there's nothing
more I can do there's no hope. I mean it

531
01:17:42,54 --> 01:17:48,64
you. Know. The trick I think
in the fact that last.

532
01:17:50,40 --> 01:17:56,04
Year I had me say that. Now Janet we must
leave I don't believe you but you're

533
01:17:56,05 --> 01:18:03,01
completely cured then this part of us. Who
did it when I began to think that come

534
01:18:03,02 --> 01:18:09,18
on get. Any more time you must get away
from the things that's going to. Have you

535
01:18:09,19 --> 01:18:13,00
lost your mind yet those policemen suspect
about the time the police well you don't

536
01:18:13,45 --> 01:18:17,58
explain it to you I don't want to harm me
now how do you know I'm not leaving would

537
01:18:17,59 --> 01:18:20,03
you try next. You made me

538
01:18:20,04 --> 01:18:26,92
a promise and this is going
to be the day you. I want. To

539
01:18:26,93 --> 01:18:33,70
do for you I. Live on the

540
01:18:33,71 --> 01:18:38,24
star of the fourth but then you know I can
no longer control you I don't you know.

541
01:18:39,93 --> 01:18:45,71
Tell me that you will never abandon
me no. You begin to understand.

542
01:18:48,17 --> 01:18:53,74
Can you tell me that you will run away with
me is my only hope of salvation. In the

543
01:18:53,75 --> 01:18:58,77
menu into for help and we love
it so much. And the drug.

544
01:19:05,23 --> 01:19:09,65
Trade mark of the man who condemns help
when you have that much covered you think

545
01:19:09,66 --> 01:19:10,12
because in

546
01:19:10,13 --> 01:19:18,11
a moment or two you will go mad that
was already you don't go. Right. Back

547
01:19:18,12 --> 01:19:22,30
to that you don't look at me I'm going
to be when I say you can save me if you

548
01:19:22,31 --> 01:19:28,79
would say to me. I guess if I know well.

549
01:19:30,79 --> 01:19:36,66
You know one minute. Coming with
me when you want to or not.

550
01:19:38,83 --> 01:19:41,36
I don't come about because I'm

551
01:19:41,37 --> 01:19:52,03
a turning on to never see
your peril given. That

552
01:19:52,03 --> 01:19:52,03
.

553
01:20:02,91 --> 01:20:09,05
