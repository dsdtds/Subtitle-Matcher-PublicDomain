1
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:36,568
This is it, Rupert.
Our big chance.

2
00:01:37,057 --> 00:01:39,537
Maybe next week, your
name will go up in lights.

3
00:01:39,593 --> 00:01:42,073
Rupert, the talk of the town.

4
00:01:42,229 --> 00:01:44,800
You won't let me
down, will you, Rupert?

5
00:01:44,866 --> 00:01:47,252
You'll do everything
just like I taught you?

6
00:01:47,366 --> 00:01:49,212
Ah yes, now...

7
00:01:49,437 --> 00:01:52,941
Now, how about a
dress rehearsal? Here.

8
00:01:54,475 --> 00:01:57,081
The curtain is up.
You're on the stage.

9
00:01:57,745 --> 00:02:00,522
Stay right there
when I tell you.

10
00:02:00,616 --> 00:02:03,460
Now get ready for
our song and dance.

11
00:02:03,519 --> 00:02:04,930
Are you all set?

12
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:07,430
One, two...

13
00:02:54,673 --> 00:02:57,210
Now we've got to do
the dance in unison.

14
00:02:57,275 --> 00:03:01,724
And it's got to be perfect, for
everything depends on how we do it.

15
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,953
You all set? Here we go.

16
00:03:27,541 --> 00:03:30,647
- Phil, I'm so glad to see you.
- Joe, how have you been?

17
00:03:30,711 --> 00:03:33,715
Not too good, but
everything's gonna change now.

18
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:35,850
Sit down. How are you, miss?

19
00:03:35,917 --> 00:03:38,955
This is Joe Mahoney. He used
to work out of my father's office.

20
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:42,433
And the best lion-tamer in
the business. Weren't you?

21
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,527
- Go on with you.
- Delighted, I'm sure.

22
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:45,832
Thank you.

23
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:48,067
What's this new act
that you wired me about?

24
00:03:48,129 --> 00:03:50,770
Here it is. Now greet
the man, Rupert.

25
00:03:56,705 --> 00:03:58,946
You mean, that's it?

26
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,349
That's it.

27
00:04:00,543 --> 00:04:02,216
- A squirrel?
- Sure.

28
00:04:02,444 --> 00:04:06,222
- You wouldn't fool me, would you?
- He's a great performer.

29
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:09,625
Something like Rupert only
happens once in a million years.

30
00:04:09,686 --> 00:04:13,600
I'm sorry, Joe, but
I'm not interested.

31
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,771
- He's not box office.
- Come on, honey, we're late.

32
00:04:18,428 --> 00:04:22,138
- Phil, you haven't seen what he can do.
- I've seen enough already.

33
00:04:22,233 --> 00:04:23,268
Joe, look...

34
00:04:23,334 --> 00:04:25,780
a lion is a big, savage beast.

35
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,847
He's vicious, ruthless.

36
00:04:27,905 --> 00:04:31,352
A bloodthirsty killer from the
faraway jungles of darkest Africa.

37
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:32,820
So he's box office.

38
00:04:32,877 --> 00:04:35,824
But a little pipsqueak
thing like a squirrel...

39
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,761
that anybody can see
anyplace, in any park, anytime...

40
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:43,063
Besides, he's so small, they'd
never see him in the balcony.

41
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:45,829
But I tell you,
Rupert's almost human.

42
00:04:45,924 --> 00:04:48,234
- Come on, honey, we're late.
- Just a minute.

43
00:04:48,293 --> 00:04:49,533
Look, Joe...

44
00:04:49,595 --> 00:04:52,873
I'd love to give you a break. I
know things have been tough.

45
00:04:54,334 --> 00:04:57,110
- But he just ain't...
- Box office.

46
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:23,173
Goodbye, Mr. Dingle. I'll pay
you every cent that I owe you.

47
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,837
You should, Mahoney.

48
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:39,557
Pete. Get a broom and pail,
and help me clean this place out.

49
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:06,311
It's nice and peaceful here,
ain't it? You can breathe.

50
00:06:07,511 --> 00:06:11,619
Take a good look around
at some of your new pals.

51
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:15,959
I want you to go on and get
acquainted with them. Come on.

52
00:06:16,821 --> 00:06:18,459
That's it.

53
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:23,637
Don't be stubborn
about this. Go on.

54
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,978
To be sure, it's a silly outfit.

55
00:06:32,471 --> 00:06:35,680
There you are. They
would have laughed at you.

56
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,888
Now, go on. Yes, I
know you don't want to.

57
00:06:42,816 --> 00:06:44,955
I know you'll be happy here.

58
00:06:45,552 --> 00:06:48,499
I know they'll love you.
You'll be the life of the party...

59
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:52,628
doing the somersaults and all
the cute little tricks that I taught you.

60
00:06:53,226 --> 00:06:55,103
Go on, I tell you.

61
00:06:56,129 --> 00:06:57,734
Beat it, I tell you.

62
00:06:58,499 --> 00:07:00,172
Beat it, I tell you.

63
00:07:05,206 --> 00:07:07,015
What shall I do?

64
00:07:09,744 --> 00:07:11,849
You just ain't box office.

65
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:16,558
Papa, do you think we might have
some money in that Chicago account?

66
00:07:16,618 --> 00:07:20,566
I heard from that bank last week.
I think I got the letter with me.

67
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,562
Here it is.

68
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:32,811
It says, "Dear Mr. Amendola, this is the
last monthly statement we will mail you.

69
00:07:33,069 --> 00:07:37,745
"We feel it is hardly worth three
cents to tell you you have two cents."

70
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,149
Let's get going.

71
00:07:40,209 --> 00:07:44,283
Look at all those lucky people,
hurrying home with arms full of packages.

72
00:07:44,381 --> 00:07:47,954
They'll have turkey for
Christmas, packages under the tree.

73
00:07:48,052 --> 00:07:50,123
Don't envy them, Rosalinda.

74
00:07:50,187 --> 00:07:53,896
I bet every one of them faced a
Christmas like us at some time or another.

75
00:07:53,957 --> 00:07:58,838
Besides, it ain't Christmas yet. Saint
Nick may have a bundle for us, too.

76
00:07:59,197 --> 00:08:02,542
But the trouble is, we ain't got
no address he can deliver them to.

77
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:05,444
Amendola! The Amendola Trio!

78
00:08:05,503 --> 00:08:09,007
- Joe Mahoney!
- Joe, darling!

79
00:08:09,074 --> 00:08:11,350
Now, don't tell me
this is little Rosie.

80
00:08:11,409 --> 00:08:14,948
She's certainly growing
fast. A little too fast.

81
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:17,654
It seems like only yesterday
I bought her them shoes...

82
00:08:17,716 --> 00:08:20,287
and already she's
complaining they're too small.

83
00:08:20,352 --> 00:08:22,832
And with you? How's
the act been going?

84
00:08:23,055 --> 00:08:25,467
Us? Great. Sensational.

85
00:08:25,558 --> 00:08:28,971
If I made any more money,
I'd have to buy myself a wallet.

86
00:08:29,195 --> 00:08:31,073
And you know something?

87
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:34,839
We've played the circuit so
many times, just for a change...

88
00:08:34,901 --> 00:08:36,403
we booked a European tour.

89
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,314
- Europe?
- London, Paris, Budapest.

90
00:08:39,673 --> 00:08:43,416
And in India, we gave a performance
the audience will never forget.

91
00:08:43,510 --> 00:08:46,458
- Why?
- Because they were elephants.

92
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:52,088
Please, a little respect for
that joke. It's older than you.

93
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:54,999
Sorry, Joe.

94
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:58,564
I see you haven't
been doing so good.

95
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:03,433
- To tell you the truth, it has been a little...
- You don't have to tell me.

96
00:09:03,499 --> 00:09:08,039
It's the same with us. We haven't
worked since Rosie cut her second teeth.

97
00:09:09,338 --> 00:09:13,081
- Joe, do you live around here?
- I do. I did.

98
00:09:13,142 --> 00:09:16,055
I just moved out less
than a half-hour ago.

99
00:09:16,211 --> 00:09:19,557
- Is the place rented yet?
- I don't think so.

100
00:09:19,616 --> 00:09:21,960
- How much rent did you pay?
- I didn't.

101
00:09:22,018 --> 00:09:25,329
But if you've got $32,
you can move right in.

102
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:29,434
How long did you live there
without paying any rent?

103
00:09:29,492 --> 00:09:30,664
Six months.

104
00:09:30,727 --> 00:09:34,107
Just what we're looking for.
Something out of the high-rent district.

105
00:09:34,298 --> 00:09:38,075
- It's been good seeing you.
- You must drop in and see us soon.

106
00:09:38,135 --> 00:09:39,580
Yes, thank you.

107
00:09:40,638 --> 00:09:42,447
Wait for me!

108
00:09:43,307 --> 00:09:46,914
- Hadn't you better ask him where it is?
- We ain't got no time.

109
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,481
Joe!

110
00:09:51,883 --> 00:09:56,195
- Where is it?
- 322-and-a-half Maple Street. Over there.

111
00:09:56,454 --> 00:09:58,866
Come on back. It's this way.

112
00:10:03,195 --> 00:10:04,903
Wait for me!

113
00:10:05,965 --> 00:10:07,672
Merry Christmas.

114
00:10:39,267 --> 00:10:40,837
Come here. Here, boy.

115
00:11:35,126 --> 00:11:36,127
Hello.

116
00:11:36,193 --> 00:11:38,765
Pardon this
unseemly protrusion...

117
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,743
but after reading this sign, I
took the liberty of removing it.

118
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:45,475
- I don't think you'll need it anymore.
- You wanna rent this place?

119
00:11:45,971 --> 00:11:49,714
We might work something out,
if you don't drag lawyers into this.

120
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:53,585
You'd better speak to my father
about it. He's right next door.

121
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:59,093
On second thought, I
can handle this myself.

122
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,193
Come in.

123
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:04,559
Be back in a minute.

124
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,449
Gosh, it's good to be home.

125
00:12:23,544 --> 00:12:26,856
- My name is Amendola.
- My name is Pete Dingle.

126
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,294
Rosalinda.

127
00:12:30,618 --> 00:12:32,359
Joe Mahoney sent us.

128
00:12:33,488 --> 00:12:37,197
That's okay with me, but
don't mention it to my father.

129
00:12:37,826 --> 00:12:40,034
The rent will be $32 a month.

130
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:44,070
I don't mind electric
bulbs that are unfrosted.

131
00:12:45,735 --> 00:12:49,808
I don't mind beds with
springs that fight back...

132
00:12:51,407 --> 00:12:54,479
or window shades that
curl up like anchovies.

133
00:12:54,944 --> 00:12:59,189
But there's one thing I
can't stand. Leaky faucets.

134
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:04,924
- Do you mind?
- Not at all.

135
00:13:08,158 --> 00:13:09,262
Perfect.

136
00:13:09,526 --> 00:13:12,736
Mama, you might as
well start unpacking.

137
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:16,141
This ain't exactly the
bridal suite at the Waldorf.

138
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,976
But who knows? If we give
this place a good cleaning...

139
00:13:19,036 --> 00:13:22,916
- we might find an extra room.
- "Good cleaning" is right.

140
00:13:23,274 --> 00:13:25,117
Look at all those cobwebs.

141
00:13:25,176 --> 00:13:29,182
Don't touch those cobwebs. They're
probably holding the building together.

142
00:13:29,715 --> 00:13:31,991
Now that all the business
has been taken care of...

143
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:35,759
But you see, my father, unfortunately,
wants his money in advance.

144
00:13:35,821 --> 00:13:40,793
And a lucky man he is, too, your father,
having a son so gifted in the art of music.

145
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:43,036
I just fool around...

146
00:13:43,096 --> 00:13:46,236
I know. I, too, am a musician.

147
00:13:46,466 --> 00:13:49,811
Modesty compels me to
admit that I play a pretty piano...

148
00:13:49,869 --> 00:13:53,282
and if necessary, I can
even play an ugly one.

149
00:13:54,674 --> 00:13:57,314
Don't forget. Feel free
to drop in at any time.

150
00:13:57,845 --> 00:13:59,051
Thanks very much.

151
00:13:59,346 --> 00:14:00,518
About the rent...

152
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:03,653
- I think I'm gonna like it here.
- I hope so.

153
00:14:04,251 --> 00:14:07,198
Now, if you don't
mind, I'd like to change.

154
00:14:07,254 --> 00:14:09,632
No, not at all. I mean...

155
00:14:10,257 --> 00:14:12,294
I'll see you later.

156
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:23,679
- Well, Mama, I did it.
- Look, Pa, he forgot his tuba.

157
00:14:23,738 --> 00:14:28,517
He'll be back. But if he don't, you can
blow on it every night and announce dinner.

158
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:31,922
You realize what I've done?

159
00:14:32,014 --> 00:14:34,927
No rent in advance, and
a roof over our heads.

160
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:39,764
There's an awful big
hole in the skylight.

161
00:14:41,257 --> 00:14:45,866
So what? If it snows, we'll be the only
ones in town to have a white Christmas...

162
00:14:45,929 --> 00:14:48,535
inside the house and out.

163
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,040
- Hello, Pete.
- Hi.

164
00:14:51,101 --> 00:14:53,342
I think I got a letter for you.

165
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:56,144
- No, it's for your old man.
- I'll give it to him.

166
00:14:56,206 --> 00:14:58,777
If I don't see you
tomorrow, merry Christmas.

167
00:14:59,944 --> 00:15:01,355
Same to you.

168
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:11,128
- Did you clean the place?
- Clean it? I rented it.

169
00:15:11,189 --> 00:15:13,726
Good, you can work if
you make up your mind.

170
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:16,534
- Who'd you rent it to?
- Their name is Amendola.

171
00:15:16,862 --> 00:15:17,863
Their?

172
00:15:18,464 --> 00:15:20,740
- How many are there?
- Just three.

173
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:22,107
They're awfully nice people.

174
00:15:22,167 --> 00:15:25,080
That's good for a
change. I'll take the money.

175
00:15:26,605 --> 00:15:28,551
There's a mother and a father...

176
00:15:28,607 --> 00:15:31,452
- and a daughter.
- Okay, give me the $32.

177
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:36,523
They didn't even ask for any
redecorations or repairing anything.

178
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,718
That saves us a
lot of money, Pa.

179
00:15:38,785 --> 00:15:41,425
Don't tell me you let
them stay without paying.

180
00:15:41,488 --> 00:15:44,264
You're gonna get it.
They're awfully nice people.

181
00:15:44,624 --> 00:15:46,969
A mother, and a
father and a daughter.

182
00:15:47,028 --> 00:15:51,238
You said that before. Look,
son, I want that $32 right now.

183
00:15:51,299 --> 00:15:53,643
If you don't get it, I'll
go and get it myself.

184
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:55,612
And if I don't get
it, out they go!

185
00:15:55,670 --> 00:15:58,549
But I gave my word of honor
we'd wait a couple of days.

186
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,143
You don't wanna break
your own son's word, do you?

187
00:16:01,208 --> 00:16:05,624
Honor, charity, love thy
neighbor. Everything but money.

188
00:16:05,714 --> 00:16:09,628
Tell me, son, what did money ever
do to you that you hate it so much?

189
00:16:10,786 --> 00:16:11,958
I'll get it.

190
00:16:16,191 --> 00:16:17,261
Oh, hello.

191
00:16:17,326 --> 00:16:20,001
Hello. You forgot
to give me the key.

192
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,475
The key? Yes, the key.

193
00:16:23,099 --> 00:16:24,578
- Here it is.
- Thank you.

194
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:25,874
Wait a minute.

195
00:16:27,303 --> 00:16:29,681
- You'll stay, won't you?
- If my father...

196
00:16:29,739 --> 00:16:31,116
Who is it, Pete?

197
00:16:33,309 --> 00:16:35,756
Don't go away.
I'll be right back.

198
00:16:38,182 --> 00:16:42,221
- Who was it?
- The postman. It's for you.

199
00:16:44,655 --> 00:16:48,102
National Security Bank.
What do those chiselers want?

200
00:16:53,531 --> 00:16:54,976
What is it?

201
00:16:57,335 --> 00:16:59,645
Just an advertisement.

202
00:17:03,808 --> 00:17:06,380
Katie, come here.

203
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:07,884
What is it?

204
00:17:07,947 --> 00:17:11,394
That worthless gold mine I
invested in 10 years ago is paying off.

205
00:17:11,450 --> 00:17:13,487
Here's a check for $1,500.

206
00:17:13,552 --> 00:17:16,965
And they say we're gonna get the
same amount each week from now on.

207
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:21,439
Mercy! It's the day before
Christmas, too. It's money from heaven.

208
00:17:21,495 --> 00:17:24,669
- We should go to church and pray.
- Sure.

209
00:17:24,731 --> 00:17:27,439
But first I'll go down to the
bank and cash the check.

210
00:17:27,501 --> 00:17:30,880
I know that apartment isn't
what you folks have been used to.

211
00:17:31,171 --> 00:17:35,244
- But with a little paint and fixing it up...
- You mean, you'll redecorate it?

212
00:17:37,345 --> 00:17:39,154
I'll speak to my
father about it.

213
00:17:39,213 --> 00:17:42,751
Mother's been having a little
trouble with the stove. It's awfully old.

214
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:45,229
We'll see what we
can do about that, too.

215
00:17:45,286 --> 00:17:47,926
- Maybe get you another one.
- A new stove!

216
00:17:48,623 --> 00:17:51,263
- Is there somebody asleep in there?
- My father.

217
00:17:52,961 --> 00:17:55,999
My father's a little reluctant
about investing money.

218
00:17:56,165 --> 00:17:58,372
He has to be handled
with kid gloves.

219
00:17:58,634 --> 00:18:02,309
- Say, how about going for a walk?
- Not in these shoes, I wouldn't.

220
00:18:02,371 --> 00:18:05,352
- They pinch my feet.
- Go get some others. I'll wait for you.

221
00:18:05,407 --> 00:18:08,321
It'll be a long wait. I
haven't any others.

222
00:18:08,978 --> 00:18:10,616
What size do you wear?

223
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,921
Dreaming of a size 4. Why?

224
00:18:13,383 --> 00:18:15,363
Stay right where you are.

225
00:18:18,254 --> 00:18:20,461
Not a word of this
to a soul, Katie.

226
00:18:20,523 --> 00:18:22,936
Not anybody, especially
that lazy son of yours.

227
00:18:22,993 --> 00:18:26,270
If he finds out, he'll blow that
blasted tuba the rest of his life.

228
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:28,936
- Mom, what size shoe do you wear?
- 6, why?

229
00:18:29,033 --> 00:18:30,307
Never mind.

230
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:34,315
Don't you buy shoes for me for
Christmas. I've got two pairs already.

231
00:18:35,639 --> 00:18:39,349
Isn't that nice? Not a nickel in his
pocket, and he wants to buy me shoes.

232
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:42,620
Just for that, Frank, I want you
to buy a nice necktie for him...

233
00:18:42,681 --> 00:18:46,185
and put it under the Christmas tree.
He likes those hand-painted ones.

234
00:18:46,251 --> 00:18:48,891
I saw some perfectly
lovely ones for only $5.

235
00:18:49,955 --> 00:18:51,059
$5, eh?

236
00:18:51,123 --> 00:18:54,503
I'll get some paint out of
the attic and paint one myself.

237
00:18:58,798 --> 00:19:01,745
They called us the Amendola
Trio, the Human Pyramid.

238
00:19:02,068 --> 00:19:03,809
Papa balanced Mama
on his shoulders...

239
00:19:03,870 --> 00:19:06,908
and then I stood on top of
Mama, all done up like a little angel.

240
00:19:06,973 --> 00:19:08,077
Sounds exciting.

241
00:19:08,141 --> 00:19:10,782
Papa juggled, Mama
sang, and I played the harp.

242
00:19:10,844 --> 00:19:12,187
Used to go over big.

243
00:19:12,246 --> 00:19:14,726
Only I started growing,
Mama got heavier...

244
00:19:14,782 --> 00:19:17,262
and one day,
Papa's legs gave out.

245
00:19:17,351 --> 00:19:18,830
You mean he dropped you?

246
00:19:18,886 --> 00:19:22,595
Four times in one week. The
fourth time, Mama broke her leg.

247
00:19:22,656 --> 00:19:24,431
You gotta hand
it to Papa, though.

248
00:19:24,491 --> 00:19:27,336
He never broke a plate.
He's a great juggler.

249
00:19:28,062 --> 00:19:31,043
Look, there's my father,
coming out of the bank.

250
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:43,349
- Wonder what he was doing in the bank.
- I've never been in a bank.

251
00:19:43,412 --> 00:19:45,551
Just to think of all that
money in one place.

252
00:19:45,614 --> 00:19:49,460
A week ago, this tree was $7.
Yesterday, $4. Now, what are my bids?

253
00:19:49,518 --> 00:19:51,088
- 40 cents.
- Make it $1.

254
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:52,154
One dollar.

255
00:19:52,221 --> 00:19:54,394
I wish we were
gonna have a tree.

256
00:19:54,456 --> 00:19:56,403
Of course, with
the moving and all...

257
00:19:56,459 --> 00:19:59,099
We've talked enough about
me. Tell me, where do you work?

258
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:01,164
I don't. That is, I write music.

259
00:20:01,231 --> 00:20:03,006
- Does it pay?
- No.

260
00:20:03,066 --> 00:20:04,374
Then you don't work.

261
00:20:04,434 --> 00:20:06,505
- I don't have a job.
- Can't you find one?

262
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:08,846
- I've never looked for one.
- What about money?

263
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:10,316
I don't need money.

264
00:20:10,373 --> 00:20:14,186
Suppose you were walking with a
girl, and she wanted a malted milk.

265
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:15,690
What would you do?

266
00:20:15,746 --> 00:20:18,283
Well, that would be
pretty embarrassing.

267
00:20:20,151 --> 00:20:22,131
I'm sorry I said that, Pete.

268
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:23,529
Come on, let's go home.

269
00:20:25,456 --> 00:20:28,370
Folks, just two more left.
What am I bid for this one?

270
00:20:28,427 --> 00:20:30,236
- 40 cents.
- $1.50.

271
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:31,933
$1.50. Do I hear $2?

272
00:20:31,997 --> 00:20:35,672
$1.50, once, twice. Sold
to this gentleman for $1.50!

273
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,541
Now for the last tree. It's your last
chance. What're my bids for this one?

274
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:41,516
- 40 cents.
- 75 cents.

275
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,850
Do I hear $1? Will
someone make it $1?

276
00:20:43,910 --> 00:20:46,413
- 75 cents, once, twice...
- $1.

277
00:20:46,479 --> 00:20:49,392
$1, I've got. Once, twice,
sold to this gentleman for $1.

278
00:20:49,449 --> 00:20:50,792
Here you are, buddy.

279
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:54,297
Say, mister, would it be all
right if I pay you 40 cents now...

280
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:56,131
and the balance later?

281
00:20:56,189 --> 00:21:00,070
Sure! Just take the elevator to the
18th floor. That's our credit department.

282
00:21:00,127 --> 00:21:03,904
This is a cash sale, buddy. Do
you want the tree or don't you?

283
00:21:07,368 --> 00:21:08,574
Hey, wait!

284
00:21:09,904 --> 00:21:12,510
Look, you can have the
tree. Give me the 40 cents.

285
00:21:12,573 --> 00:21:14,178
Thanks!

286
00:21:14,242 --> 00:21:16,745
I'll pay you the rest
as soon as I can.

287
00:21:16,811 --> 00:21:19,314
I'll give you a week. If
you don't pay by then...

288
00:21:19,381 --> 00:21:22,191
I'll find out where you
live and take the tree back.

289
00:21:25,654 --> 00:21:27,361
11, 12...

290
00:21:27,622 --> 00:21:30,160
13, 14, 15.

291
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:33,400
- Why didn't you leave it at the bank?
- At the bank?

292
00:21:33,529 --> 00:21:34,769
Katie, you're not serious.

293
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:38,107
After all that happened to
our little savings in 1929?

294
00:21:38,534 --> 00:21:42,141
No, sirree, they're never gonna
get any of my money again.

295
00:21:42,338 --> 00:21:45,479
I'm going to hide it
right in this house.

296
00:21:49,479 --> 00:21:52,790
You better run over to the church
and say that little prayer now.

297
00:21:52,849 --> 00:21:54,487
You're sending me away...

298
00:21:54,551 --> 00:21:57,361
because you want to keep the
hiding place a secret from me.

299
00:21:57,421 --> 00:21:59,560
No, it isn't you,
Katie. It's Pete.

300
00:21:59,623 --> 00:22:02,298
You're too soft-hearted
with that boy.

301
00:22:02,593 --> 00:22:05,904
- I'm afraid that...
- What's the use of money if you hide it?

302
00:22:05,964 --> 00:22:07,602
Money's for buying things...

303
00:22:07,665 --> 00:22:09,804
to enjoy life, to
have some pleasure.

304
00:22:09,867 --> 00:22:12,211
That's a lot of hooey.
Money's for security...

305
00:22:12,270 --> 00:22:14,750
not to worry about the
future, to enjoy sleep.

306
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:16,342
All right, Frank, I'm going.

307
00:22:16,407 --> 00:22:18,911
I don't care if you stick
that money up the chimney...

308
00:22:18,978 --> 00:22:22,050
and let it smoke till it
smells like a ham butt.

309
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:04,897
How long is it going to be?

310
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:07,367
Moving from one
place to another.

311
00:23:07,429 --> 00:23:09,238
Always moving...

312
00:23:09,297 --> 00:23:12,005
never having a
place to call our home.

313
00:23:13,201 --> 00:23:16,011
Believe me, Lord,
we've tried so hard.

314
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:20,078
We've tried
everything. Everything.

315
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:27,021
But it's so difficult to find
a job for a human pyramid.

316
00:23:29,685 --> 00:23:31,528
You're our only hope.

317
00:23:31,888 --> 00:23:33,629
So it's up to you.

318
00:23:35,592 --> 00:23:36,764
Please.

319
00:25:03,318 --> 00:25:05,229
Tomorrow is Christmas.

320
00:25:06,121 --> 00:25:08,295
We haven't even got a tree.

321
00:25:09,325 --> 00:25:11,862
No money to buy
some little gifts.

322
00:25:13,329 --> 00:25:16,071
Not even a pair of
shoes for Rosalinda.

323
00:25:22,839 --> 00:25:25,446
She must have those shoes, Lord.

324
00:25:26,410 --> 00:25:28,549
She needs them real bad.

325
00:25:47,465 --> 00:25:48,876
Thank you!

326
00:26:36,918 --> 00:26:38,454
Tell me, Rosalinda...

327
00:26:38,586 --> 00:26:40,896
- do you still play the harp?
- Sure, why?

328
00:26:41,222 --> 00:26:44,670
I think I'll compose something
just for the harp and tuba.

329
00:26:44,727 --> 00:26:48,231
And I'm gonna call it The Melody
Of Two Orphaned Instruments.

330
00:26:48,297 --> 00:26:49,799
That's a cute title.

331
00:26:50,032 --> 00:26:52,569
- You think they'll go together?
- I don't know.

332
00:26:52,635 --> 00:26:54,239
But I'm hoping.

333
00:27:19,797 --> 00:27:22,004
Papa! Wait!

334
00:27:34,946 --> 00:27:36,926
But I don't understand.

335
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,989
A tree! Presents!

336
00:27:39,051 --> 00:27:40,894
And look at it, Papa, a turkey!

337
00:27:40,952 --> 00:27:44,730
And cranberry sauce, plum
pudding, candy, and nuts.

338
00:27:44,957 --> 00:27:46,959
And, look, brand-new shoes.

339
00:27:48,127 --> 00:27:50,004
But how? I don't understand.

340
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:52,302
You couldn't have won
it on a quiz program.

341
00:27:52,365 --> 00:27:55,471
- We haven't got any phone.
- No, Papa, I didn't win anything.

342
00:27:55,535 --> 00:27:58,345
Mama! Your wedding
ring! You didn't hock your...

343
00:27:58,404 --> 00:28:01,386
- No, I didn't hock anything. All I did...
- I know.

344
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:04,585
You wired that drummer in
Boston who had a crush on you.

345
00:28:04,645 --> 00:28:07,524
That sheik with the patent
leather shoes and tuxedo.

346
00:28:07,581 --> 00:28:10,858
I remember what he said when
we announced our engagement.

347
00:28:12,886 --> 00:28:15,367
Papa, that was 22 years ago.

348
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:17,835
I don't care if it
was 100 years ago!

349
00:28:17,892 --> 00:28:20,099
I never trusted a
guy with a tuxedo...

350
00:28:20,161 --> 00:28:21,731
especially a rented one.

351
00:28:21,796 --> 00:28:23,469
Let Mama explain, Papa.

352
00:28:23,698 --> 00:28:25,678
No, the money
didn't come from him.

353
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:27,543
It came from...

354
00:28:27,702 --> 00:28:30,080
Here, Papa, you'd
better sit down.

355
00:28:32,775 --> 00:28:36,780
- Better loosen your collar, Papa.
- Rosalinda, bring Papa a glass of water.

356
00:28:38,647 --> 00:28:41,093
Papa, you love me, don't you?

357
00:28:41,584 --> 00:28:44,087
- Of course I love you.
- And you trust me?

358
00:28:44,453 --> 00:28:47,094
You'd believe me if I told
you something, wouldn't you?

359
00:28:47,157 --> 00:28:50,366
Even if nobody else in the
world would believe me...

360
00:28:50,494 --> 00:28:52,974
you would believe me,
wouldn't you, Papa?

361
00:28:53,029 --> 00:28:54,838
Sure, I would, Mama.

362
00:28:56,400 --> 00:28:59,506
I was sitting right
here in this chair...

363
00:29:00,203 --> 00:29:01,911
and I was praying.

364
00:29:06,444 --> 00:29:08,048
This money...

365
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:11,049
$1,500..

366
00:29:11,282 --> 00:29:15,025
Come floating right down
through the hole in the skylight.

367
00:29:15,887 --> 00:29:17,799
$1.500?

368
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,897
- From heaven?
- You do believe me, don't you, Papa?

369
00:29:22,694 --> 00:29:25,504
If you said it, I
gotta believe you.

370
00:29:26,732 --> 00:29:29,303
Merry Christmas, Papa.

371
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:31,176
Merry Christmas, Papa.

372
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:36,248
You see, Rosie? I told you
old Saint Nick wouldn't forget us.

373
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,585
All we needed was an address.

374
00:29:41,347 --> 00:29:44,385
Frank, this perfume
is lovely. "Dangerous."

375
00:29:44,884 --> 00:29:48,093
Such a big bottle. It must
have cost at least $10.

376
00:29:48,154 --> 00:29:50,135
It's not that dangerous.

377
00:29:50,191 --> 00:29:52,933
This is a terrific tie,
Dad. Thanks again.

378
00:29:53,260 --> 00:29:56,070
Did you see the watermelons,
Mama? They're hand-painted.

379
00:29:57,264 --> 00:29:58,868
Now, who's that?

380
00:30:03,737 --> 00:30:06,844
Merry Christmas, young
man. May we come in?

381
00:30:06,908 --> 00:30:08,387
Why, of course.

382
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,548
Merry Christmas.

383
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:13,059
Merry Christmas to you.

384
00:30:16,785 --> 00:30:20,529
Why, Mr. Amendola, we
have the exact same ties on.

385
00:30:20,623 --> 00:30:24,230
It could be a lot worse if we were
girls wearing the same dresses.

386
00:30:26,929 --> 00:30:30,206
Mom, Dad, this is
Mr. and Mrs. Amendola...

387
00:30:30,266 --> 00:30:32,644
- and their daughter, Rosalinda.
- How do you do?

388
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:36,310
We're your new tenants, and the
Yuletide season being upon us...

389
00:30:36,373 --> 00:30:38,785
we thought we'd drop
in and pay you a visit.

390
00:30:38,842 --> 00:30:41,049
- To pay what?
- A visit, Frank.

391
00:30:43,046 --> 00:30:44,320
Make yourselves comfortable.

392
00:30:44,381 --> 00:30:46,258
- Do sit down.
- Thanks.

393
00:30:46,316 --> 00:30:49,889
- I'm glad you brought your harp.
- Can we put it right over here?

394
00:30:49,953 --> 00:30:52,560
That's a nice tree you
got there, Mr. Dingle.

395
00:30:52,624 --> 00:30:54,865
Where did you
get it? Molineri's?

396
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:58,464
Maybe we ought to go down there next
week and make our payments together.

397
00:30:58,530 --> 00:31:01,010
Payments? Speaking
of payments...

398
00:31:01,065 --> 00:31:02,874
just what do you
do for a living?

399
00:31:02,934 --> 00:31:05,915
Doesn't the name of Amendola
suggest nothing to you?

400
00:31:05,970 --> 00:31:08,952
You surely must have
seen us perform some place.

401
00:31:09,008 --> 00:31:12,785
Florida in the racing season,
Lake Placid in the winter season...

402
00:31:12,845 --> 00:31:15,485
or perhaps Africa in
the malaria season.

403
00:31:15,548 --> 00:31:20,019
Yes, sir, someday you'll be able to
say the Amendolas were your tenants.

404
00:31:20,286 --> 00:31:23,791
If I don't get my rent money,
I'll be able to say that tomorrow.

405
00:31:23,857 --> 00:31:26,463
I'm glad you brought
that up, Mr. Dingle.

406
00:31:26,526 --> 00:31:29,666
Now, if you'll just hang
your sock on the mantle...

407
00:31:29,729 --> 00:31:32,403
I'll drop in three months' rent.

408
00:31:32,732 --> 00:31:34,575
Keep the $4 change.

409
00:31:34,968 --> 00:31:37,278
Three months' rent in advance.

410
00:31:37,772 --> 00:31:41,618
Mr. Amendola, we're so glad
you folks dropped in on us.

411
00:31:41,842 --> 00:31:43,913
Katie, get
Mr. Amendola a chair...

412
00:31:43,978 --> 00:31:46,185
and some coffee and cake.

413
00:31:46,247 --> 00:31:48,090
Where's the Christmas spirit?

414
00:31:48,149 --> 00:31:50,823
That's right, where is
the Christmas spirit?

415
00:32:06,969 --> 00:32:09,541
I love the excitement
of Christmas.

416
00:32:10,506 --> 00:32:13,612
I'll never forget one Christmas
Eve when I was a kid.

417
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:16,546
I hung my stocking up on
the mantle and went to bed.

418
00:32:16,613 --> 00:32:20,254
When I woke up the next morning,
what do you think I found in the stocking?

419
00:32:20,316 --> 00:32:22,023
My father's foot!

420
00:32:26,924 --> 00:32:27,925
Soft.

421
00:32:30,461 --> 00:32:31,565
Soft.

422
00:32:33,964 --> 00:32:35,375
Wait a minute!

423
00:32:35,733 --> 00:32:37,872
Another outburst
like that, Mr. Dingle...

424
00:32:37,935 --> 00:32:40,246
and I'll hide your
electric trains.

425
00:32:44,209 --> 00:32:45,244
Soft.

426
00:32:47,946 --> 00:32:49,084
Soft!

427
00:32:50,849 --> 00:32:54,353
How do you like that? There's a
guy going in business for himself.

428
00:32:55,587 --> 00:32:57,829
Wait a minute. All together!

429
00:33:16,610 --> 00:33:18,590
This is wonderful.

430
00:34:05,195 --> 00:34:09,234
Mr. Dingle, this is gonna develop
into a long and beautiful friendship...

431
00:34:09,299 --> 00:34:11,836
even closer than
Damon and Phythenias.

432
00:34:23,848 --> 00:34:26,385
You'll notice Rosalinda
brought her harp along.

433
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:29,330
She didn't bring it to
slice hard-boiled eggs.

434
00:34:29,387 --> 00:34:31,128
All right, Rosalinda.

435
00:34:31,189 --> 00:34:33,931
- Here you are, Rosalinda.
- Thank you.

436
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:36,302
I finished The Melody for
Two Orphaned Instruments.

437
00:34:36,361 --> 00:34:39,831
- Wanna try it?
- Sure. Set the music right over here, Pete.

438
00:34:40,799 --> 00:34:42,710
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

439
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:49,353
- Ready?
- Yes.

440
00:35:30,351 --> 00:35:32,525
I don't want my
wife to hear this.

441
00:35:32,922 --> 00:35:35,266
The stage has
always fascinated me.

442
00:35:35,324 --> 00:35:38,134
Don't you think I've got
a very fine singing voice?

443
00:35:38,194 --> 00:35:41,232
Why, the bathtubs of the world
are full of singers, Mr. Dingle.

444
00:35:41,297 --> 00:35:45,473
But did you ever hear of anyone
doing a backflip in the bathtub? No.

445
00:35:45,534 --> 00:35:47,344
And you know the reason why?

446
00:35:47,404 --> 00:35:49,475
Because only a few
of us are acrobats.

447
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:52,952
Acrobats. I'd just love
to learn a few tricks.

448
00:35:53,009 --> 00:35:55,922
I'm always so dull when
company comes. I can't do a thing.

449
00:35:55,979 --> 00:35:58,357
Can you teach me a few things?

450
00:35:58,415 --> 00:36:00,656
I'd be glad to teach you.

451
00:36:00,717 --> 00:36:04,530
You got anything around here that
we could rig up like a teeterboard?

452
00:36:04,889 --> 00:36:06,493
- A seesaw?
- Yeah.

453
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:09,530
I think so. Let me see, now.

454
00:36:11,128 --> 00:36:14,200
- How about a table leaf?
- You got one? Go get it.

455
00:36:23,675 --> 00:36:26,155
Great, now get
me a glass of water.

456
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,526
Thanks.

457
00:36:35,588 --> 00:36:39,900
This is so simple, I taught it to
Rosalinda when she was only 3 years old.

458
00:36:39,959 --> 00:36:41,870
Now you get up on that chair.

459
00:36:42,195 --> 00:36:45,802
I'll stand down at this end, place
the glass of water on my head...

460
00:36:45,865 --> 00:36:48,539
and when I say go, you
jump down on that end.

461
00:36:48,968 --> 00:36:52,246
I will then do a back somersault,
light a cigarette in midair...

462
00:36:52,306 --> 00:36:55,446
and land in that chair without
spilling one drop of water.

463
00:36:55,509 --> 00:36:57,079
- Ready?
- Ready.

464
00:37:00,314 --> 00:37:01,315
Go.

465
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:09,157
Termites.

466
00:37:31,714 --> 00:37:34,923
That's so pretty, Pete.
And he wrote it himself.

467
00:37:35,551 --> 00:37:37,896
How well he plays the tuba!

468
00:37:38,655 --> 00:37:41,261
- It's lovely, Pete.
- So are you.

469
00:37:42,192 --> 00:37:45,002
Gosh, Rosalinda,
your hair, your dress...

470
00:37:45,562 --> 00:37:48,168
- Gosh, you're beautiful.
- Thank you, Pete.

471
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:50,944
- May I have this, Pete?
- Sure.

472
00:37:51,368 --> 00:37:52,746
I wrote it for you.

473
00:37:56,874 --> 00:38:00,651
Look, somebody's coming
to see us, in a beautiful car.

474
00:38:05,049 --> 00:38:08,827
Rosalinda, go down and see who it
is. It might be somebody important.

475
00:38:17,529 --> 00:38:21,136
- Yes?
- Hello. Is Joe Mahoney home?

476
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,238
- He's moved away.
- He has?

477
00:38:23,703 --> 00:38:26,377
- You know where he went?
- I'm afraid I don't.

478
00:38:26,439 --> 00:38:30,353
That's great. What do I do with
this Christmas present I brought him?

479
00:38:31,778 --> 00:38:33,451
Here, it's yours.

480
00:38:34,014 --> 00:38:35,755
- Go ahead.
- I really don't...

481
00:38:35,815 --> 00:38:37,692
It's just fruit and things.

482
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:40,159
- You live here?
- Yes.

483
00:38:40,221 --> 00:38:42,167
- Alone?
- With my parents.

484
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:43,896
That's nice.

485
00:38:46,761 --> 00:38:49,435
- Anything I can do for you?
- My name is Phil Davis.

486
00:38:49,497 --> 00:38:52,410
- I'm a friend of Joe Mahoney's...
- Phil Davis, the agent?

487
00:38:52,466 --> 00:38:55,812
- Yes, that's me.
- Believe me, this is a pleasure.

488
00:38:55,904 --> 00:38:59,249
My name is Amendola. You've heard
of the Amendola Trio, haven't you?

489
00:38:59,307 --> 00:39:02,015
You know, the Human
Pyramid? Come in.

490
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:11,997
Now, don't pay any attention
to this apartment, Mr. Davis.

491
00:39:12,055 --> 00:39:15,264
We just moved in yesterday.
Not much of a place...

492
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:19,031
but for certain reasons
it fascinates me.

493
00:39:19,662 --> 00:39:23,508
Mr. Davis, take a
look at this poster.

494
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:27,874
You're gazing at one of the
greatest vaudeville acts of its time.

495
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:30,885
And the only reason
we disbanded...

496
00:39:30,941 --> 00:39:33,547
was because of my little
daughter's rapid maturity.

497
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:38,286
- Yes, I can see what you mean.
- Mr. Davis, I was just thinking...

498
00:39:38,415 --> 00:39:42,125
I can work alone. Why, I can
out-juggle anyone in the business.

499
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:45,566
You know something? I can
juggle 25 plates with one hand.

500
00:39:45,757 --> 00:39:48,863
And with the other hand,
I pick up the broken ones.

501
00:39:50,562 --> 00:39:52,769
Just a little joke
I use in the act.

502
00:39:53,331 --> 00:39:56,005
Now if you give me
your undivided attention...

503
00:40:26,032 --> 00:40:29,981
Say, that's good. That's
great. How did you do it?

504
00:40:31,272 --> 00:40:32,683
How did you do it?

505
00:40:33,274 --> 00:40:36,585
What? That's a trade secret.

506
00:40:37,011 --> 00:40:39,457
- Do it again.
- Yes, do it again, Papa.

507
00:40:39,514 --> 00:40:43,463
Rosalinda, you know the great
Amendola never repeats twice.

508
00:40:44,486 --> 00:40:47,990
That's very clever. I'll try
and book you, Mr. Amendola.

509
00:40:48,123 --> 00:40:49,659
Sure.

510
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:53,406
- How about you?
- About me?

511
00:40:55,364 --> 00:40:58,402
I'm sorry to butt in,
but the coffee's ready.

512
00:40:59,369 --> 00:41:02,248
A girl with your looks and
figure should be in the limelight.

513
00:41:02,305 --> 00:41:04,410
And I'm just the man
that can put you there.

514
00:41:04,474 --> 00:41:08,149
Said he as he twirled his black
mustache and eyed the proud beauty.

515
00:41:08,211 --> 00:41:09,884
- Who's he?
- Please.

516
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,953
You were saying, Mr. Davis?

517
00:41:12,015 --> 00:41:15,020
A girl like you should
have a decent place to live.

518
00:41:15,619 --> 00:41:17,064
Not a dump like this.

519
00:41:17,121 --> 00:41:18,896
What's good enough
for my parents...

520
00:41:18,956 --> 00:41:21,698
Is hardly good enough
for a raving beauty like you.

521
00:41:21,759 --> 00:41:24,035
- And Mr. Davis here is just...
- Please.

522
00:41:24,528 --> 00:41:27,805
The coffee's ready. It's
getting cold, and so is the cake.

523
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:32,076
I'm sorry, but Mr. Davis is a
very important Broadway agent.

524
00:41:32,304 --> 00:41:36,116
- Broadway chiseler.
- I beg your pardon. What was that?

525
00:41:36,241 --> 00:41:37,686
I know the type.

526
00:41:37,742 --> 00:41:41,588
Promises young girls expensive
clothes, diamonds, furs.

527
00:41:41,846 --> 00:41:45,259
- Anything to make an impression.
- He didn't say that. You did.

528
00:41:45,317 --> 00:41:46,888
He was going to.

529
00:41:50,156 --> 00:41:53,501
What right has he got to call me a
chiseler? He doesn't even know me.

530
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,095
I think he's jealous.

531
00:41:57,129 --> 00:41:58,938
Maybe he's got a case.

532
00:41:59,198 --> 00:42:02,009
Say, it's Christmas,
and I'm all alone.

533
00:42:02,903 --> 00:42:05,474
How about me taking you
out to a Chinese dinner tonight?

534
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:07,177
I'm sorry, but I was...

535
00:42:08,141 --> 00:42:09,745
I'd love to.

536
00:42:10,377 --> 00:42:12,983
Father, may I go
out with Mr. Davis?

537
00:42:13,413 --> 00:42:16,292
- You better ask your mother.
- Thanks a lot.

538
00:42:20,021 --> 00:42:23,025
I threw five nuts up,
and only four came down.

539
00:42:23,791 --> 00:42:26,135
This defies the laws of gravity.

540
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:52,293
It's midnight. She
isn't home yet.

541
00:42:52,722 --> 00:42:55,601
Mama, stop worrying.
Nothing can happen to her.

542
00:42:55,859 --> 00:42:58,032
She's not alone.
She's with a man.

543
00:42:59,829 --> 00:43:02,275
Another miracle
happened this afternoon.

544
00:43:02,332 --> 00:43:05,678
- A miracle?
- I tried to juggle a few walnuts.

545
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:09,546
- One didn't come down. It just disappeared.
- Mercy me.

546
00:43:09,774 --> 00:43:13,881
This is a strange house. Money
comes down and walnuts go up.

547
00:43:14,512 --> 00:43:18,324
But I guess that's better than money
going up and walnuts coming down.

548
00:43:19,318 --> 00:43:21,662
I don't know what to make of it.

549
00:43:42,108 --> 00:43:44,179
Katie, Katie!

550
00:43:45,678 --> 00:43:47,123
What is it, Frank?

551
00:43:48,114 --> 00:43:50,652
I've been thinking about
that Amendola family.

552
00:43:50,718 --> 00:43:53,756
Why should people who can
afford three months' rent in advance...

553
00:43:53,821 --> 00:43:55,858
wanna live in a dump like that?

554
00:43:55,923 --> 00:43:59,871
Frank, last night you couldn't sleep
because they didn't pay their rent.

555
00:44:00,027 --> 00:44:02,473
Tonight you can't
sleep because they did.

556
00:44:03,297 --> 00:44:06,108
For goodness' sake, stop
worrying and go to sleep.

557
00:44:35,164 --> 00:44:38,169
Why don't you check out of
this town? Come to New York.

558
00:44:38,235 --> 00:44:41,944
- Things can happen to you there, Rosie.
- Let's not start that again, Phil.

559
00:44:42,005 --> 00:44:45,214
I'm crazy about you,
Rosie. I'll do anything for you.

560
00:44:46,243 --> 00:44:49,713
Do you know any
music publishers, Phil?

561
00:44:50,814 --> 00:44:52,954
Sure, dozens of them. Why?

562
00:44:53,017 --> 00:44:57,090
I wrote some music. I think it's
beautiful. If you could take it...

563
00:44:57,155 --> 00:44:59,260
I didn't know you
were a composer.

564
00:45:01,926 --> 00:45:05,305
"Melody for Two Orphaned
Instruments by Peter Dingle."

565
00:45:05,630 --> 00:45:07,234
Who's Peter Dingle?

566
00:45:07,298 --> 00:45:09,711
You see, I put a
man's name on it...

567
00:45:09,768 --> 00:45:13,272
because I knew no one would even
look at it if they knew a girl wrote it.

568
00:45:13,338 --> 00:45:16,751
I'll see what I can do. If it's any
good, I'll try and get it published.

569
00:45:16,809 --> 00:45:21,087
- Thanks a lot, Phil. Good night.
- Wait a minute.

570
00:45:22,247 --> 00:45:23,851
See you tomorrow.

571
00:46:12,001 --> 00:46:15,881
- I'm sorry to wake you up, Mr. Haggerty.
- What's the matter, Pete? Somebody sick?

572
00:46:15,938 --> 00:46:18,316
Yeah, me. I want that job.

573
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:23,819
Do you want to start right now, or
can you wait till tomorrow morning?

574
00:46:24,180 --> 00:46:26,991
I'm sorry, I was afraid
somebody else might get it.

575
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:29,758
You see, Mr. Haggerty,
I need money.

576
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:40,731
Hey, Pete.

577
00:46:41,431 --> 00:46:42,433
Yeah?

578
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:52,086
Bend closer, laddie boy.
This is for your ears alone.

579
00:46:53,111 --> 00:46:55,990
I got a sure thing in the
sixth at California today.

580
00:46:56,047 --> 00:46:58,824
Cut me in on 40 percent,
and I'll give it to you.

581
00:46:58,884 --> 00:47:01,023
This one can't lose.
It'll win in a walk.

582
00:47:01,086 --> 00:47:03,999
And while our horse is walking,
the others will be running.

583
00:47:04,056 --> 00:47:07,594
If you have another hot tip,
Mulligan, leave it under the plate.

584
00:47:13,466 --> 00:47:15,878
- Yes, sir?
- What's your best cigar?

585
00:47:15,936 --> 00:47:19,383
- Good ones are a quarter apiece.
- Quarter apiece?

586
00:47:19,706 --> 00:47:21,913
How much does a whole one cost?

587
00:47:23,243 --> 00:47:26,417
- It's just a little joke.
- As little as I've heard.

588
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:29,417
Pete.

589
00:47:32,320 --> 00:47:33,697
- Hello.
- Hi.

590
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:36,200
What will it be?

591
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:43,034
- I didn't know you worked here, Pete.
- That's strange. It was in the papers.

592
00:47:43,130 --> 00:47:46,271
But remember, once you told
me you were opposed to work.

593
00:47:46,435 --> 00:47:47,470
Sure.

594
00:47:47,869 --> 00:47:51,976
I even remember I couldn't buy a
certain girl a cool drink in a drugstore.

595
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:56,086
Now, not only can I buy it,
but serve it, too. What will it be?

596
00:47:58,146 --> 00:48:00,491
You took this job
on account of me.

597
00:48:00,883 --> 00:48:04,592
The girl I'm referring to
only wanted a malted milk.

598
00:48:06,289 --> 00:48:07,597
Can we go now?

599
00:48:08,191 --> 00:48:12,037
- It's you. Let's go, honey.
- I'd like a malted milk, Phil.

600
00:48:12,228 --> 00:48:15,004
- Not in this dump, please.
- Goodbye.

601
00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:17,868
So long.

602
00:48:21,305 --> 00:48:25,481
Pete, you're missing a great bid.
That filly's sure to wind up in the money.

603
00:48:25,609 --> 00:48:27,646
Yeah, that's what I'm afraid of.

604
00:48:44,029 --> 00:48:46,840
How's that for a
bargain? Only $49.50.

605
00:48:46,899 --> 00:48:50,369
But, Papa, what do we
want with a polar bear rug?

606
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:53,947
This isn't an ordinary
polar bear. Just watch.

607
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:57,110
All you got to do is
twist the tooth and...

608
00:48:59,879 --> 00:49:01,790
Music! It's also a radio.

609
00:49:02,616 --> 00:49:05,028
The other tooth
is for shortwave.

610
00:49:05,185 --> 00:49:08,723
- But we don't need it.
- Sure we do.

611
00:49:09,022 --> 00:49:11,366
It lends an air of
quality to the place.

612
00:49:11,425 --> 00:49:14,736
Mama, what's a real
home without a polar bear?

613
00:49:14,795 --> 00:49:17,241
But we must stop buying things.

614
00:49:17,297 --> 00:49:21,041
That $500 you have
left has got to last.

615
00:49:22,870 --> 00:49:25,043
I'm glad you brought that up.

616
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:28,986
You know that Mr. Byfield, who we
bought these few pieces of furniture off?

617
00:49:29,377 --> 00:49:33,189
I stopped by there today to look at
that little piano we were talking about.

618
00:49:33,247 --> 00:49:34,886
And you know something?

619
00:49:35,350 --> 00:49:38,854
- He isn't doing so well.
- Papa, I hope you didn't...

620
00:49:38,921 --> 00:49:41,401
It's not his fault
that business is bad.

621
00:49:41,457 --> 00:49:43,698
Naturally, with the banks
leaning on the place...

622
00:49:43,759 --> 00:49:45,796
- and no one to...
- Our last $500.

623
00:49:46,261 --> 00:49:49,368
Papa, all our lives,
you've been doing this.

624
00:49:49,499 --> 00:49:53,106
Whenever we get a little ahead,
you meet someone who's in trouble...

625
00:49:53,169 --> 00:49:56,946
and you just melt like
chocolate in a baby's hand.

626
00:49:57,207 --> 00:49:59,687
I couldn't help
it. He needed it.

627
00:50:00,276 --> 00:50:04,987
But, Mama, we got nothing to worry about.
We still got that $100 I gave you yesterday.

628
00:50:05,049 --> 00:50:09,930
No, I mailed that money away for
the unpaid bills we left in Chicago.

629
00:50:10,020 --> 00:50:12,830
That puts us right back
where we were a week ago.

630
00:50:13,657 --> 00:50:17,503
That's right. All you gotta do
is do what you did a week ago.

631
00:50:17,895 --> 00:50:18,896
Pray.

632
00:50:18,996 --> 00:50:21,409
Lam praying every
hour of the day.

633
00:50:21,466 --> 00:50:23,844
But if it's more money
you want me to pray for...

634
00:50:23,902 --> 00:50:26,246
Why not, Mother?
It's worth a try.

635
00:50:31,076 --> 00:50:33,989
I just wouldn't have
the nerve to ask again.

636
00:50:34,346 --> 00:50:36,327
Besides, it's selfish.

637
00:50:37,016 --> 00:50:39,656
But Papa just told us he
helped somebody with it.

638
00:50:39,719 --> 00:50:41,221
That wasn't selfish.

639
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:46,096
And besides, all you gotta do is ask,
and let heaven make up its own mind.

640
00:50:46,592 --> 00:50:50,369
- Even if I could remember the prayer...
- You must remember, Mother.

641
00:50:50,429 --> 00:50:53,877
- The same thing you said before.
- I don't know.

642
00:50:54,101 --> 00:50:57,310
All I recall saying is that
Rosalinda needs shoes.

643
00:50:57,371 --> 00:51:00,841
But now she doesn't need
shoes. She has four pairs already.

644
00:51:00,908 --> 00:51:03,787
But, Mama, when you
say she needs shoes...

645
00:51:03,844 --> 00:51:06,154
that doesn't mean
she really needs them.

646
00:51:06,213 --> 00:51:09,957
It's like stagehands in the
theater playing dice. A guy says:

647
00:51:10,018 --> 00:51:12,294
"Baby needs a
new pair of shoes."

648
00:51:12,353 --> 00:51:16,768
That doesn't mean she needs them.
It's just a disfigurement of speech.

649
00:51:17,492 --> 00:51:20,803
- All right, bring me the little old rocker.
- I'll get it.

650
00:51:20,862 --> 00:51:23,173
I was sitting in it
when it happened.

651
00:51:30,739 --> 00:51:32,582
Say it, Mama.

652
00:51:34,476 --> 00:51:38,823
Please, help us. Rosalinda needs
shoes. She needs them real bad.

653
00:51:57,368 --> 00:52:01,043
It's no use, Mama. The
prayer won't be answered.

654
00:52:02,440 --> 00:52:05,910
Maybe it has been answered,
and the answer is no.

655
00:52:11,650 --> 00:52:13,254
We're grateful, anyhow.

656
00:52:14,219 --> 00:52:17,393
I guess I'd better take
this rug back to the shop.

657
00:52:28,201 --> 00:52:30,681
Please forgive
me for telling a lie.

658
00:52:31,504 --> 00:52:34,041
Rosalinda doesn't need shoes.

659
00:52:44,485 --> 00:52:47,489
Come back! It's coming down!

660
00:53:05,874 --> 00:53:09,845
It happened exactly a week
ago at about the same time.

661
00:53:10,278 --> 00:53:14,250
- Exactly $1,500 again.
- Bless me!

662
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:18,322
All you gotta do is sit in that old
rocker every Thursday at 3:30 and say:

663
00:53:18,387 --> 00:53:21,664
"Rosalinda needs
shoes," and collect $1,500.

664
00:53:22,425 --> 00:53:25,065
It's funny how
simple life can be.

665
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:52,432
It's coming down.

666
00:54:31,465 --> 00:54:35,174
- Hello, Petrushka.
- Here's your pies and cake, Mr. Amendola.

667
00:54:35,269 --> 00:54:37,579
- Thanks.
- And here's a check.

668
00:54:37,638 --> 00:54:40,414
Your share of our
profits for this month.

669
00:54:42,009 --> 00:54:44,615
You cast your dough upon
the waters, it circulates...

670
00:54:44,678 --> 00:54:47,182
and it comes back
strawberry shortcake.

671
00:54:47,282 --> 00:54:49,785
- Thanks, partner.
- Thank you, Mr. Amendola.

672
00:54:54,189 --> 00:54:57,568
- Who was it, Papa?
- Petrushka, our baker.

673
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:05,741
Oh, mama.

674
00:55:09,005 --> 00:55:10,006
Look.

675
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,446
This is our share
of the month's profit.

676
00:55:14,811 --> 00:55:18,453
How much did we decide to contribute
to buy shoes for European children?

677
00:55:18,515 --> 00:55:19,823
$600. Why?

678
00:55:19,883 --> 00:55:23,228
Deposit this, and we
can make it $1,000.

679
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:25,567
That's fine.

680
00:55:26,557 --> 00:55:31,267
It's all over town. This Amendola
character gave $1,025 for kids' shoes.

681
00:55:31,328 --> 00:55:33,468
He lives in a stable
and sleeps on straw.

682
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:36,444
He doesn't work. It don't add
up. Where does he get the money?

683
00:55:36,801 --> 00:55:40,544
He gave $2,500 for
European children.

684
00:55:41,005 --> 00:55:43,542
- What line of business is he in?
- Nobody knows.

685
00:55:43,875 --> 00:55:47,756
Read all about it! Local man
gives thousands to charity!

686
00:55:47,813 --> 00:55:49,486
Read all about it!

687
00:55:50,082 --> 00:55:53,291
When they moved in, they
didn't have a nickel to their name.

688
00:55:53,352 --> 00:55:56,822
Two months later, he buys a
shipload of shoes for foreign kids.

689
00:55:57,323 --> 00:55:59,132
Now, how do you figure that?

690
00:55:59,525 --> 00:56:04,100
I'd like a Super-Duper
Triple-Decker Banana Delight.

691
00:56:04,297 --> 00:56:05,401
Coming UP-

692
00:56:05,499 --> 00:56:06,842
You know what I think?

693
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:10,643
He's printing his own money, right
there in that shack of yours, Mr. Dingle.

694
00:56:10,704 --> 00:56:14,311
I hate gossip. But I just
heard from a friend of mine...

695
00:56:14,374 --> 00:56:17,082
whose wife told him,
and she swears it's true...

696
00:56:17,477 --> 00:56:20,254
that Amendola is a
big gangster in hiding.

697
00:56:20,982 --> 00:56:24,555
And if I was you, Mr. Dingle,
I'd notify the police right away.

698
00:56:24,819 --> 00:56:27,663
Notify the FBI. I
saw it in a movie.

699
00:56:27,788 --> 00:56:29,859
Someone should write
them an anonymous letter.

700
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:33,701
Sure, write anonymous letters.
Report him to the police. Put him in jail.

701
00:56:33,761 --> 00:56:36,606
The guy has to be punished
because he has a big heart.

702
00:56:36,665 --> 00:56:40,477
Pipe down, Pete. I told you
never to argue with the customers.

703
00:56:41,236 --> 00:56:42,237
Sorry.

704
00:56:42,738 --> 00:56:45,742
I think it's all a lot of hooey.
You know what I heard?

705
00:56:45,807 --> 00:56:49,220
A man comes to see the pretty
Amendola girl every day in a big car.

706
00:56:49,278 --> 00:56:51,020
- We can't hear you.
- Louder.

707
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,391
A man comes to see their
daughter every day in a big car.

708
00:56:54,450 --> 00:56:56,930
True. He's a Broadway
agent. What about him?

709
00:56:56,986 --> 00:56:59,330
- Like a little strawberry?
- Sure.

710
00:57:00,557 --> 00:57:04,505
He's the individual that floods Amendola
with money, on account of that girl.

711
00:57:04,561 --> 00:57:06,508
- Some whipped cream?
- Love that.

712
00:57:06,697 --> 00:57:08,699
That's what I say about actors.

713
00:57:09,166 --> 00:57:12,613
People like the Amendolas can
contaminate a whole community.

714
00:57:13,003 --> 00:57:15,347
Just like one rotten
apple in a barrel.

715
00:57:19,510 --> 00:57:20,545
Pete!

716
00:57:20,611 --> 00:57:22,216
Oh, my goodness!

717
00:57:24,082 --> 00:57:25,857
I forgot the cherry.

718
00:57:34,526 --> 00:57:36,734
- What will it be?
- Bourbon and water.

719
00:57:37,697 --> 00:57:40,143
- Hi, Pete.
- Hi.

720
00:57:40,199 --> 00:57:42,372
Say, I had dinner
at the drugstore...

721
00:57:42,568 --> 00:57:46,482
and I heard you pushed a chocolate sundae
into a perfectly good customer's kisser.

722
00:57:46,539 --> 00:57:49,383
- Is it true?
- No, it was a Banana Delight.

723
00:57:50,576 --> 00:57:52,887
You're hurt, Pete.
Who hurt you, boy?

724
00:57:52,946 --> 00:57:56,086
Nobody. I just
counted my money...

725
00:57:56,216 --> 00:57:59,459
and I discovered I was 16
cents short of my first million.

726
00:57:59,686 --> 00:58:01,097
That makes me sad.

727
00:58:03,156 --> 00:58:05,830
Listen, Pete, if you're
open to a proposition...

728
00:58:05,892 --> 00:58:07,998
I know how to make
some real dough.

729
00:58:08,062 --> 00:58:10,042
Get this. A friend of mine...

730
00:58:11,933 --> 00:58:16,075
Look, Eddie, why don't you make
like a ballerina and dance away?

731
00:58:16,371 --> 00:58:19,511
Here, stick this in the jukebox
and play something loud.

732
00:58:21,309 --> 00:58:23,984
This friend of mine is
drilling for oil in California.

733
00:58:24,046 --> 00:58:27,493
He's down 9,000 feet.
Got 500 more to go.

734
00:58:27,850 --> 00:58:31,525
So now it's oil stocks. Don't
you ever give up, Mulligan?

735
00:58:31,654 --> 00:58:35,693
But, Pete, for only $2,000, you can
grab yourself 20 percent interest...

736
00:58:35,758 --> 00:58:37,738
and become a
millionaire in no time.

737
00:58:37,793 --> 00:58:41,401
Are you out of your mind?
Where would I get $2,000?

738
00:58:41,665 --> 00:58:43,269
How about asking your old man?

739
00:58:43,333 --> 00:58:46,439
Don't be ridiculous. My
father gets a small pension.

740
00:58:46,770 --> 00:58:50,741
- He's happy if he can make ends meet.
- That's what you think, Junior.

741
00:58:51,608 --> 00:58:54,647
My brother-in-law, who happens
to be a policeman at the bank...

742
00:58:54,712 --> 00:58:59,024
says that old man of yours has been
cashing pretty large checks for weeks now.

743
00:58:59,283 --> 00:59:02,730
Wait a minute. I did see him
coming out of the bank once.

744
00:59:03,421 --> 00:59:06,197
- He gets a letter from them every week.
- You see?

745
00:59:06,257 --> 00:59:08,703
All you have to do is
ask him to back you.

746
00:59:08,759 --> 00:59:11,263
What father could
refuse such a proposition?

747
00:59:11,330 --> 00:59:14,607
Tell me, Mulligan, is
this really on the level?

748
00:59:14,666 --> 00:59:16,145
Tell you what I'll do.

749
00:59:16,201 --> 00:59:19,410
I'll introduce you to my friend.
He'll show you the papers.

750
00:59:19,471 --> 00:59:22,350
And besides, he'll give
you all the security you want.

751
00:59:22,407 --> 00:59:24,011
I'll see you tomorrow.

752
00:59:26,412 --> 00:59:30,087
There must be a screw loose in your
head. Who's got $2,000? What $2,000?

753
00:59:30,149 --> 00:59:33,494
I know you have it. You've been
seen in the bank cashing large checks.

754
00:59:33,553 --> 00:59:36,329
That's a lie. Now get out. I
don't want to hear any more.

755
00:59:36,389 --> 00:59:39,268
I'll pay you back. I'll
repay you 10 times over.

756
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:41,636
But I haven't
got it, I tell you!

757
00:59:42,196 --> 00:59:44,540
Pa, you must give it
to me. You simply must.

758
00:59:44,598 --> 00:59:48,546
Get out, you crazy fool. Get out before I
break that blasted tuba over your head.

759
00:59:48,602 --> 00:59:49,842
Get out!

760
01:00:12,528 --> 01:00:14,530
- Goodbye.
- I'll walk you there.

761
01:00:14,597 --> 01:00:16,076
No, that's all right.

762
01:00:16,132 --> 01:00:18,271
- Sure you can get in all right?
- Sure.

763
01:00:18,334 --> 01:00:19,438
Good night.

764
01:00:25,574 --> 01:00:26,575
Oh, Pete.

765
01:00:27,643 --> 01:00:29,282
Hello, Rosalinda.

766
01:00:29,846 --> 01:00:32,258
It's a beautiful
night, isn't it?

767
01:00:34,050 --> 01:00:36,155
- Mind if I join you?
- No.

768
01:00:36,853 --> 01:00:38,161
Not at all.

769
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,227
I wanna talk to you.

770
01:00:43,828 --> 01:00:45,205
What is it, Pete?

771
01:00:46,931 --> 01:00:49,969
That is, I have no
right to say this, but...

772
01:00:50,234 --> 01:00:54,580
Say it anyhow, Pete. It might
be something I'd like to hear.

773
01:00:56,107 --> 01:00:59,885
It's the money your father's spending.
They think it's coming from Davis.

774
01:00:59,945 --> 01:01:01,322
- From Phil?
- Yeah.

775
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:04,227
They say he's in love with you.

776
01:01:04,283 --> 01:01:06,524
You don't believe
that, do you, Pete?

777
01:01:06,585 --> 01:01:09,589
I can see how anyone might
get a wrong impression...

778
01:01:09,655 --> 01:01:11,601
about Phil and me, I mean.

779
01:01:11,657 --> 01:01:14,137
But there isn't anything
between us, Pete.

780
01:01:14,193 --> 01:01:17,835
I can't explain about the money,
because there isn't any explanation, but...

781
01:01:17,897 --> 01:01:19,740
There's no need for one...

782
01:01:20,767 --> 01:01:23,748
not about Davis, or the money...

783
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:26,143
or anything.

784
01:01:26,940 --> 01:01:28,544
Then, what is it, Pete?

785
01:01:29,442 --> 01:01:33,016
Why are we sitting here like
this, when all you have to say is...

786
01:01:49,364 --> 01:01:51,310
What's the use, Rosalinda?

787
01:01:52,534 --> 01:01:54,844
All right, suppose I
am in love with you.

788
01:01:55,103 --> 01:01:56,741
That's not enough.

789
01:01:57,506 --> 01:02:00,749
$2,000, plus more luck
than I dare hope for...

790
01:02:01,476 --> 01:02:03,616
and we might be able
to do something about it.

791
01:02:03,679 --> 01:02:05,886
A marriage license
only costs $2.

792
01:02:06,549 --> 01:02:08,392
Yeah, but how could we live?

793
01:02:09,151 --> 01:02:11,290
- We could manage.
- How?

794
01:02:12,021 --> 01:02:16,265
By putting windows in my tuba
and converting it into a Quonset hut?

795
01:02:17,093 --> 01:02:20,507
My mother and father didn't have
a penny when they were married.

796
01:02:20,564 --> 01:02:23,977
And Papa says that was the
happiest time in their whole lives.

797
01:02:25,669 --> 01:02:26,773
Very true.

798
01:02:28,605 --> 01:02:31,643
That's great. But I
can't even juggle.

799
01:02:32,576 --> 01:02:36,081
We'll have to take that up
the first thing in the morning.

800
01:02:37,448 --> 01:02:39,792
But why must we have $2,000?

801
01:02:39,884 --> 01:02:43,195
It's an oil deal, and
it might come in.

802
01:02:43,254 --> 01:02:46,133
Then again, it might
not. But if it did...

803
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:50,973
What's the use trying to
dream my way out of it?

804
01:02:52,364 --> 01:02:55,208
Pete, maybe Papa
can lend you the money.

805
01:02:56,335 --> 01:02:58,679
- Maybe.
- But $2,000?

806
01:02:59,371 --> 01:03:02,648
- You can ask him.
- I'm sorry, Rosalinda.

807
01:03:03,075 --> 01:03:07,115
I'm superstitious about borrowing
money that comes from heaven.

808
01:03:53,863 --> 01:03:55,240
Oh, Pete.

809
01:03:55,798 --> 01:03:57,300
Mr. Amendola.

810
01:03:59,102 --> 01:04:02,572
I couldn't help overhearing you
and Rosalinda talking out here.

811
01:04:02,839 --> 01:04:06,013
It's not that I was eavesdrooping,
or that I meant to listen.

812
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,886
I just had to get up and
fill the cold water bottle.

813
01:04:08,946 --> 01:04:11,290
You see, my feet
get very hot at night.

814
01:04:11,348 --> 01:04:13,259
I hope we didn't disturb you.

815
01:04:13,651 --> 01:04:17,963
What disturbs me is this idea you
got about Rosalinda and this guy Davis.

816
01:04:18,355 --> 01:04:20,460
Believe me,
there's nothing to it.

817
01:04:20,991 --> 01:04:23,768
Why, if you'd look with your
heart instead of your eyes...

818
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:26,399
you could see where
her best intentions are.

819
01:04:26,598 --> 01:04:30,273
Look, Mr. Amendola, it
isn't Rosalinda. It's me.

820
01:04:30,335 --> 01:04:34,545
Sure it's you. I heard what
you says about being broke.

821
01:04:34,639 --> 01:04:38,918
And if you ask me, I think your
get-up-and-go has got up and went.

822
01:04:39,378 --> 01:04:41,221
What you need is confidence.

823
01:04:41,814 --> 01:04:46,285
And listen. About that
$2,000, I'd be very glad to...

824
01:04:46,352 --> 01:04:48,832
I couldn't take your
money, Mr. Amendola.

825
01:04:49,221 --> 01:04:51,360
Of course, the oil
might come in...

826
01:04:51,557 --> 01:04:54,539
but right now, it's just a hole
in the ground in California.

827
01:04:54,594 --> 01:04:58,906
So what? Uncle Sam put
money in a hole in the ground...

828
01:04:58,965 --> 01:05:01,377
and it turned out
to be Fort Knox.

829
01:05:01,435 --> 01:05:03,540
And I can take a risk, too.

830
01:05:03,603 --> 01:05:06,174
But let's talk about
it in the morning.

831
01:05:13,081 --> 01:05:17,029
- Mama, where's Rosalinda?
- Went for a walk with the boy next door.

832
01:05:17,585 --> 01:05:21,192
You know, Papa, I think
that's getting serious.

833
01:05:21,255 --> 01:05:24,931
Serious? They might get
married and have a couple of kids.

834
01:05:25,194 --> 01:05:28,141
- But that's as far as it would go.
- Oh, Papa.

835
01:05:33,335 --> 01:05:36,009
Mama, remember this?

836
01:05:37,272 --> 01:05:38,273
Vaguely-

837
01:05:38,841 --> 01:05:42,949
Some boy who was courting me
used to sing it to me 22 years ago.

838
01:05:43,513 --> 01:05:45,390
Who was that, now?

839
01:05:45,715 --> 01:05:49,891
Was it the wealthy cattleman from
Montana, or that drummer from Boston?

840
01:05:50,286 --> 01:05:52,391
Mama, that was me.

841
01:05:53,389 --> 01:05:57,839
Of course it was, Papa. And I've been
singing myself to sleep with it ever since.

842
01:05:58,395 --> 01:05:59,669
Sing it, Papa.

843
01:06:17,649 --> 01:06:18,957
I remember.

844
01:07:12,974 --> 01:07:15,148
- Yes, gentlemen?
- We're not together.

845
01:07:15,211 --> 01:07:19,318
I'm Lieutenant Saunders, Police. I'm
looking for a man named Louis Amendola.

846
01:07:19,715 --> 01:07:20,750
That's me.

847
01:07:20,816 --> 01:07:23,353
I'm Inspector Tainey,
Bureau of Internal Revenue.

848
01:07:23,419 --> 01:07:25,228
- May I come in?
- Sure.

849
01:07:31,628 --> 01:07:34,404
- What did you do, Papa?
- I don't know.

850
01:07:34,631 --> 01:07:37,669
Unless I've been burning
the incinerator after-hours.

851
01:07:38,101 --> 01:07:40,445
Gentlemen, this is my wife.

852
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:45,548
Now all we need is the FBI.

853
01:07:47,044 --> 01:07:48,284
Pardon me.

854
01:07:51,082 --> 01:07:53,722
Callahan, FBI. Are
you Mr. Amendola?

855
01:07:53,951 --> 01:07:56,261
- Yes, sir. Won't you come in?
- Thanks.

856
01:08:00,191 --> 01:08:02,399
Me and my big, fat mouth.

857
01:08:09,902 --> 01:08:12,382
Mr. Amendola, I'd like to
ask you a few questions...

858
01:08:12,437 --> 01:08:14,678
Do you mind? I was here first.

859
01:08:15,173 --> 01:08:17,882
Mr. Amendola, the Department
of Internal Revenue...

860
01:08:17,944 --> 01:08:21,016
would like some information
regarding your source of income.

861
01:08:21,080 --> 01:08:22,684
- Income?
- A report...

862
01:08:22,749 --> 01:08:24,251
Please. May I?

863
01:08:24,684 --> 01:08:28,257
We have a report showing you've
been spending large sums of money...

864
01:08:28,321 --> 01:08:31,929
the source of which is not indicated
in your previous income-tax reports.

865
01:08:31,992 --> 01:08:36,168
We're a little curious, Mr. Amendola, to
know where the money is coming from.

866
01:08:36,330 --> 01:08:38,901
We saved a lot when we
were the Human Pyramid.

867
01:08:38,966 --> 01:08:41,640
And I took that money
and I invested it wisely.

868
01:08:41,936 --> 01:08:46,078
I'll have you know that I've majored
in Economics at Cranfus College.

869
01:08:46,140 --> 01:08:48,314
Cranfus? Never
heard of that college.

870
01:08:48,376 --> 01:08:51,220
That's like saying you
never heard of Joe Tupis.

871
01:08:51,279 --> 01:08:53,816
- Who's he?
- He's the President of Cranfus!

872
01:08:53,882 --> 01:08:56,954
Mr. Amendola, we're not
interested in your education.

873
01:08:57,052 --> 01:08:59,965
We just want to know where
you're getting the money.

874
01:09:01,289 --> 01:09:04,703
All right, gentlemen.
I'll tell you the truth.

875
01:09:05,795 --> 01:09:09,038
I'm the long lost son of
a very wealthy typhoon.

876
01:09:11,334 --> 01:09:15,578
When I was only two days old, a nurse
turned her back while changing me...

877
01:09:15,705 --> 01:09:19,176
and I was stolen from the cradle
by a band of starving gypsies.

878
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:25,425
A few months ago, the king of the gypsies
came and told me who my father was.

879
01:09:38,396 --> 01:09:40,205
I see you don't believe me.

880
01:09:40,999 --> 01:09:43,502
All right, I'll tell
you the truth.

881
01:09:50,042 --> 01:09:52,886
I was down at the beach,
digging with my pail and shovel...

882
01:09:52,945 --> 01:09:56,154
when suddenly my shovel struck
the top of an ironbound chest.

883
01:09:56,215 --> 01:09:58,627
- Pirates' treasure?
- That's right.

884
01:09:58,851 --> 01:10:03,027
That does it. Look here, Amendola,
you've been reported for everything...

885
01:10:03,088 --> 01:10:06,229
from swiping tires off baby
carriages to operating your own mint.

886
01:10:06,292 --> 01:10:08,863
- What's your racket?
- Leave him alone.

887
01:10:08,928 --> 01:10:13,138
Why can't we tell them the
truth, darling? It's so simple.

888
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:17,011
- All right, lady, what is the truth?
- Where does the money come from?

889
01:10:18,571 --> 01:10:20,380
From heaven.

890
01:10:24,979 --> 01:10:26,981
That explains everything.

891
01:10:27,415 --> 01:10:30,589
But it's the truth. It comes
straight from heaven.

892
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:34,565
- $1,500 every week.
- On the dot.

893
01:10:35,723 --> 01:10:38,671
I like the one about
the pirates' chest better.

894
01:10:39,428 --> 01:10:42,671
Come on, Amendola, let's go
and tell it to the boys at the station.

895
01:10:42,731 --> 01:10:45,075
But I can prove it. I
can prove every word...

896
01:10:45,133 --> 01:10:48,342
- Now, how can you prove it?
- It's easy.

897
01:10:48,470 --> 01:10:51,576
I put this old rocking chair
in the middle of the room...

898
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,780
sit down there, and
say a little prayer.

899
01:10:53,843 --> 01:10:57,017
And when I say,
"Rosalinda needs shoes..."

900
01:10:57,080 --> 01:10:59,151
The money comes down like rain.

901
01:10:59,215 --> 01:11:02,856
- All right, Mrs. Amendola, show us.
- Pull up the chair and say the prayer.

902
01:11:02,919 --> 01:11:05,331
Wait a minute. She
can't do it today.

903
01:11:05,421 --> 01:11:08,733
The miracle happens on
Thursday between 3:00 and 3:30.

904
01:11:10,661 --> 01:11:15,235
- We'll be here Thursday at 3:00.
- Thursday at 3:00.

905
01:11:28,179 --> 01:11:30,455
I should doubt my veracity.

906
01:11:42,761 --> 01:11:43,865
Look.

907
01:11:53,472 --> 01:11:56,317
And I hear they're both
doing tremendous business.

908
01:11:56,576 --> 01:11:59,284
They are? All right,
come on, let's go.

909
01:12:02,549 --> 01:12:03,653
Look.

910
01:12:14,929 --> 01:12:16,499
How's business, Mr. Molinari?

911
01:12:16,564 --> 01:12:19,340
Couldn't be better. More
orders than we can take care of.

912
01:12:19,400 --> 01:12:20,845
Come on, Katie, let's go.

913
01:12:20,902 --> 01:12:23,849
Clever man, that Amendola.
Soon he'll own the whole town.

914
01:12:23,905 --> 01:12:28,082
You could've done the same, if you'd
invested your money instead of hiding it.

915
01:12:29,178 --> 01:12:30,680
Marx and Amendola Garage.

916
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,453
- Look at that.
- No, I won't look!

917
01:12:33,515 --> 01:12:36,189
And don't stop every
second. I'm getting tired of this.

918
01:12:36,251 --> 01:12:40,222
You know what I'm gonna do? Lam
gonna raise Amendola's rent again.

919
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:41,926
As of today! Come on.

920
01:12:44,194 --> 01:12:48,074
Due to the increased cost of living,
I must raise the rent of this place.

921
01:12:48,131 --> 01:12:49,132
Again?

922
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:53,139
This is the eighth time you've
raised the rent since we moved in.

923
01:12:53,203 --> 01:12:56,013
You're forcing me to join
Landlords Anonymous.

924
01:12:56,507 --> 01:12:58,544
You can move out if you want to.

925
01:12:58,709 --> 01:13:01,053
Let's not be too
hasty, Mr. Dingle.

926
01:13:01,212 --> 01:13:04,591
You might be right. Maybe
the cost of living has increased.

927
01:13:04,949 --> 01:13:07,930
I wouldn't know, I haven't
done today's shopping yet.

928
01:13:08,786 --> 01:13:10,527
How much more do you want?

929
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:16,796
- $30.
- $30? $125 a month? Why, it's robbery!

930
01:13:16,928 --> 01:13:19,306
If you think that, you can
start packing right now.

931
01:13:19,364 --> 01:13:21,776
He didn't mean that,
Mr. Dingle. Did you, Papa?

932
01:13:21,833 --> 01:13:23,107
Of course not.

933
01:13:23,602 --> 01:13:25,445
I apologize, Mr. Dingle.

934
01:13:25,704 --> 01:13:29,346
Why, for only $125 a month,
where else could you find a place...

935
01:13:29,408 --> 01:13:32,446
where the sunshine comes
streaming through the keyhole all day?

936
01:13:32,511 --> 01:13:34,616
You're right. You can't
take advantage of me...

937
01:13:34,680 --> 01:13:38,093
- like those bankrupt shop owners.
- Now, look here.

938
01:13:38,150 --> 01:13:40,721
I only helped them out
because no one else would.

939
01:13:40,786 --> 01:13:44,166
And besides, I'm not making
money on all those investments.

940
01:13:44,358 --> 01:13:46,634
For instance, your
son's oil venture.

941
01:13:46,793 --> 01:13:49,569
I'll surely lose the
$2,000 I invested in that.

942
01:13:50,063 --> 01:13:52,942
You deserve to. He
couldn't take me for a sucker.

943
01:13:53,033 --> 01:13:55,809
- I wouldn't give him a nickel.
- If you did...

944
01:13:55,869 --> 01:13:58,783
you'd probably shortchange
him, you tight old buzzard.

945
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:02,686
That's done it. Another word out of
you, and I'll punch you in the nose!

946
01:14:02,744 --> 01:14:06,317
- Why, I'll...
- Papa! Mr. Dingle!

947
01:14:06,381 --> 01:14:10,295
Why, you two should be friends,
if only for our children's sake.

948
01:14:10,351 --> 01:14:12,228
They love one another.

949
01:14:12,420 --> 01:14:15,061
Who knows? They might
get married someday.

950
01:14:15,124 --> 01:14:19,869
No son of mine will ever marry a
girl with your daughter's reputation.

951
01:14:19,962 --> 01:14:21,669
Get out!

952
01:14:24,233 --> 01:14:26,008
Papa, the chair.

953
01:14:26,235 --> 01:14:28,681
- It's broken.
- Get me some nails and glue.

954
01:14:28,737 --> 01:14:31,446
I'll fix it. Hurry! It's
almost time to pray.

955
01:14:54,765 --> 01:14:58,269
"We are sorry to
inform you that..."

956
01:14:59,737 --> 01:15:00,943
Katie!

957
01:15:03,709 --> 01:15:04,847
Yes, Frank?

958
01:15:06,712 --> 01:15:08,817
Our gold mine is exhausted.

959
01:15:09,381 --> 01:15:11,554
There'll be no more checks.

960
01:15:16,889 --> 01:15:20,427
- Let's get going. It's almost 3:30.
- Okay.

961
01:15:24,597 --> 01:15:26,235
All right, Mama.

962
01:15:28,668 --> 01:15:29,874
Say it.

963
01:15:31,871 --> 01:15:33,783
Rosalinda needs shoes.

964
01:15:40,247 --> 01:15:43,194
- Look...
- Gentlemen, a little patience.

965
01:15:43,450 --> 01:15:47,364
$1, 500 is a lot of money.
Sometimes we gotta ask twice.

966
01:15:48,923 --> 01:15:50,527
Try it again, Mama.

967
01:15:53,828 --> 01:15:55,739
Rosalinda needs shoes.

968
01:15:58,933 --> 01:16:00,344
Once again.

969
01:16:02,637 --> 01:16:06,586
Rosalinda needs shoes.

970
01:16:11,847 --> 01:16:13,656
I guess you're right, Mama.

971
01:16:14,717 --> 01:16:16,628
It seems the miracle is over.

972
01:16:21,925 --> 01:16:25,805
I threw away $1,500 a
week when I threw this chair.

973
01:16:26,596 --> 01:16:28,041
It's not the chair.

974
01:16:28,231 --> 01:16:31,610
It's that we have no
excuse to ask for any more.

975
01:16:32,235 --> 01:16:35,740
You're right. But we're
doing all right, now.

976
01:16:36,207 --> 01:16:38,687
There's a lot of poor
people praying in this world.

977
01:16:38,743 --> 01:16:40,848
Now ifs their tum for miracles.

978
01:17:02,134 --> 01:17:04,808
I'm moving out of here the
first thing tomorrow morning.

979
01:17:04,870 --> 01:17:07,317
Now even my cigarettes
don't come down.

980
01:17:07,373 --> 01:17:10,377
I'm afraid you won't
have to wait till then.

981
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:12,650
You'll have to move
now, down to the station.

982
01:17:12,712 --> 01:17:15,750
Not so fast, Lieutenant. This is
a tax matter. He goes with me.

983
01:17:15,815 --> 01:17:19,126
Wait a minute, you two. I don't
know what kind of a matter this is...

984
01:17:19,185 --> 01:17:21,131
but he's going with
me for questioning.

985
01:17:21,187 --> 01:17:24,601
- Question him at the station.
- I don't want to.

986
01:17:24,692 --> 01:17:26,535
I want to question
him at my field office.

987
01:17:26,594 --> 01:17:29,370
I don't care where you question
him. He's going with me now.

988
01:17:29,430 --> 01:17:31,501
Over my broken
and splintered body.

989
01:17:31,565 --> 01:17:35,513
I have no objection to taking him
over your broken and splintered body.

990
01:17:35,569 --> 01:17:39,040
Gentlemen, let's have
cooperation. Let him go with me.

991
01:17:40,141 --> 01:17:41,518
Good night, Pete.

992
01:17:43,044 --> 01:17:44,785
Good night, Rosalinda.

993
01:17:48,316 --> 01:17:50,592
Mama, Papa, what's the matter?

994
01:17:50,652 --> 01:17:54,760
These people don't understand
where we're getting our money from.

995
01:17:54,824 --> 01:17:58,465
So I'm going downtown and
explaining it. You stay here with Mother.

996
01:17:58,828 --> 01:18:00,637
Is there anything I can do?

997
01:18:02,131 --> 01:18:04,042
Pardon us a moment, will you?

998
01:18:05,468 --> 01:18:08,348
Look, I don't know how
long I'm gonna be gone.

999
01:18:08,906 --> 01:18:11,614
Kinda keep an eye on
things till I get back, will you?

1000
01:18:11,742 --> 01:18:14,848
Sure. But there's
trouble. Is it serious?

1001
01:18:14,945 --> 01:18:16,583
There's nothing to it.

1002
01:18:16,647 --> 01:18:20,060
With time off for good
behavior, I may only get life.

1003
01:18:21,351 --> 01:18:24,333
- All right, gentlemen, whose car do I go in?
- Mine.

1004
01:18:27,659 --> 01:18:29,104
I smell smoke.

1005
01:18:29,961 --> 01:18:30,962
So do I.

1006
01:18:35,166 --> 01:18:39,377
But, Dad, Mr. Amendola's in serious
trouble. Maybe the $2,000 would help him.

1007
01:18:39,605 --> 01:18:42,108
- You've got to give it to him.
- I think you should.

1008
01:18:42,174 --> 01:18:44,450
- He helped Pete.
- Helped him how?

1009
01:18:44,510 --> 01:18:47,218
To make an idiot out of
himself by giving him $2,000".

1010
01:18:47,279 --> 01:18:49,987
For that crook
Mulligan. I won't do it!

1011
01:18:50,049 --> 01:18:52,154
I won't give Amendola one penny.

1012
01:18:52,217 --> 01:18:54,697
Let him fry in his own
fat. He belongs in jail.

1013
01:18:54,753 --> 01:18:56,563
But, Dad, this is important.

1014
01:18:56,756 --> 01:18:59,236
Frank, you're a hard-hearted,
money-hoarding...

1015
01:18:59,326 --> 01:19:03,138
I'm going upstairs, where I don't
have to listen to either one of you.

1016
01:19:13,107 --> 01:19:16,350
Help! I'm choking!

1017
01:19:20,548 --> 01:19:21,822
Don't worry, Dad.

1018
01:19:21,882 --> 01:19:23,088
Come on, Dad.

1019
01:19:23,951 --> 01:19:26,262
- I gotta get my money!
- Forget your money.

1020
01:19:26,321 --> 01:19:28,267
It's in a hole behind the bed.

1021
01:19:30,258 --> 01:19:31,965
Mom, I've got him.

1022
01:19:32,761 --> 01:19:35,298
The money! I want
to get the money!

1023
01:19:35,530 --> 01:19:36,804
Let me go!

1024
01:19:53,082 --> 01:19:57,657
The polar bear rug with the radio!
I'll miss The Jimmy Durante Show.

1025
01:19:57,721 --> 01:19:58,893
Here it is, Papa!

1026
01:20:40,566 --> 01:20:44,538
- Thousands of dollars. It's all gone.
- Heaven knows you deserve it.

1027
01:20:44,604 --> 01:20:45,912
Are we insured, Pa?

1028
01:20:46,006 --> 01:20:49,044
Heck, no. Those chiselers
don't get any of my money, no sir.

1029
01:20:50,077 --> 01:20:51,988
Good heavens, I'm not insured!

1030
01:20:53,814 --> 01:20:57,853
You have a very smart father. He
trusts nobody but the hole behind the bed.

1031
01:20:59,319 --> 01:21:01,391
Pete, I'm so glad
you're all right.

1032
01:21:01,456 --> 01:21:06,269
Thousands of dollars burning right
now. Brand-new, crisp $100 bills.

1033
01:21:06,327 --> 01:21:08,432
He put them in a
hole behind his bed.

1034
01:21:08,496 --> 01:21:12,603
Every Thursday,
$1,500. Now it's all gone.

1035
01:21:20,442 --> 01:21:22,217
"Rosalinda needs shoes"?

1036
01:21:26,782 --> 01:21:28,853
Pull yourself
together, Mr. Dingle.

1037
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,797
HI rebuild the house.
It'll be better than new.

1038
01:21:32,288 --> 01:21:35,394
- You will?
- I don't know what to say.

1039
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:37,734
It's perfectly all
right, Mrs. Dingle.

1040
01:21:37,961 --> 01:21:40,373
Why, anything to
help a good neighbor.

1041
01:21:43,633 --> 01:21:47,104
The way I see it, now this is
very definitely only a tax matter.

1042
01:21:47,171 --> 01:21:49,777
- This makes things much simpler.
- What do you mean?

1043
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:52,343
Who owes the tax?
Amendola, or this other guy?

1044
01:21:52,409 --> 01:21:54,013
Naturally, the...

1045
01:21:55,212 --> 01:21:58,716
I guess Amendola. I don't
know. They both had incomes.

1046
01:21:58,816 --> 01:22:02,458
- Maybe they both owe us.
- How? It was this other fellow's income.

1047
01:22:02,521 --> 01:22:06,059
Sure. Amendola was only
innocently using the other guy's money.

1048
01:22:06,424 --> 01:22:07,903
It was like a gift.

1049
01:22:08,059 --> 01:22:12,633
In that case, this man not only owes income
tax, he'll have to pay us gift tax, too.

1050
01:22:12,898 --> 01:22:16,345
As far as I'm concerned, the
local law is no longer interested.

1051
01:22:16,401 --> 01:22:18,541
Looks like it's out of
my jurisdiction, too.

1052
01:22:18,604 --> 01:22:22,746
It's too involved for me. I'm
gonna forget all about till March 15.

1053
01:22:24,977 --> 01:22:27,787
- What did you find?
- Nothing but a dead squirrel.

1054
01:22:30,016 --> 01:22:33,931
He isn't dead. He's just overcome by
smoke. All he needs is a little fresh air.

1055
01:22:33,987 --> 01:22:36,297
Wonder what he was
doing in the house.

1056
01:22:42,396 --> 01:22:45,172
That's the place for
a little squirrel to be.

1057
01:22:53,942 --> 01:22:55,979
- Thanks for the lift.
- Okay.

1058
01:23:07,156 --> 01:23:08,157
Rupert.

1059
01:23:10,793 --> 01:23:11,794
Rupert.

1060
01:23:52,471 --> 01:23:54,610
My good old Rupert.

1061
01:23:55,707 --> 01:23:57,778
You haven't changed a bit.

1062
01:23:58,777 --> 01:24:02,224
You smell a little smoky,
though. Now, tell me, how was it?

1063
01:24:02,481 --> 01:24:06,019
How did the other squirrels
treat you? Were they good?

1064
01:24:07,053 --> 01:24:08,532
I've got good news for you.

1065
01:24:08,588 --> 01:24:11,762
I got a job with a circus, and
we start in two weeks in Hoboken.

1066
01:24:11,824 --> 01:24:13,804
Me and two seals.

1067
01:25:07,750 --> 01:25:11,324
- Greetings, Mr. and Mrs. Dingle.
- Mr. Amendola.

1068
01:25:11,388 --> 01:25:14,028
- For your new home, Mrs. Dingle.
- Thank you.

1069
01:25:14,324 --> 01:25:16,565
- Go ahead, Papa.
- Make your speech.

1070
01:25:17,861 --> 01:25:18,862
Mr. Dingle...

1071
01:25:19,363 --> 01:25:21,707
like a caterpillar
has its cocoon...

1072
01:25:21,932 --> 01:25:24,105
like a bird has its nest...

1073
01:25:24,634 --> 01:25:26,945
like the worm has its...

1074
01:25:29,574 --> 01:25:31,554
apple, believe me...

1075
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:35,318
it's a pleasure to present you
with the key to your new home.

1076
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:37,724
Mr. Amendola...

1077
01:25:38,182 --> 01:25:40,925
you're the finest, the
noblest, the most generous...

1078
01:25:41,020 --> 01:25:43,125
I wouldn't say that, Mr. Dingle.

1079
01:25:43,188 --> 01:25:44,929
But I'm glad he did.

1080
01:25:45,357 --> 01:25:48,531
I'm overwhelmed. I
can't find words enough...

1081
01:25:48,594 --> 01:25:51,040
Words. What are words?

1082
01:25:51,096 --> 01:25:55,306
If it'll make you any happier, I'll
even carry you across the threshold.

1083
01:25:55,367 --> 01:25:57,370
Thank you, Mr. Amendola.

1084
01:26:11,852 --> 01:26:13,763
Our old home, Frank.

1085
01:26:18,125 --> 01:26:21,470
- And it's nicer than before.
- I'm glad you like it.

1086
01:26:21,862 --> 01:26:26,368
My little wife crocheted the doilies, but
I'll have to take credit for the curtains.

1087
01:26:26,700 --> 01:26:30,478
I would have done a much better
job, only my pinking shears were dull.

1088
01:26:33,341 --> 01:26:34,979
- Pete.
- Mulligan.

1089
01:26:35,410 --> 01:26:38,516
- Why, you dirty, double-crossing...
- No, wait a minute.

1090
01:26:39,314 --> 01:26:40,384
Let me go.

1091
01:26:40,482 --> 01:26:42,963
We're rich, Pete! The
oil is coming like a geyser.

1092
01:26:43,019 --> 01:26:44,760
What? The well came in?

1093
01:26:46,556 --> 01:26:48,467
Rosie, come down here, quick!

1094
01:26:48,558 --> 01:26:49,559
Phil.

1095
01:26:58,101 --> 01:26:59,945
You don't mean it, Phil?

1096
01:27:00,003 --> 01:27:01,949
Hey, look here, Davis!

1097
01:27:02,639 --> 01:27:05,620
Pete, listen. It's your
music. Phil just told me.

1098
01:27:05,676 --> 01:27:08,452
- What is it?
- Be quiet and listen to the radio.

1099
01:27:08,512 --> 01:27:11,789
The Melody for Two Orphaned
Instruments by Peter Dingle.

1100
01:27:18,256 --> 01:27:20,258
You did this, Rosalinda.

1101
01:27:21,226 --> 01:27:23,467
You see what! Mean
about taking a risk?

1102
01:27:23,528 --> 01:27:27,340
Speaking of risks, Pete, when
are you gonna ask me to marry you?

1103
01:27:27,432 --> 01:27:28,706
Right now.

1104
01:27:29,502 --> 01:27:31,243
They're gonna get married.

1105
01:27:32,805 --> 01:27:34,113
Rosalinda.

1106
01:27:34,573 --> 01:27:35,813
Pete!

1107
01:27:36,942 --> 01:27:41,118
- Amendola, my friend.
- Dingle, old pal.
