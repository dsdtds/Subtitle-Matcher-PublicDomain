1
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:07,000

2
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000

3
00:01:23,839 --> 00:01:25,507
[bell tolling]

4
00:02:01,209 --> 00:02:03,086
New one, isn't she, Albert?

5
00:02:03,462 --> 00:02:05,881
Must be, or she wouldn't be out
on a night like this.

6
00:02:06,381 --> 00:02:07,633
No weather for a dog.

7
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:09,885
Nor for no cat, neither.

8
00:02:11,094 --> 00:02:12,471
[bell continues tolling]

9
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:57,808
Ah.

10
00:03:12,572 --> 00:03:14,616
Too gloomy, Dobbs. Too gloomy.

11
00:03:14,783 --> 00:03:15,992
Much too severe.

12
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:18,245
Sorry, sir. One does one's best.

13
00:03:18,412 --> 00:03:21,832
Oh, quite.
Just take away the ship thing, will you?

14
00:03:24,584 --> 00:03:27,921
More, uh, more vivacity is needed.

15
00:03:28,088 --> 00:03:30,841
Chaste, yes, certainly, Dobbs,
but not funereal.

16
00:03:31,174 --> 00:03:32,008
Ah.

17
00:03:33,635 --> 00:03:34,553
Here we are.

18
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,640
The, uh, deft feminine touch, Dobbs.

19
00:03:39,307 --> 00:03:40,517
[chuckles]

20
00:03:45,522 --> 00:03:47,733
You've taken the wine
from my pet bin, haven't you?

21
00:03:47,899 --> 00:03:48,775
The very best.

22
00:03:48,942 --> 00:03:51,278
Yes, well, the best is none too good
for the occasion.

23
00:03:51,862 --> 00:03:54,448
Now, just see to the aperitifs, will you?

24
00:03:59,453 --> 00:04:03,957
Dobbs! Really, you're...
You're downright Victorian.

25
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:07,294
We must have cocktails, Dobbs. Cocktails!

26
00:04:09,045 --> 00:04:11,965
[shocked] Not cocktails, sir.

27
00:04:12,132 --> 00:04:15,635
Yes! Now, don't tell me
that it isn't British.

28
00:04:15,802 --> 00:04:17,763
You're deplorably behind the times.

29
00:04:19,014 --> 00:04:20,432
I drink 'em myself.

30
00:04:21,016 --> 00:04:22,309
And what's more, I can mix 'em.

31
00:04:23,226 --> 00:04:24,478
"Mix" is the word.

32
00:04:26,438 --> 00:04:29,858
They tell me they even
put ice in them in America.

33
00:04:30,025 --> 00:04:33,361
Yes, well, uh,
I don't think we'll go quite that far.

34
00:04:43,163 --> 00:04:46,291
Waltz to it, darling.
I don't fancy freezing my dainty shape

35
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,835
while you ask Papa
permission to come out and play.

36
00:04:49,002 --> 00:04:51,129
[chuckles] Back in a tick, Berthine.

37
00:05:03,975 --> 00:05:05,143
Mind, Dobbs.

38
00:05:06,311 --> 00:05:09,981
Not a word that we haven't seen him
for a fortnight.

39
00:05:14,486 --> 00:05:18,114
Well, Russell, my boy.
Welcome to the family hearth.

40
00:05:18,281 --> 00:05:20,575
- Hello, Father.
- Nasty night out, eh?

41
00:05:20,742 --> 00:05:21,952
- What a fog!
- Yeah.

42
00:05:22,118 --> 00:05:24,746
- Thicker than mutton broth. Hello, Dobbs!
-[laughs]

43
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,957
How's the old aches and twinges
this weather?

44
00:05:27,123 --> 00:05:27,958
Thank you, sir.

45
00:05:28,124 --> 00:05:30,794
[Sir Gerald] Awfully nice of you'
my boy, to dare the fog,

46
00:05:30,961 --> 00:05:33,630
just for an evening
with your aged male parent.

47
00:05:33,797 --> 00:05:35,215
[Russell]
There is nothing I'd like better.

48
00:05:35,382 --> 00:05:37,300
Meanwhile, what price a cocktail?

49
00:05:37,467 --> 00:05:41,012
Yes. Dobbs was shocked at that... Dobbs...

50
00:05:41,471 --> 00:05:45,475
Where is the old training?
Take Mr. Russell's coat and hat.

51
00:05:49,563 --> 00:05:52,274
You're surprised, aren't you,
that I know about cocktails?

52
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,111
You know, I learned
from a barman at The Savoy.

53
00:05:56,278 --> 00:05:58,113
He used to live in Chicago.

54
00:05:58,572 --> 00:05:59,364
Allow me, sir.

55
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:00,699
Thanks, Dobbs, but don't bother.

56
00:06:00,866 --> 00:06:02,450
I've got to be popping off directly.

57
00:06:09,249 --> 00:06:11,376
You're not stopping for dinner, then?

58
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,881
I'm terribly sorry, Father, but, uh'
when I promised you to come,

59
00:06:16,047 --> 00:06:17,424
I overlooked another engagement.

60
00:06:17,924 --> 00:06:21,094
Well, it's, uh,
it's quite all right, of course.

61
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,223
Only I'd hoped, uh...

62
00:06:26,683 --> 00:06:29,311
Well, it can't be helped, can it?

63
00:06:30,061 --> 00:06:33,189
I mean to say, one does have
other engagements, of course.

64
00:06:33,815 --> 00:06:35,817
I know it seems fairly awful.

65
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:38,361
Let's have luncheon together tomorrow.

66
00:06:39,112 --> 00:06:41,156
We'll have a good, old-fashioned reunion.

67
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,159
And you can scold me
in the good, old-fashioned way.

68
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:49,581
-[soft laugh]
- Meanwhile, as you suggest,

69
00:06:49,748 --> 00:06:51,708
what price the merry old cocktail?

70
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:56,963
Gentlemen, I give you Sir Gerald Courtney,

71
00:06:57,130 --> 00:07:00,467
my father, and a jolly good sportsman.

72
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:01,968
Thank you.

73
00:07:04,387 --> 00:07:06,264
Mmm! I say!

74
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:08,767
- You do know something about cocktails.
- Hmm.

75
00:07:08,934 --> 00:07:10,727
Was that chap from Chicago, did you say?

76
00:07:10,894 --> 00:07:12,687
Yeah. One of the survivors.

77
00:07:12,854 --> 00:07:14,898
[laughs] One of the survivors.

78
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:16,858
You know, that's a fruity joke.

79
00:07:17,567 --> 00:07:19,277
Is your engagement tonight with...

80
00:07:19,444 --> 00:07:22,072
Ah, ah. Save the scolding for tomorrow.

81
00:07:22,656 --> 00:07:25,116
Like a good fella. Won't you?

82
00:07:28,203 --> 00:07:30,914
I wish we could talk
things out together, my boy.

83
00:07:31,081 --> 00:07:33,249
Tomorrow! At luncheon.

84
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:36,461
Ah! We'll both make after-dinner speeches.

85
00:07:38,797 --> 00:07:41,800
[chuckles] Right. Tomorrow, then.

86
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,010
One o'clock. Pronto.

87
00:07:48,682 --> 00:07:52,435
Uh, and I'll be toddling along, sir,
if you don't mind.

88
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:54,980
Good night, Father.

89
00:07:55,146 --> 00:07:56,189
Good night, my boy.

90
00:07:59,192 --> 00:08:00,318
Mind the fog.

91
00:08:00,819 --> 00:08:01,987
Right you are.

92
00:08:12,288 --> 00:08:14,290
It was more like a tick and a half.

93
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,086
Did Papa let his little boy
come out to play with bad little girl?

94
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:19,754
[laughs] Chuck it, Berthine.

95
00:08:20,213 --> 00:08:23,049
To The Pigeon Pie, old chum,
and don't spare the carburetor.

96
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,433
[horn honks]

97
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:32,892
[tires squeal]

98
00:08:59,502 --> 00:09:04,132
[footsteps]

99
00:09:13,308 --> 00:09:14,809
[doorbell dings]

100
00:09:21,357 --> 00:09:23,109
[urgent knocking]

101
00:09:27,697 --> 00:09:29,407
Oh, please! They're after me.

102
00:09:29,574 --> 00:09:30,784
I'll explain later.

103
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:36,289
My dear girl! We were worried about you.

104
00:09:36,456 --> 00:09:38,249
Tramping about in this fog?

105
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,877
Why on earth didn't you take a taxi?

106
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:43,421
Yes, well, officers, what is it?

107
00:09:43,588 --> 00:09:45,423
Come, come. What's all this about?

108
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:47,675
You see, sir, uh, we thought she was a...

109
00:09:47,842 --> 00:09:50,345
[clears throat]
We thought, My Lord, that she...

110
00:09:50,512 --> 00:09:54,557
that is, we thought... I mean, uh,
we thought that she got lost in the fog.

111
00:09:54,724 --> 00:09:57,310
- Uh, didn't we, Albert?
- Oh, yes, sir. Lost in the fog.

112
00:09:57,477 --> 00:09:58,645
That's what we thought.

113
00:09:58,812 --> 00:10:00,939
My niece? Lost in a little mist?

114
00:10:01,106 --> 00:10:02,690
[chuckles] Not this young lady.

115
00:10:03,024 --> 00:10:05,318
However, my dear,
you should have taken a taxi.

116
00:10:05,485 --> 00:10:07,362
If you had telephoned,
we would have sent the car for you.

117
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,781
Hurry, now. Get out of this wet coat.

118
00:10:10,156 --> 00:10:12,992
Dobbs has kept dinner waiting,
and you know Dobbs.

119
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:16,329
- Good old Dobbs.
- Uh, yes. Quite so. Good old Dobbs.

120
00:10:16,496 --> 00:10:17,747
Thanks so much.

121
00:10:17,914 --> 00:10:19,624
Wouldn't have troubled you for the world.

122
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:25,547
Good night, officers.
You've been, uh, commendably vigilant.

123
00:10:25,713 --> 00:10:27,340
- Good night.
- Thank you, sir.

124
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:32,137
His niece. Sir Gerald Courtney's niece.

125
00:10:32,595 --> 00:10:35,431
- And us thinking she was nothing but a--
- Shh!

126
00:10:35,598 --> 00:10:37,392
Stow that, Albert. Stow it, mate.

127
00:10:39,644 --> 00:10:40,895
[sighs]

128
00:10:41,688 --> 00:10:43,148
Better rest a moment.

129
00:10:44,107 --> 00:10:45,608
Rather, if you don't mind.

130
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:48,361
Just until Albert and his pal clear off.

131
00:10:56,411 --> 00:10:57,495
Sit down here.

132
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:13,469
I knew my purse leaked,

133
00:11:14,387 --> 00:11:16,764
but rain is the only thing
that ever leaked into it.

134
00:11:17,056 --> 00:11:18,266
Try one of these.

135
00:11:22,896 --> 00:11:25,356
Probably give me the gout
after these gaspers I'm used to.

136
00:11:25,523 --> 00:11:26,399
[chuckles]

137
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,944
Oh, blimey. A short life, and a merry one.

138
00:11:30,111 --> 00:11:30,904
Yes.

139
00:11:37,785 --> 00:11:39,287
No use trying to thank you.

140
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:41,873
It was wonderfully sporting of you

141
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:43,333
to take a chance on me,

142
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:46,252
a stranger off the streets.

143
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:49,255
Oh, I say, that's rather
an ugly way of putting it...

144
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:50,673
"off the streets."

145
00:11:51,841 --> 00:11:53,009
Why did you do it?

146
00:11:53,676 --> 00:11:57,222
Well, you looked lonely
and a bit frightened,

147
00:11:57,388 --> 00:12:00,099
and it just happens that, uh, I am, too.

148
00:12:00,892 --> 00:12:03,561
- You, lonely and scared?
- Yes.

149
00:12:04,187 --> 00:12:05,939
That's about as true
as that I'm your niece.

150
00:12:06,105 --> 00:12:08,566
Rather neat, wasn't it,
that thought about the niece?

151
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,944
- And good old Dobbs.
- Dobbs is a fact.

152
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:14,614
Oh, quite a fact.
Ah, Dobbs himself.

153
00:12:15,073 --> 00:12:16,950
I simply can't believe it.

154
00:12:17,116 --> 00:12:18,243
Word of honor.

155
00:12:18,868 --> 00:12:20,453
Is, uh, dinner served, Dobbs?

156
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:21,871
Yes, sir. Hmm.

157
00:12:23,581 --> 00:12:25,959
Oh, but you're not going?

158
00:12:26,334 --> 00:12:29,295
Have you forgotten
that we waited dinner for you?

159
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,715
Albert and his friend will be gone by now.

160
00:12:33,466 --> 00:12:36,511
Oh, but I... I mean it. Really.

161
00:12:36,928 --> 00:12:38,304
I want you to stay.

162
00:12:40,640 --> 00:12:43,726
In a way, you know,
you rather owe it to me.

163
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:46,145
Will you?

164
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:48,856
Why not?

165
00:12:49,023 --> 00:12:50,108
"Why not?" indeed.

166
00:12:51,192 --> 00:12:53,278
You, uh, hear what
the young lady says, Dobbs.

167
00:12:53,444 --> 00:12:54,696
Why not, sir...

168
00:12:55,113 --> 00:12:56,197
Uh, quite.

169
00:12:56,739 --> 00:12:58,658
And you might just give us a hand here.

170
00:12:59,325 --> 00:13:02,120
Let me help you with that coat... niece.

171
00:13:03,246 --> 00:13:04,580
Thank you... uncle.

172
00:13:04,747 --> 00:13:05,915
[Sir Gerald laughs]

173
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,644
You've been disappointed, haven't you?

174
00:13:26,811 --> 00:13:30,315
I? Oh, not a bit of it.
You fit perfectly.

175
00:13:30,481 --> 00:13:31,357
Really.

176
00:13:32,608 --> 00:13:33,901
I don't mean me.

177
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,529
Fish and chips is more my style.

178
00:13:37,572 --> 00:13:40,158
But, I mean the lady
you were expecting to dinner.

179
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:43,828
But I wasn't expecting a lady.

180
00:13:44,996 --> 00:13:46,414
No. Really.

181
00:13:47,498 --> 00:13:49,792
As a matter of fact,
I was expecting a man.

182
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:54,255
A young man that I am rather fond of.

183
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:01,554
[lively chatter]

184
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:03,348
[man] Freddy! Freddy!

185
00:14:06,517 --> 00:14:08,186
Oh! Wait!

186
00:14:10,104 --> 00:14:11,439
Oh, Russell!

187
00:14:15,568 --> 00:14:17,779
Time for your drops, old girl.

188
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:21,199
Darling!
Still fretting 'cause his papa was cross?

189
00:14:21,366 --> 00:14:25,244
Don't be ridic. Never gave
the old governor a second thought.

190
00:14:28,664 --> 00:14:30,416
Get your hands off me, you ape!

191
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:32,043
Nikolai wants a drink, darling.

192
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,629
Like a shot! No sooner said than done.

193
00:14:34,796 --> 00:14:38,132
Good old Nikolai Rabinovich,'
chum of my childhood days.

194
00:14:38,299 --> 00:14:39,634
No, thank you, my good friend.

195
00:14:39,801 --> 00:14:42,345
Come, come, Nicky. No sulking!

196
00:14:42,512 --> 00:14:45,181
If he won't, I will,
and with a certain amount of dash!

197
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:47,975
-[laughs] Attaboy!
- Whoa! That's enough.

198
00:14:48,142 --> 00:14:49,519
There we are!

199
00:14:50,645 --> 00:14:51,979
You know what would
do your governor good?

200
00:14:52,146 --> 00:14:54,107
To get out himself
for a binge now and then.

201
00:14:54,565 --> 00:14:56,067
You don't know my father.

202
00:14:56,234 --> 00:14:57,735
He's a man, isn't he?

203
00:14:57,902 --> 00:15:00,405
The trouble is he forgets
how it was when he was a lad.

204
00:15:01,114 --> 00:15:03,074
He still thinks I'm a schoolboy.

205
00:15:03,658 --> 00:15:05,785
He'll let me have it tomorrow at luncheon.

206
00:15:06,369 --> 00:15:10,957
But, darling! You're having luncheon
with me at my flat.

207
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:14,293
Little boy, rather have
a scolding from his papa

208
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:17,630
than a cozy little, chummy little...?

209
00:15:24,554 --> 00:15:26,180
Pardon me, Nikolai, won't you?

210
00:15:34,897 --> 00:15:36,482
[sighs]

211
00:15:37,608 --> 00:15:38,901
[softly] I gotta go...

212
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:50,288
Nikolai, you're a fool.
You can't act this way.

213
00:15:50,455 --> 00:15:52,331
You will tell me what I can do?

214
00:15:52,498 --> 00:15:53,916
You're just jealous!

215
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,460
Certainly I am jealous.

216
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:57,211
Quit it, will ya?
I'm not in love with him.

217
00:15:57,378 --> 00:16:00,506
Of course not.
How could you be when you have me?

218
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:03,176
But don't forget you have me.

219
00:16:03,342 --> 00:16:04,844
He's got money, Nikolai.

220
00:16:05,011 --> 00:16:07,763
That is, his old man's got money.
Bags of it.

221
00:16:08,473 --> 00:16:09,849
Lot of good it will do you if I--

222
00:16:10,016 --> 00:16:11,934
You'll be looking
for your share, won't you?

223
00:16:12,101 --> 00:16:13,478
And I will get it.

224
00:16:13,644 --> 00:16:15,188
Always have, haven't you?

225
00:16:15,354 --> 00:16:16,647
Always, my dear.

226
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:20,193
I have been talking.

227
00:16:20,818 --> 00:16:23,362
Telling the story of my life,
you might say.

228
00:16:23,571 --> 00:16:25,239
- Yes?
- Excuse me, Sir Gerald.

229
00:16:25,531 --> 00:16:29,160
I, uh-- That is, he just telephoned, sir.

230
00:16:29,327 --> 00:16:31,204
Oh, yes, yes. I'll speak to him.

231
00:16:34,540 --> 00:16:35,500
He didn't wait, sir.

232
00:16:36,584 --> 00:16:37,418
He, uh...

233
00:16:38,169 --> 00:16:39,504
He gave me a message.

234
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:43,132
He said that, uh, he couldn't have
luncheon with you tomorrow.

235
00:16:43,508 --> 00:16:44,634
I see.

236
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,179
Uh, thank you, Dobbs.

237
00:16:56,103 --> 00:16:57,355
Disappointed again?

238
00:16:57,939 --> 00:16:59,482
Eh? Oh.

239
00:17:00,149 --> 00:17:01,067
By the boy?

240
00:17:02,235 --> 00:17:03,736
The one you were telling me
about at dinner?

241
00:17:04,111 --> 00:17:05,780
Oh, I hate to see him do it.

242
00:17:05,947 --> 00:17:07,448
It's not the drink
or all the women.

243
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,784
A few wild oats are indicated
for a young man,

244
00:17:09,951 --> 00:17:11,494
but this woman... ugh!

245
00:17:12,453 --> 00:17:14,914
You know, he could become
a really great architect.

246
00:17:15,081 --> 00:17:17,041
There's a touch of genius in his drawings.

247
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:19,627
Why, do you know,
even when he was a little chap, he...

248
00:17:20,086 --> 00:17:21,128
I'm sorry.

249
00:17:22,129 --> 00:17:23,714
You are fond of him, aren't you?

250
00:17:24,257 --> 00:17:27,051
We've been the best of comrades, always.

251
00:17:27,593 --> 00:17:30,096
And now there seems to be
a barrier between us.

252
00:17:30,263 --> 00:17:32,098
We can't even talk things out.

253
00:17:33,140 --> 00:17:36,060
There are two times
when no one can advise a man.

254
00:17:37,603 --> 00:17:39,939
The first is when he's drinking too much.

255
00:17:40,982 --> 00:17:43,317
The other is when he loves
the wrong woman.

256
00:17:45,361 --> 00:17:47,446
Does that bar even a father?

257
00:17:47,613 --> 00:17:49,532
Especially a father.

258
00:17:51,075 --> 00:17:53,828
You know, you make me feel
very inexperienced.

259
00:17:56,414 --> 00:17:59,792
As if you knew a lot more
about life and things than I.

260
00:18:00,626 --> 00:18:01,877
Oh, I do.

261
00:18:02,253 --> 00:18:03,504
A great deal more.

262
00:18:04,922 --> 00:18:08,050
About life and men and women.

263
00:18:09,093 --> 00:18:10,219
Particularly men.

264
00:18:10,386 --> 00:18:13,347
Hmm. You might, uh, advise me?

265
00:18:14,181 --> 00:18:15,057
Might?

266
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,769
Oh, I expect I am hopelessly
of another generation.

267
00:18:19,103 --> 00:18:20,563
Maybe I'm too old.

268
00:18:21,188 --> 00:18:23,190
You? Old?

269
00:18:23,357 --> 00:18:24,275
[laughs]

270
00:18:24,984 --> 00:18:28,613
Well, I'm still young enough
to fairly purr, at that.

271
00:18:30,114 --> 00:18:33,159
Well, well, here I am'
going on about my troubles.

272
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,828
And usually it's the other way around,
isn't it?

273
00:18:36,621 --> 00:18:41,208
I mean, uh, usually it's the young lady
who tells the story of her life.

274
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,002
I'm not sure.

275
00:18:44,378 --> 00:18:46,505
I've never had any such experience.

276
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:48,716
- Yet.
- Oh?

277
00:18:49,342 --> 00:18:52,345
You see, this is my first night at...

278
00:18:52,803 --> 00:18:54,013
at that sort of thing.

279
00:18:56,098 --> 00:18:58,559
It does sound like
the usual story, doesn't it?

280
00:18:59,310 --> 00:19:00,227
Fact, though.

281
00:19:02,313 --> 00:19:03,564
I've been broke.

282
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:07,151
And I decided it was either that or...

283
00:19:07,318 --> 00:19:08,277
or the bridge.

284
00:19:08,444 --> 00:19:09,445
Oh.

285
00:19:10,404 --> 00:19:13,115
[chuckles] I never could feel
sorry enough for myself

286
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,492
to have a go at the bridge.

287
00:19:15,326 --> 00:19:16,577
[chuckles]

288
00:19:26,212 --> 00:19:28,881
You know, that's interesting. Very.

289
00:19:30,091 --> 00:19:32,718
And just tonight,
you decided to put yourself,

290
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:36,972
uh, let us say, on the market?

291
00:19:39,558 --> 00:19:41,018
I'm afraid I have.

292
00:19:41,894 --> 00:19:42,812
Afraid?

293
00:19:45,356 --> 00:19:47,983
- Not by a long yard.
- Good.

294
00:19:50,653 --> 00:19:53,447
Because I want to make a bid for your...

295
00:19:53,906 --> 00:19:54,990
your services.

296
00:19:56,409 --> 00:20:02,248
Well, after all, I did put myself
on the, let us say, market.

297
00:20:03,082 --> 00:20:05,459
Then... then you'd be willing to, uh...

298
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:09,922
[gabbles] Oh, I say, I didn't mean that.

299
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:13,843
Really, I... I mean, it's not me, you see.

300
00:20:14,009 --> 00:20:16,429
At least, not exactly. I...

301
00:20:17,638 --> 00:20:18,472
Look here.

302
00:20:19,724 --> 00:20:22,601
What would you do for £1,000?

303
00:20:23,602 --> 00:20:25,438
-£1,000?
- Mm.

304
00:20:25,771 --> 00:20:27,273
-$5,000?
- Mm-hmm.

305
00:20:27,898 --> 00:20:28,899
Do you mean it?

306
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:32,737
What would I do? Just try me.

307
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:47,001
[clears throat]

308
00:20:51,005 --> 00:20:53,799
[nervously] Uh, interesting. Uh, very.

309
00:21:00,222 --> 00:21:01,724
This is our best number.

310
00:21:01,891 --> 00:21:05,644
Oh! Uh, awfully... I mean to say...

311
00:21:06,020 --> 00:21:08,147
That is, uh, yes, quite.

312
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,861
Thank you. The young lady
is waiting, Sir Gerald.

313
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:17,490
Oh, why, thanks so much.
I mean to say, thanks so much.

314
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:25,080
[knocking]

315
00:21:25,831 --> 00:21:28,417
- Oh! I beg your pardon! I really do!
-[women] Hey!

316
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:31,003
This way, Sir Gerald. Please.

317
00:21:35,966 --> 00:21:40,137
Oh, uh, oh, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea that...

318
00:21:40,513 --> 00:21:41,764
[June] Oh, come in, Gerry.

319
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:43,808
I didn't think they made
bashful men anymore.

320
00:21:43,974 --> 00:21:44,767
But...

321
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:47,812
And you haven't said a word about this.

322
00:21:48,270 --> 00:21:50,606
Well, it's... it's fairly breathtaking.

323
00:21:50,773 --> 00:21:53,818
Stunning. I mean to say... stunning!

324
00:21:54,443 --> 00:21:57,029
And do you think it might catch
our young man's eye?

325
00:21:58,447 --> 00:22:01,408
Look here, my dear.
Let's give this thing up.

326
00:22:01,992 --> 00:22:03,494
I've been thinking it over and...

327
00:22:03,661 --> 00:22:05,162
Mmm, sorry, old man.

328
00:22:05,329 --> 00:22:06,705
- A bargain's a bargain.
- But...

329
00:22:06,872 --> 00:22:08,040
[chuckles]

330
00:22:11,001 --> 00:22:14,547
You know, I don't want to put you
in such a position.

331
00:22:14,713 --> 00:22:16,715
Now, don't you fret about me, Gerry.

332
00:22:16,882 --> 00:22:18,592
I'm having the time of my life,

333
00:22:19,134 --> 00:22:20,719
and I want that £1,000.

334
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:23,472
Oh, look here, I'll give you £1,000,

335
00:22:23,639 --> 00:22:25,474
and we'll forget
all about our little plot.

336
00:22:25,891 --> 00:22:27,476
I've got to earn that money.

337
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:30,145
I promised to get your son
away from that woman,

338
00:22:30,312 --> 00:22:31,438
and I'm going to do it.

339
00:22:31,730 --> 00:22:33,190
I must tell you that, uh...

340
00:22:33,357 --> 00:22:35,609
Are you pleased, Sir Gerald,
with the negligee and the...

341
00:22:35,776 --> 00:22:39,989
Oh, uh, yes.
We'll take these and, uh, these.

342
00:22:40,155 --> 00:22:41,282
And these?

343
00:22:41,448 --> 00:22:43,033
And this, too, if you don't mind.

344
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,286
- No, by all means, if you will have it.
-[chuckles]

345
00:22:46,328 --> 00:22:47,788
They're rather expensive, aren't they?

346
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,665
Well, that's rather in their favor,
isn't it?

347
00:22:49,832 --> 00:22:53,878
[laughs] Shall I have these sent
to your apartment, madam?

348
00:22:54,044 --> 00:22:55,671
And, uh, madam's address?

349
00:22:56,672 --> 00:22:58,591
Oh, yes. The address.

350
00:22:58,757 --> 00:23:01,260
It is, uh, 7, Cumsterbree Street.

351
00:23:01,427 --> 00:23:03,804
And, uh, might I just see
the manager, please?

352
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:05,472
- Oh, certainly, Sir Gerald.
- Thank you.

353
00:23:09,852 --> 00:23:12,438
Fancy, madam not knowing her own address!

354
00:23:12,605 --> 00:23:13,856
[both laugh]

355
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:18,569
It's not so strange. My agent
only took the place this afternoon.

356
00:23:18,736 --> 00:23:20,821
- Is it the one we wanted?
- Oh, quite.

357
00:23:20,988 --> 00:23:22,531
But I still feel, uh...

358
00:23:28,245 --> 00:23:30,289
[lively chatter and laughter]

359
00:23:30,456 --> 00:23:33,584
Come on, boys and girls.
We're all for a jolly old pub crawl!

360
00:23:33,751 --> 00:23:35,419
Crawling in a pub above?

361
00:23:35,586 --> 00:23:37,421
[laughter and indistinct chatter]

362
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,257
Come on, Russell, my lad.

363
00:23:40,424 --> 00:23:41,967
Oh, I don't care to crawl this evening.

364
00:23:42,134 --> 00:23:43,135
Come along!

365
00:23:43,302 --> 00:23:44,762
- Let's go.
- Let's go without.

366
00:23:44,929 --> 00:23:46,263
I'll see you to the door.

367
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:48,057
Don't go to all the parties.

368
00:23:48,223 --> 00:23:51,352
[all laughing and chatting]

369
00:23:51,518 --> 00:23:53,437
Oh, oh, beg your pardon, Nikolai.

370
00:23:53,604 --> 00:23:56,690
- Mustn't be jealous, old thing.
-[both laughing]

371
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:58,651
[all laughing]

372
00:24:02,071 --> 00:24:03,948
Russell did get swacked
in a hurry, didn't he?

373
00:24:04,114 --> 00:24:06,575
You know, I can't understand
the younger generation.

374
00:24:06,742 --> 00:24:10,287
-9:00, and the blighter can't even crawl!
-[group laughing]

375
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:13,248
How are we going down, then?

376
00:24:13,415 --> 00:24:14,583
In my car.

377
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,168
- In your car?
- Look out.

378
00:24:16,335 --> 00:24:19,129
- Oh, I beg your pardon.
- We're sorry.

379
00:24:19,296 --> 00:24:20,798
Now, look here, Freddy.

380
00:24:20,965 --> 00:24:22,508
Come along. Come along.

381
00:24:22,675 --> 00:24:24,510
[chatter continues]

382
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:31,225
Will you, Berthine? Tonight in my flat?

383
00:24:31,892 --> 00:24:34,311
Darling, I'd love it, but you're tight.

384
00:24:34,728 --> 00:24:36,021
Not too tight.

385
00:24:36,689 --> 00:24:38,607
Just a little tight, maybe.

386
00:24:38,774 --> 00:24:40,442
Another drink and you'll go to sleep.

387
00:24:40,609 --> 00:24:43,445
I know you. I won't take another drink.

388
00:24:43,779 --> 00:24:45,906
Solemn oath. Will you, Berthine?

389
00:24:46,323 --> 00:24:48,951
[Berthine] How can I, darling?
I've got to go with the party.

390
00:24:49,118 --> 00:24:50,828
Oh, give them the slip.

391
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,621
Pretend you're going home, see?

392
00:24:52,788 --> 00:24:54,581
Then come back. I'll wait.

393
00:24:54,748 --> 00:24:56,500
[Berthine] But Nikolai,
he'll be suspicious.

394
00:24:56,667 --> 00:24:59,545
[Russell] Oh, Nikolai!
Who cares for Nikolai?

395
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:00,713
Will you, Berthine?

396
00:25:01,672 --> 00:25:03,340
[Berthine] I'll be back inside an hour.

397
00:25:03,590 --> 00:25:05,968
But remember, now. No more drinks.

398
00:25:06,135 --> 00:25:08,470
[Russell] Uh-uh. No more drinks.

399
00:25:14,435 --> 00:25:17,521
[man] The royal coach!
A couple of royal coaches.

400
00:25:17,855 --> 00:25:19,356
Good night, sweet prince!

401
00:25:20,399 --> 00:25:21,692
[door closes]

402
00:25:34,872 --> 00:25:36,248
Well, hello.

403
00:25:36,874 --> 00:25:38,584
Fancy meeting you here.

404
00:25:39,543 --> 00:25:41,086
Who are you, anyway?

405
00:25:41,712 --> 00:25:45,007
- Oh, how you frightened me.
-[chuckles] Sorry.

406
00:25:45,174 --> 00:25:47,176
Beg your pardon. What's the matter?

407
00:25:47,342 --> 00:25:50,054
An awfully stupid thing.
I'm afraid I've lost my key.

408
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:52,681
Oh, it's nothing. Absolutely nothing.

409
00:25:52,848 --> 00:25:55,893
Lady in distress never appealed
to a Courtney in vain.

410
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,644
I'm afraid you can't. You see--

411
00:25:57,811 --> 00:25:59,897
Oh, no such word as "can't."

412
00:26:00,064 --> 00:26:01,607
Just leave it to me.

413
00:26:01,982 --> 00:26:03,942
Good old Rock of Gib...

414
00:26:05,152 --> 00:26:06,695
Gib... Rock of...

415
00:26:07,321 --> 00:26:09,490
Anyway, good ol, Rock.

416
00:26:10,282 --> 00:26:11,200
Millie!

417
00:26:11,366 --> 00:26:12,785
[Millie] Coming, sir, in half a tick!

418
00:26:13,243 --> 00:26:14,912
A personal favor, Millie.

419
00:26:15,204 --> 00:26:17,456
Charming lady's lost her key.

420
00:26:18,082 --> 00:26:19,792
All right, all right.

421
00:26:19,958 --> 00:26:22,503
Everything will be as right as rain
in half a mo.

422
00:26:23,003 --> 00:26:24,630
-[lock rattles]
- Here we are.

423
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:27,716
There we are.

424
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,301
Thank you, Millie.

425
00:26:29,468 --> 00:26:30,636
[Russell] Thank you, Millie.

426
00:26:30,803 --> 00:26:32,638
And thank you, too, so much.

427
00:26:32,805 --> 00:26:34,056
That's all right.

428
00:26:34,807 --> 00:26:37,267
Just trust me in hour of peril.

429
00:26:37,518 --> 00:26:41,188
Regular old Rock of Gib... Rock of G...

430
00:26:41,814 --> 00:26:44,191
Anyway, I tried that once before.

431
00:26:44,358 --> 00:26:47,152
[laughs]
I'd like to ask you in, but, uh...

432
00:26:47,319 --> 00:26:48,821
Oh, oh.

433
00:26:48,987 --> 00:26:50,864
"Would you step into my parlor?"

434
00:26:51,031 --> 00:26:53,075
says the spider to the fly.

435
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:56,453
Nice little spider, though.

436
00:26:57,162 --> 00:26:58,330
Cute spider.

437
00:26:58,997 --> 00:27:01,083
Uh, sorry. Some other time.

438
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:04,753
Other engagement.
One does have other engagements.

439
00:27:04,920 --> 00:27:06,839
Engagement with a lady, too.

440
00:27:07,005 --> 00:27:08,590
But maybe I could give you a drink.

441
00:27:08,757 --> 00:27:11,468
Drink? Me?

442
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:15,305
No. Don't drink. Gave my solemn promise.

443
00:27:15,472 --> 00:27:16,348
Word of honor.

444
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:18,600
Then perhaps a cup of coffee.

445
00:27:19,017 --> 00:27:22,521
Oh, I can't sleep a wink
when I drink coffee at night.

446
00:27:25,774 --> 00:27:28,527
Say, who wants coffee, anyway?

447
00:27:29,528 --> 00:27:32,030
Oh. How about a dash of whiskey?

448
00:27:32,197 --> 00:27:33,824
Nature's own remedy.

449
00:27:34,241 --> 00:27:35,284
The very thing.

450
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:37,286
Strange I didn't think of that myself.

451
00:28:10,611 --> 00:28:13,197
This can't be a respectable place.

452
00:28:13,739 --> 00:28:14,865
[chuckles]

453
00:28:16,033 --> 00:28:17,159
No, ma'am.

454
00:28:17,993 --> 00:28:20,579
Much too cozy to be respectable.

455
00:28:30,297 --> 00:28:32,007
Clever little spider.

456
00:28:32,758 --> 00:28:35,385
Uh, but I must be toddling along, hmm.

457
00:28:36,470 --> 00:28:39,640
An engagement. Beautiful lady.

458
00:28:39,806 --> 00:28:41,892
Uh-huh. [laughs]

459
00:28:49,691 --> 00:28:51,276
Just what I needed.

460
00:28:51,443 --> 00:28:54,863
What you really need, old man,
is a tuck-in and a little bye-bye.

461
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,617
[laughs] Naughty little spider.

462
00:29:11,463 --> 00:29:12,631
Oh!

463
00:29:13,966 --> 00:29:15,384
I say.

464
00:29:16,051 --> 00:29:19,304
Really, I got to be getting along.

465
00:29:20,055 --> 00:29:23,350
Come on. Just a little rest, old man.

466
00:29:24,768 --> 00:29:28,689
Now I know it isn't respectable. [laughs]

467
00:29:29,314 --> 00:29:31,149
Beds aren't respectable.

468
00:29:31,316 --> 00:29:33,568
No, ma'am. [laughs]

469
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:39,116
Especially this bed isn't... respectable.

470
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,413
Wicked little spider. [laughs]

471
00:29:44,913 --> 00:29:47,124
Come on. Just a little rest.

472
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:49,042
Go bye-bye.

473
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:51,378
[Russell chuckles] Go bye-bye.

474
00:30:01,513 --> 00:30:02,472
Russell?

475
00:30:04,141 --> 00:30:05,183
Darling?

476
00:30:12,065 --> 00:30:12,899
[door slams]

477
00:30:44,765 --> 00:30:45,932
[groans]

478
00:30:46,266 --> 00:30:47,225
[groans]

479
00:32:16,356 --> 00:32:17,566
[snickers]

480
00:32:21,153 --> 00:32:22,904
[both laugh]

481
00:32:24,448 --> 00:32:26,283
Was I fairly awful?

482
00:32:26,450 --> 00:32:28,785
The important thing is,
how are you this morning?

483
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:31,204
Fairly awful.

484
00:32:31,705 --> 00:32:34,332
You'll feel better after some tea
and a bit of breakfast.

485
00:32:35,667 --> 00:32:38,879
Don't you think a mild brandy and soda
would be more to the point?

486
00:32:39,045 --> 00:32:40,172
Mm-mm.

487
00:32:47,262 --> 00:32:52,434
I seem to remember nothing
except vaguely a lost key

488
00:32:52,601 --> 00:32:54,853
and... something
about the Rock of Gibraltar.

489
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:57,355
Don't you remember anything else?

490
00:32:58,732 --> 00:32:59,983
You don't mean to tell me...

491
00:33:00,525 --> 00:33:02,110
Well, that is,

492
00:33:02,486 --> 00:33:05,155
maybe it's not quite courteous, but, uh...

493
00:33:05,822 --> 00:33:07,491
Oh, dear.

494
00:33:08,575 --> 00:33:11,703
Not even calling me
a cute, naughty little spider?

495
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,330
-[china clinks]
- Did I do that?

496
00:33:15,624 --> 00:33:17,792
- Baby talk.
-[laughs]

497
00:33:18,710 --> 00:33:19,794
And what else?

498
00:33:20,712 --> 00:33:21,713
What else?

499
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:24,508
Look here! I mean, did I...

500
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:26,593
That is, uh, did we...

501
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,055
Oh, you mean did you...
that is... did we...

502
00:33:30,222 --> 00:33:32,557
- Where am I, anyway?
-[laughs]

503
00:33:32,724 --> 00:33:35,018
Isn't it the girl
that's supposed to ask that?

504
00:33:35,602 --> 00:33:37,312
"Oh! Where am I?"

505
00:33:38,188 --> 00:33:39,648
You're in my flat.

506
00:33:39,898 --> 00:33:44,152
I found you wandering about in the hallway
and thought you'd be safer here with me.

507
00:33:47,614 --> 00:33:48,448
Was I?

508
00:33:49,282 --> 00:33:50,367
Was you what?

509
00:33:50,992 --> 00:33:53,119
Was I... safer?

510
00:33:53,662 --> 00:33:54,746
[chuckles]

511
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:58,500
Better get into these, hadn't you?

512
00:33:58,667 --> 00:34:02,212
But, I mean, didn't we... That is...

513
00:34:02,754 --> 00:34:05,882
Well, how did I get out of these
and into these?

514
00:34:06,049 --> 00:34:09,094
[laughs] Don't blush. It's all right.

515
00:34:09,261 --> 00:34:11,346
I once studied to be a trained nurse.

516
00:34:17,435 --> 00:34:19,604
Look here, you're an awfully good sort.

517
00:34:19,771 --> 00:34:22,399
I'm afraid I misjudged. I'm sorry.

518
00:34:23,942 --> 00:34:27,070
Good heavens. I just remembered.

519
00:34:27,237 --> 00:34:28,613
I had an engagement.

520
00:34:29,114 --> 00:34:30,156
- With a lady?
- Uh-huh.

521
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:31,741
A very important lady?

522
00:34:31,908 --> 00:34:35,370
Well, she seemed important
last night... awfully.

523
00:34:35,537 --> 00:34:37,747
And she'll want apologizing to
this morning.

524
00:34:37,914 --> 00:34:39,583
Don't overdo the apology.

525
00:34:39,749 --> 00:34:42,586
After all, you didn't do anything
but break an engagement.

526
00:34:42,752 --> 00:34:47,215
Then I... Then I didn't...
That is... We... [sighs]

527
00:34:48,091 --> 00:34:53,054
I simply can't understand why you've done
such a thing for me, a perfect stranger.

528
00:34:53,221 --> 00:34:55,348
Well, I didn't do it for you, precisely,

529
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:57,267
and you're not a perfect stranger.

530
00:34:57,434 --> 00:34:59,227
Far from perfect, I should say.

531
00:34:59,811 --> 00:35:01,438
Then we've met before somewhere?

532
00:35:01,605 --> 00:35:02,647
Mm...

533
00:35:02,814 --> 00:35:04,816
- Mutual friends?
-[chuckles]

534
00:35:05,525 --> 00:35:08,320
It's too much of a riddle
in my present feeble condition.

535
00:35:08,486 --> 00:35:11,281
You'll feel better after a tub
and a bit of breakfast.

536
00:35:11,823 --> 00:35:15,243
But look here! I'd like to, uh...
That is...

537
00:35:15,577 --> 00:35:18,079
- I'd like to talk with you.
- The tub first.

538
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:20,665
Up in your own flat,
then back here for breakfast.

539
00:35:21,458 --> 00:35:24,210
And a cozy chat. You care for that?

540
00:35:24,377 --> 00:35:26,921
Care for it? Oh, I'd say I'd love it.

541
00:35:27,088 --> 00:35:28,006
[chuckles]

542
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:05,335
What do you mean you can't put me through?

543
00:36:05,502 --> 00:36:08,046
Pull up your socks, sister,
and let's hear that tinkle!

544
00:36:08,213 --> 00:36:09,214
Ring him.

545
00:36:09,881 --> 00:36:12,300
What's that? Well, ring him again!

546
00:36:12,467 --> 00:36:16,554
[phone ringing]

547
00:36:27,482 --> 00:36:29,442
[inaudible]

548
00:36:42,831 --> 00:36:44,708
[monkeys screech]

549
00:36:48,461 --> 00:36:50,714
[music playing]

550
00:37:01,683 --> 00:37:03,768
[phone ringing]

551
00:37:07,981 --> 00:37:09,482
Oh, never mind, then!

552
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:17,949
[Nikolai] Maybe there is another woman.

553
00:37:18,324 --> 00:37:20,577
When I hook 'em, they stay hooked.

554
00:37:20,952 --> 00:37:23,997
But you haven't seen him,
so you tell me, for more than a month.

555
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:29,210
If anything drove Russell off,
it's your jealousy.

556
00:37:29,377 --> 00:37:31,421
It spoiled everything. It's business!

557
00:37:31,588 --> 00:37:34,883
Business? Of course! Monkey business.

558
00:37:39,804 --> 00:37:42,098
You are still in love with him,
my precious.

559
00:37:42,474 --> 00:37:44,684
But remember, you still have me.

560
00:37:45,143 --> 00:37:46,394
How could I forget it?

561
00:37:47,729 --> 00:37:50,899
If you do, it will be just deplorable.

562
00:37:53,818 --> 00:37:56,237
The woman who tries to make
the fool out of me...

563
00:37:58,907 --> 00:38:00,325
do you know what I would do?

564
00:38:01,785 --> 00:38:03,286
Now, darling...

565
00:38:03,995 --> 00:38:07,624
how could I love anyone but my Nicky?

566
00:38:12,337 --> 00:38:14,130
Don't tell me you've lost your key.

567
00:38:14,464 --> 00:38:15,298
[chuckles]

568
00:38:16,591 --> 00:38:18,593
I'll always bless the one you did lose.

569
00:38:19,052 --> 00:38:20,470
I hope you always will.

570
00:38:25,266 --> 00:38:28,520
Good heavens!
11:00. You've got to run along.

571
00:38:28,686 --> 00:38:30,563
Remember, you're a hardworking man.

572
00:38:30,730 --> 00:38:33,316
Don't you imagine
one can overdo this early rising?

573
00:38:33,483 --> 00:38:35,360
Run along now like a good little boy.

574
00:38:35,693 --> 00:38:38,446
See you again tomorrow?
Good night, then, June.

575
00:38:38,613 --> 00:38:40,031
These have been great days for me.

576
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:41,658
They've been great for me, too.

577
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:42,909
Really, June?

578
00:38:43,201 --> 00:38:44,410
Good night, dear boy.

579
00:39:32,041 --> 00:39:34,794
[phone ringing]

580
00:39:40,091 --> 00:39:41,551
How dare you, sir?

581
00:39:42,343 --> 00:39:43,511
At this hour!

582
00:39:44,637 --> 00:39:47,265
[chuckles] How did I know?

583
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:51,519
Now, really, Gerry, who else would think
of calling me at such a time?

584
00:39:52,061 --> 00:39:55,023
I'm afraid it is rather late,
but I do so want to see you.

585
00:39:55,940 --> 00:39:58,067
Look here, suppose I bring the car around.

586
00:39:59,193 --> 00:40:01,279
Well, I could...
I could wait down the street.

587
00:40:02,196 --> 00:40:04,365
A little air might do you good. What?

588
00:40:06,409 --> 00:40:08,494
Besides, I've got something to tell you.

589
00:40:10,622 --> 00:40:12,582
- Feeling better?
- Mmm!

590
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:15,335
I knew a drive would do you good.

591
00:40:15,877 --> 00:40:18,046
I was tired, but I'm not now.

592
00:40:21,007 --> 00:40:24,302
You know, I feel rather guilty
dragging you out like this.

593
00:40:24,886 --> 00:40:27,347
You needn't. I wanted to come.

594
00:40:28,348 --> 00:40:29,849
What did you have to tell me?

595
00:40:30,683 --> 00:40:32,810
Oh, lots of things.

596
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,022
You're too sleepy now to listen.

597
00:40:36,940 --> 00:40:39,317
No. No, I'm not. Really.

598
00:40:39,692 --> 00:40:41,152
[chuckles]

599
00:41:13,559 --> 00:41:14,686
Have a light, sir.

600
00:41:15,895 --> 00:41:16,938
Father!

601
00:41:17,313 --> 00:41:19,440
- This is a surprise.
-[laughs]

602
00:41:20,191 --> 00:41:23,111
Sit down, won't you?
Or, better still, let's have tea together.

603
00:41:23,277 --> 00:41:27,240
- No, no. Awfully sorry, my boy, but--
- But you don't have to tea seriously.

604
00:41:27,407 --> 00:41:30,994
Just because I'm not drinking is no reason
why you shouldn't have a spot of the best.

605
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:33,538
To tell you the truth, my boy,
I've an engagement.

606
00:41:33,705 --> 00:41:35,707
Oh, can't be helped, can it?

607
00:41:35,873 --> 00:41:38,543
One does have other engagements,
of course.

608
00:41:38,710 --> 00:41:39,794
No, but, really...

609
00:41:39,961 --> 00:41:41,671
Oh, some wench, I presume.

610
00:41:41,838 --> 00:41:44,215
Now, now. Now, now, my boy.

611
00:41:44,382 --> 00:41:46,592
Save the scolding for luncheon tomorrow.

612
00:41:46,759 --> 00:41:50,722
What are our fathers coming to, anyway?

613
00:41:50,888 --> 00:41:52,640
[laughs]

614
00:41:52,807 --> 00:41:56,769
Well, you see, I was just toddling by,
and I thought I'd pop in and...

615
00:41:56,936 --> 00:42:01,357
Uh... By the way,
Cartin says you're doing rather well.

616
00:42:01,524 --> 00:42:05,361
Rather well? Modest old Cartin. Look here.

617
00:42:05,528 --> 00:42:07,405
If he gives me the proper chance,

618
00:42:07,572 --> 00:42:10,491
I'll put this musty old firm on its feet.

619
00:42:10,992 --> 00:42:12,201
[laughs]

620
00:42:12,368 --> 00:42:13,327
Good boy.

621
00:42:20,251 --> 00:42:21,753
My job's about done.

622
00:42:22,545 --> 00:42:25,131
And I think I deserve a pat on the head,
really.

623
00:42:25,298 --> 00:42:26,174
[both laugh]

624
00:42:26,340 --> 00:42:29,260
It's only a month,
and the other woman's out of it'

625
00:42:29,427 --> 00:42:30,887
and the boy is hard at work.

626
00:42:31,054 --> 00:42:32,805
Oh, it's all beyond thanks.

627
00:42:33,723 --> 00:42:36,350
I've got my boy back and I owe you--

628
00:42:36,517 --> 00:42:39,937
You owe me exactly £1,000.

629
00:42:40,104 --> 00:42:42,565
You've earned it, too. Every penny.

630
00:42:44,067 --> 00:42:46,110
It wasn't really such a hard job.

631
00:42:46,778 --> 00:42:52,784
Russell's a decent boy, and, after all,
a few wild oats are indicated.

632
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:59,499
You know, the amazing thing to me is that,
uh, he hasn't fallen in love with you.

633
00:43:00,708 --> 00:43:02,168
I've been careful of that.

634
00:43:03,461 --> 00:43:05,546
Russell and I are just good pals.

635
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:08,216
As if I were a sister or another chap.

636
00:43:08,382 --> 00:43:11,677
Suppose he were in love with you.

637
00:43:13,471 --> 00:43:14,680
It couldn't be.

638
00:43:24,273 --> 00:43:26,901
You see, there's another man.

639
00:43:27,068 --> 00:43:27,944
Ano--

640
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:29,570
Oh.

641
00:43:29,737 --> 00:43:31,322
Shocked? You shouldn't be.

642
00:43:31,489 --> 00:43:33,533
You see, I... I never imagined that...

643
00:43:33,950 --> 00:43:35,409
Oh, perhaps you should be.

644
00:43:36,327 --> 00:43:37,662
Because the other man is...

645
00:43:38,204 --> 00:43:39,122
is you.

646
00:43:43,042 --> 00:43:44,877
Oh, my dear, my dear.

647
00:43:45,044 --> 00:43:47,338
I've been waiting and wanting to tell you.

648
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,298
And I've been wanting to hear it.

649
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:54,178
But not now. No, don't. It's no-go, Gerry.

650
00:43:54,762 --> 00:43:58,850
I hate to remind you, but I'm only a woman
that came to you from the streets.

651
00:43:59,016 --> 00:44:01,561
Oh, my dear, you're not really that sort.

652
00:44:01,727 --> 00:44:04,897
You see, you'd never be able to trust me.

653
00:44:05,398 --> 00:44:08,901
You'd always wonder about the past.
All men do.

654
00:44:09,068 --> 00:44:11,404
Oh, don't say things like that.

655
00:44:12,321 --> 00:44:14,323
I tell you, I wouldn't care.

656
00:44:14,782 --> 00:44:20,204
I'd trust you in spite of anything...
that happened.

657
00:44:20,371 --> 00:44:22,415
It's too good to be true.

658
00:44:23,124 --> 00:44:24,917
Much too good to be true.

659
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:27,879
Oh, have faith, my dear.
Have faith. I have.

660
00:44:29,547 --> 00:44:30,423
Perhaps.

661
00:44:31,674 --> 00:44:32,800
It might be.

662
00:44:33,718 --> 00:44:37,054
But I must go away first,
if only for a little while,

663
00:44:37,221 --> 00:44:40,057
and when I come back... if I come back--

664
00:44:40,224 --> 00:44:41,475
I won't let you go.

665
00:44:41,642 --> 00:44:45,438
Oh, but I must go and think things out,
away from you.

666
00:44:46,564 --> 00:44:49,734
In the meantime, my job's not quite done.

667
00:44:49,901 --> 00:44:51,819
We always agreed
we should tell Russell the truth.

668
00:44:51,986 --> 00:44:54,113
- Mmm.
- And now is the time.

669
00:44:54,280 --> 00:44:55,489
We must be fair with the boy.

670
00:44:55,656 --> 00:44:57,283
You know, I almost wish we...

671
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:00,328
Oh, don't you bother. I'll tell him.

672
00:45:00,494 --> 00:45:02,997
- But...
- He'll take it with a smile.

673
00:45:03,372 --> 00:45:05,541
[chuckles] You see, we're pals.

674
00:45:06,751 --> 00:45:08,336
[both chuckle]

675
00:45:13,799 --> 00:45:16,594
These quiet little teas have been
the sweetest things in my life.

676
00:45:17,345 --> 00:45:18,804
You've been a great pal, June.

677
00:45:19,222 --> 00:45:20,681
We are pals, aren't we, Russell?

678
00:45:20,848 --> 00:45:22,808
The best. And nothing but.

679
00:45:24,977 --> 00:45:26,062
Look here.

680
00:45:26,687 --> 00:45:28,731
You're not growing serious on me, are you?

681
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:32,151
Sometimes it's hard even for pals
to talk about things.

682
00:45:32,318 --> 00:45:34,237
After the lectures I've listened to?

683
00:45:34,528 --> 00:45:37,031
Ha! Fire away, old chum.

684
00:45:37,198 --> 00:45:38,741
Swing the blooming ax.

685
00:45:39,158 --> 00:45:42,203
Remember that first morning'
when you found yourself in my bed?

686
00:45:42,370 --> 00:45:44,372
Spare my blushes.

687
00:45:44,789 --> 00:45:46,999
And I told you
you weren't precisely a stranger.

688
00:45:47,166 --> 00:45:50,211
"Perfect stranger"
was the exact and somewhat vicious phrase.

689
00:45:50,711 --> 00:45:54,465
You see, I knew about you, Russell,
all about you.

690
00:45:54,924 --> 00:45:57,009
You did say you trained for nursing.

691
00:45:57,176 --> 00:45:58,469
[chuckles]

692
00:45:58,636 --> 00:46:00,554
I'm sorry. Please go on.

693
00:46:01,138 --> 00:46:03,266
I knew about you because I was hired...

694
00:46:03,683 --> 00:46:07,019
hired to find out,
to get you away from that other girl.

695
00:46:07,186 --> 00:46:08,187
You're joking.

696
00:46:09,730 --> 00:46:11,482
But, June, who would?

697
00:46:12,984 --> 00:46:13,943
Your father.

698
00:46:20,408 --> 00:46:24,912
[laughs] Good old governor.
Now, wouldn't he, though, just?

699
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:26,998
- You're not angry?
- Angry?

700
00:46:27,164 --> 00:46:29,083
Angry because
the two dearest people in the world

701
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:30,918
saved me from making a fool of myself?

702
00:46:31,252 --> 00:46:33,838
I knew you'd take it this way.
I told him you would.

703
00:46:34,005 --> 00:46:35,172
What other way is there?

704
00:46:35,673 --> 00:46:39,677
How could I be anything but grateful
when it brought me you?

705
00:46:40,136 --> 00:46:41,929
You, dear, dear June.

706
00:46:42,596 --> 00:46:44,515
And I'll play
the little joke off on Father.

707
00:46:44,682 --> 00:46:47,935
[laughs]
Rare old Father, when I tell him about us.

708
00:46:49,770 --> 00:46:51,147
You know already, don't you, June?

709
00:46:51,522 --> 00:46:52,815
No, no. Oh, Russell!

710
00:46:52,982 --> 00:46:54,817
Oh, no, you didn't know?

711
00:46:54,984 --> 00:46:57,445
- You know how I love you, how I want you.
- Don't say it! Don't!

712
00:46:57,611 --> 00:46:59,071
But I have said it.

713
00:46:59,989 --> 00:47:01,073
[Russell] Oh.

714
00:47:02,033 --> 00:47:04,618
You mean you don't care for me?

715
00:47:05,411 --> 00:47:06,495
That way, I mean.

716
00:47:10,458 --> 00:47:11,334
June.

717
00:47:16,630 --> 00:47:17,757
Is there...

718
00:47:19,675 --> 00:47:21,010
Is there someone else?

719
00:47:25,806 --> 00:47:27,099
Forget it, then, June.

720
00:47:28,726 --> 00:47:29,727
I'm sorry.

721
00:47:31,812 --> 00:47:33,147
Awfully sorry.

722
00:47:35,232 --> 00:47:36,692
Just forget what I've said.

723
00:47:37,777 --> 00:47:39,070
We're still pals.

724
00:47:42,365 --> 00:47:43,199
June.

725
00:47:44,075 --> 00:47:45,201
It's not...

726
00:47:45,826 --> 00:47:46,827
not him!

727
00:47:47,328 --> 00:47:48,537
Not my father!

728
00:48:14,021 --> 00:48:15,147
Good afternoon, sir.

729
00:48:15,314 --> 00:48:16,649
Good afternoon, Dobbs.

730
00:48:19,110 --> 00:48:20,236
[clears throat]

731
00:48:22,238 --> 00:48:23,656
Half a mo, Dobbs.

732
00:48:24,073 --> 00:48:26,659
[slurs] Never remove the rare old liquors.

733
00:48:53,227 --> 00:48:54,478
Drinking, Russell?

734
00:48:55,146 --> 00:48:57,064
Drinking? [scoffs]

735
00:48:57,565 --> 00:49:00,276
I'd scarcely call it drinking, Sir Gerald.

736
00:49:01,318 --> 00:49:04,196
Let us say, uh, a preparation.

737
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:08,117
Laying a foundation
for some real drinking.

738
00:49:10,244 --> 00:49:13,247
Surely you don't grudge me
a mild spot of whiskey.

739
00:49:14,123 --> 00:49:17,126
You share everything else
with your only son.

740
00:49:18,669 --> 00:49:22,298
Gentlemen, I give you Sir Gerald Courtney.

741
00:49:22,465 --> 00:49:24,842
My father. [scoffs]

742
00:49:25,009 --> 00:49:29,430
And when I say "I give him,"
gentlemen, I mean I give him.

743
00:49:29,597 --> 00:49:30,806
You can have him.

744
00:49:30,973 --> 00:49:32,975
I don't want him.

745
00:49:33,142 --> 00:49:35,019
What's got into you, my boy?

746
00:49:35,478 --> 00:49:36,729
Unusual, huh?

747
00:49:36,937 --> 00:49:38,814
Prodigal son disowning proud father?

748
00:49:38,981 --> 00:49:40,191
Oh, you're talking nonsense!

749
00:49:40,357 --> 00:49:42,776
Oh, quit it! Quit your lies!

750
00:49:43,277 --> 00:49:45,613
You've been bleating
that you and I couldn't talk things out.

751
00:49:46,071 --> 00:49:49,116
Well, we're going to talk now,
only I'm going to do the talking!

752
00:49:49,492 --> 00:49:52,495
She's told me, told me
of your sneaky, underhand tricks!

753
00:49:52,661 --> 00:49:54,747
- Steady on, my boy.
- She's told me!

754
00:49:54,914 --> 00:49:56,916
Told me how you sent her to me,
to make me love her'

755
00:49:57,082 --> 00:49:59,293
to make me want her
more than I've ever wanted anything!

756
00:50:00,211 --> 00:50:01,170
You?

757
00:50:02,379 --> 00:50:03,255
Love her?

758
00:50:03,422 --> 00:50:04,215
Oh.

759
00:50:05,216 --> 00:50:07,718
I'm sorry. I didn't know.

760
00:50:07,885 --> 00:50:10,012
Yes, you're sorry. You didn't know!

761
00:50:10,179 --> 00:50:12,556
- Russell, I only meant...
- Oh, don't whine!

762
00:50:12,723 --> 00:50:14,433
Talk up like a man. Don't mealy-mouth me!

763
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:15,893
Please, please, please believe me!

764
00:50:16,060 --> 00:50:18,521
Believe you? Why should I believe you?

765
00:50:18,687 --> 00:50:19,772
You're a liar!

766
00:50:21,565 --> 00:50:23,108
Listen to me! You've got to listen to me.

767
00:50:23,275 --> 00:50:27,196
You listen, I'm sick of lies
and sick of liars, sick of everything.

768
00:50:27,571 --> 00:50:29,073
Reform me, eh?

769
00:50:29,573 --> 00:50:31,408
You reform me?

770
00:50:31,825 --> 00:50:33,744
You and that one, you hypocrite!

771
00:50:33,911 --> 00:50:36,497
Sending her to me.
My own father sending his--

772
00:50:36,664 --> 00:50:38,666
- You don't say that!
- Ugly word, isn't it?

773
00:50:38,832 --> 00:50:41,335
But it fits her, the woman you picked up
from the streets!

774
00:50:41,502 --> 00:50:42,836
- Nothing but a common--
- Stop!

775
00:50:43,295 --> 00:50:45,839
Go ahead. Hit me.
You've done everything else to me.

776
00:50:46,006 --> 00:50:48,050
If you were anyone else
but my own son, I'd...

777
00:50:48,217 --> 00:50:50,052
Well, I haven't the same compunction.

778
00:50:50,219 --> 00:50:51,387
My father...

779
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:57,935
Russell.

780
00:51:06,819 --> 00:51:07,945
Oh, Russell!

781
00:51:27,798 --> 00:51:28,841
What's happened?

782
00:51:30,384 --> 00:51:31,552
Tell me, Gerry.

783
00:51:32,386 --> 00:51:35,347
He's been here, and he's gone.

784
00:51:36,724 --> 00:51:37,683
Forever.

785
00:51:38,767 --> 00:51:39,893
Oh, no!

786
00:51:40,644 --> 00:51:41,604
No!

787
00:51:42,146 --> 00:51:43,981
I'll bring him back to you. I'll...

788
00:51:44,356 --> 00:51:46,900
He wanted to strike me.

789
00:51:47,901 --> 00:51:49,570
My own son.

790
00:51:49,737 --> 00:51:50,738
[gasps]

791
00:51:51,488 --> 00:51:52,990
Oh, no, no! He didn't!

792
00:51:54,617 --> 00:51:55,618
He didn't mean to.

793
00:51:56,577 --> 00:51:57,745
He's only a boy.

794
00:51:58,329 --> 00:52:00,581
And he was hurt, like a boy.

795
00:52:02,291 --> 00:52:03,959
He wanted to hurt someone else.

796
00:52:05,711 --> 00:52:07,212
Try to understand.

797
00:52:07,963 --> 00:52:10,549
You wouldn't mind
if a child in a nursery struck you.

798
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:12,509
That's what it was.

799
00:52:13,969 --> 00:52:16,847
I've lost... my son.

800
00:52:21,894 --> 00:52:22,895
No, no!

801
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:24,772
It can't be!

802
00:52:26,774 --> 00:52:28,192
I won't let it happen.

803
00:52:28,776 --> 00:52:30,653
It has happened.

804
00:52:35,074 --> 00:52:36,200
And I'm to blame.

805
00:52:38,661 --> 00:52:40,079
It's all my fault.

806
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:43,582
Oh, I might have known
it would be like this.

807
00:52:45,000 --> 00:52:48,754
I think I did know in my heart,
but I wouldn't listen.

808
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:52,800
You see...

809
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:55,386
I love you, Gerry.

810
00:52:56,178 --> 00:52:57,596
And I wanted to help you.

811
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,517
Great help I've been.

812
00:53:06,814 --> 00:53:09,233
I... I do love you.

813
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:12,319
I'll always love you.

814
00:53:13,612 --> 00:53:15,531
And I love you too much to hurt you.

815
00:53:17,282 --> 00:53:18,492
You?

816
00:53:19,034 --> 00:53:19,910
Hurt me?

817
00:53:21,078 --> 00:53:22,454
Do you think I could go on

818
00:53:23,247 --> 00:53:26,458
and have you remember
that because of me, you lost him?

819
00:53:47,938 --> 00:53:50,190
It's the boy, isn't it, Gerry?

820
00:53:51,567 --> 00:53:52,693
You want him.

821
00:54:00,701 --> 00:54:01,952
It's not too late.

822
00:54:03,287 --> 00:54:06,081
I'll find him and send him back to you.

823
00:54:08,542 --> 00:54:10,502
That's what you hired me for, wasn't it?

824
00:54:11,420 --> 00:54:14,339
To save your boy, for £1,000.

825
00:54:15,924 --> 00:54:17,968
You just watch me earn that money.

826
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:24,558
Hello.

827
00:54:24,933 --> 00:54:25,768
Who?

828
00:54:27,478 --> 00:54:28,562
Russell!

829
00:54:29,313 --> 00:54:31,064
Why, darling!

830
00:54:32,399 --> 00:54:33,984
Am I surprised?

831
00:54:34,151 --> 00:54:35,235
Well, rather!

832
00:54:35,652 --> 00:54:37,196
You sound familiar, though.

833
00:54:37,613 --> 00:54:39,448
Just a bit tight, aren't you?

834
00:54:40,073 --> 00:54:42,409
I thought you'd given up whiskey and me.

835
00:54:43,368 --> 00:54:47,414
What's that? A party?
I'm just ripe for a binge.

836
00:54:47,831 --> 00:54:48,707
Where?

837
00:54:49,625 --> 00:54:50,542
Your flat?

838
00:54:51,543 --> 00:54:52,961
Don't know about that.

839
00:54:53,378 --> 00:54:56,006
The last time you asked me
to meet you there, you didn't show up.

840
00:54:56,799 --> 00:55:00,093
All right, darling. Your flat, 11:00.

841
00:55:00,469 --> 00:55:01,386
Bye.

842
00:55:02,012 --> 00:55:03,806
Yes, I will. Bye.

843
00:55:33,460 --> 00:55:35,420
[car approaches]

844
00:56:29,600 --> 00:56:30,517
Russell?

845
00:56:31,268 --> 00:56:32,394
Russell, darling?

846
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:34,897
Surely you're not napping.

847
00:56:35,063 --> 00:56:36,189
Here's Berthine.

848
00:56:42,362 --> 00:56:43,614
-[gasps]
-[Nikolai] Shut your mouth!

849
00:56:44,197 --> 00:56:45,115
Where is he?

850
00:56:48,660 --> 00:56:49,870
Please don't, Nikolai!

851
00:56:50,037 --> 00:56:52,080
Come, my angel. Don't be so excited.

852
00:56:52,247 --> 00:56:56,460
- Oh, don't! Don't!
- Be calm and sweet and try to entertain me

853
00:56:56,627 --> 00:56:58,754
with some of your delightful lies.

854
00:56:58,921 --> 00:57:00,172
Don't, Nikolai. Don't.

855
00:57:00,339 --> 00:57:03,717
We shall sit here together, you and I...

856
00:57:04,217 --> 00:57:06,178
and wait for him.

857
00:57:17,606 --> 00:57:18,649
Oh, Russell!

858
00:57:19,024 --> 00:57:21,860
Get away! Take your dirty hands off!

859
00:57:22,027 --> 00:57:23,779
- All right, Russell.
- It's not all right!

860
00:57:24,237 --> 00:57:25,072
I won't touch you.

861
00:57:25,238 --> 00:57:27,115
Still trying to earn your dirty wages,
huh?

862
00:57:27,282 --> 00:57:31,119
No, you don't. You won't trick me into
your place again, you lying, sneaking--

863
00:57:31,286 --> 00:57:32,454
I won't listen to such insults!

864
00:57:32,621 --> 00:57:36,500
You won't, huh? You'll listen to me,
all right, you filthy gutter whelp.

865
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:38,460
I won't! You hear? Go away!

866
00:57:38,961 --> 00:57:41,630
Bar me out, will you? I'll show you!

867
00:57:41,797 --> 00:57:44,424
Don't try to put on airs with me,
you little tramp.

868
00:57:44,591 --> 00:57:46,677
Pretending you're particular
who comes in here,

869
00:57:46,843 --> 00:57:48,929
'cause you'll hear
the kind of talk you deserve'

870
00:57:49,096 --> 00:57:50,931
you smirking, rotten cheat!

871
00:57:51,390 --> 00:57:52,557
Oh!

872
00:57:52,724 --> 00:57:54,351
Oh, laughing at me, ain't you?

873
00:57:54,518 --> 00:57:55,894
You both laughed at me,

874
00:57:56,061 --> 00:57:57,938
you and that sweet,
sainted father of mine.

875
00:57:58,105 --> 00:57:59,022
Go ahead and laugh!

876
00:57:59,189 --> 00:58:00,273
I'm not laughing, Russell.

877
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:01,942
- We never laughed.
- You're a liar.

878
00:58:02,109 --> 00:58:04,236
Why shouldn't you laugh?
Me thinking all the time

879
00:58:04,403 --> 00:58:06,697
you were everything sweet
and clean and decent.

880
00:58:06,863 --> 00:58:08,949
[scoffs] Afraid almost to touch ya!

881
00:58:09,116 --> 00:58:11,118
Go ahead. Laugh. It's a joke!

882
00:58:11,284 --> 00:58:14,287
Me thinking poetic thoughts about you.
About you!

883
00:58:14,454 --> 00:58:16,790
A woman for hire,
a woman with a price mark on her,

884
00:58:16,957 --> 00:58:18,458
and not much of a price at that!

885
00:58:18,625 --> 00:58:21,003
A mangy, she-alley cat! Anybody's cat!

886
00:58:21,169 --> 00:58:22,379
Anybody's woman!

887
00:58:22,546 --> 00:58:24,214
You're right, Russell. That's all I am.

888
00:58:24,381 --> 00:58:26,675
- You're even worse.
- Oh, right again!

889
00:58:26,842 --> 00:58:28,927
But I've learned my lesson.
I'm going away.

890
00:58:29,094 --> 00:58:30,846
- With him, naturally.
- Alone!

891
00:58:31,013 --> 00:58:32,848
It's not that way
between your father and me.

892
00:58:33,015 --> 00:58:35,559
Don't you see? I care too much for you
to stand between you.

893
00:58:35,726 --> 00:58:37,811
You're going with him!
That's where you're going!

894
00:58:37,978 --> 00:58:40,313
Well, I'll show you!
And I'll show him, too!

895
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:41,356
Oh!

896
00:58:49,656 --> 00:58:52,200
So, you think I'm going to your old gent,
eh?

897
00:58:52,367 --> 00:58:55,537
What a priceless pair of fatheads
you and your papa are.

898
00:58:56,413 --> 00:58:59,708
Me? In love
with Sir Gerald blinkin, Courtney?

899
00:58:59,875 --> 00:59:01,793
Him,
pretending he was better than the rest.

900
00:59:02,044 --> 00:59:04,087
The only difference was
that he tried to get with pounds

901
00:59:04,254 --> 00:59:05,922
what others try to get with shillings.

902
00:59:06,089 --> 00:59:06,840
Hmm.

903
00:59:07,007 --> 00:59:09,509
Little Juney's the one that got this time.

904
00:59:09,676 --> 00:59:12,179
I got this flat and clothes and money,

905
00:59:12,554 --> 00:59:15,265
all for a sweet smile
and a "thank you, sir."

906
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:18,852
- Nothing but a--
- Nothing but!

907
00:59:19,352 --> 00:59:21,772
What did you expect?
Lilies of the blooming valley?

908
00:59:21,938 --> 00:59:24,649
I did your old man in the eye,
and he never even blinked!

909
00:59:25,150 --> 00:59:27,486
The dotty old boy didn't even get
so much as a kiss.

910
00:59:27,652 --> 00:59:30,572
You're lying!
You're his, and he can have you.

911
00:59:30,739 --> 00:59:32,949
I'll thank you to be slinging your hook.

912
00:59:34,701 --> 00:59:36,369
Think I'm drunk, don't you?

913
00:59:38,663 --> 00:59:42,250
Maybe I am. But not drunk enough
to let you trick me again.

914
00:59:42,584 --> 00:59:44,294
And not as drunk as I'm gonna get.

915
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:47,380
Do you know what I'm gonna do tonight?

916
00:59:47,672 --> 00:59:51,009
Of course I do! Like father, like son.

917
00:59:51,176 --> 00:59:55,097
You're gonna meet that prize package,
Berthine Waller, up in your flat.

918
00:59:55,263 --> 00:59:56,890
You don't like that, do you?

919
00:59:57,057 --> 00:59:59,434
Why not? Us girls got to live.

920
01:00:02,020 --> 01:00:03,063
Give me a drink.

921
01:00:04,356 --> 01:00:07,734
Give you a drink? Milk's more your style.

922
01:00:07,901 --> 01:00:10,403
- Why, you're not man enough.
- Oh, I ain't?

923
01:00:11,196 --> 01:00:12,864
Still reforming me, aren't you?

924
01:00:13,031 --> 01:00:14,324
- Give me that drink!
- No, I won't!

925
01:00:14,491 --> 01:00:15,367
Do you hear?

926
01:00:17,619 --> 01:00:18,995
Stop it! Who do you think you...

927
01:00:24,251 --> 01:00:25,377
Oh...

928
01:00:25,877 --> 01:00:26,920
Leave me alone.

929
01:00:28,046 --> 01:00:30,090
Don't try your dirty tricks on me.

930
01:00:31,049 --> 01:00:31,925
[groans]

931
01:00:34,261 --> 01:00:35,345
Leave me alone.

932

[groans]

933
01:00:40,225 --> 01:00:41,393
Leave me alone.

941
01:02:25,288 --> 01:02:27,207
I said it's a ripping morning, sir.

942
01:02:27,540 --> 01:02:29,459
Oh, yes. Ripping.

943
01:03:07,664 --> 01:03:09,082
[Millie screams]

944
01:03:09,582 --> 01:03:11,835
Murder! Murder!

945
01:03:12,168 --> 01:03:13,378
He's murdered her!

946
01:03:13,878 --> 01:03:14,963
[sobs]

947
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:19,342
Plain enough.
Happened sometime during the night.

948
01:03:19,676 --> 01:03:21,261
She came to his flat and he done her in.

949
01:03:21,428 --> 01:03:22,929
All we got to do is find the lad.

950
01:03:23,096 --> 01:03:24,681
That won't be hard.
We'll have him by night.

951
01:03:25,223 --> 01:03:27,434
You say you saw him
coming out of his flat?

952
01:03:27,600 --> 01:03:30,145
Yes, sir. He was coming down the steps.

953
01:03:30,312 --> 01:03:31,813
And he looked like he'd been drinking?

954
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,400
He looked worse than that.
He was in a daze, like.

955
01:03:35,567 --> 01:03:38,403
That's him, right enough. Tell
headquarters to arrest Russell Courtney.

956
01:03:38,945 --> 01:03:41,072
Serious, arresting the son
of Sir Gerald Courtney.

957
01:03:41,239 --> 01:03:43,450
That's serious, too,
doing a young lady in.

958
01:03:43,783 --> 01:03:44,993
It's a clear case.

959
01:03:49,164 --> 01:03:51,416
[newsie] Paper!

960
01:03:51,583 --> 01:03:54,544
Horrible happening in high life!

961
01:03:54,711 --> 01:03:57,297
Evening paper!

962
01:03:58,798 --> 01:03:59,966
[Sir James] Very well, Burton.

963
01:04:00,342 --> 01:04:03,136
Tell the officers we'll surrender
their prisoner in five minutes.

964
01:04:06,181 --> 01:04:08,141
Now, you better tell us, Russell, my boy.

965
01:04:09,017 --> 01:04:11,478
We can hardly expect further lenience
from the police.

966
01:04:11,895 --> 01:04:13,855
They've been more than fair
in bringing you here.

967
01:04:14,731 --> 01:04:19,152
Now, won't you tell us, your father
and your lawyer, where you were?

968
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:23,698
And telling where I was
is the only way to clear myself?

969
01:04:24,282 --> 01:04:25,992
No matter who else it hurts?

970
01:04:26,159 --> 01:04:27,869
It's your only chance.

971
01:04:29,871 --> 01:04:33,041
If I told the truth, the real truth,

972
01:04:34,334 --> 01:04:36,294
it would be too hard to believe.

973
01:04:37,879 --> 01:04:40,090
Tell me, my boy, can't you?

974
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:42,050
I'll understand.

975
01:04:45,804 --> 01:04:51,393
I'm afraid, Father, you'd be the last
to understand the entire truth.

976
01:04:52,977 --> 01:04:54,979
Oh, I don't mean to be unkind.

977
01:04:56,606 --> 01:04:59,025
Oh, my boy. Tell me.

978
01:04:59,651 --> 01:05:00,985
It's our last...

979
01:05:02,278 --> 01:05:03,196
chance.

980
01:05:10,954 --> 01:05:13,081
I've treated you shabbily enough already,

981
01:05:14,332 --> 01:05:15,458
haven't I, Father?

982
01:05:20,296 --> 01:05:21,381
Sorry.

983
01:05:36,229 --> 01:05:39,691
Begging pardon, Sir James, but there's
a young lady asking to see you,

984
01:05:39,858 --> 01:05:41,943
-says it's very important.
- A young lady?

985
01:05:42,110 --> 01:05:44,154
- Well, sir, that is...
- At this hour?

986
01:05:44,320 --> 01:05:45,697
- Uh--
- Tell her to return in the morning.

987
01:05:45,864 --> 01:05:48,199
- But, uh...
- Oh, nonsense, I say. Dismiss her!

988
01:05:50,827 --> 01:05:52,162
Good evening, gentlemen.

989
01:05:56,541 --> 01:05:58,543
Oh, my dear, it's good of you to come.

990
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,795
- I've been looking for you--
- Wait, Gerry.

991
01:06:01,588 --> 01:06:03,756
Wait until you've heard
what I have to say.

992
01:06:10,346 --> 01:06:11,806
You haven't told them, have you?

993
01:06:13,475 --> 01:06:15,018
I was certain you wouldn't.

994
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:17,270
Trying to save my reputation?

995
01:06:17,645 --> 01:06:19,898
It's past saving, my dear boy.

996
01:06:20,273 --> 01:06:22,484
Do you know where Russell was last night?

997
01:06:23,109 --> 01:06:25,904
Rather.
He was in a lady's apartment all night.

998
01:06:26,070 --> 01:06:29,115
- How do you know?
- I happen to be the lady.

999
01:06:29,741 --> 01:06:32,035
You mean... It can't be true.

1000
01:06:32,202 --> 01:06:33,953
- Not you and--
- Let me tell him!

1001
01:06:36,915 --> 01:06:38,875
But of course it's true.

1002
01:06:39,501 --> 01:06:42,962
It was to be expected, wasn't it?

1003
01:06:50,553 --> 01:06:51,721
Sorry.

1004
01:06:52,347 --> 01:06:54,224
I was afraid you'd take it this way.

1005
01:06:59,187 --> 01:07:00,355
But I'm not sorry.

1006
01:07:00,897 --> 01:07:01,981
I'm glad.

1007
01:07:02,649 --> 01:07:04,150
Glad to know the truth.

1008
01:07:05,527 --> 01:07:07,695
The wedding's off, eh, Sir Gerald?

1009
01:07:08,404 --> 01:07:10,657
Can't quite stick it now, can you?

1010
01:07:11,824 --> 01:07:13,910
Remember when I told you
you'd never be able to trust me?

1011
01:07:14,077 --> 01:07:16,871
Oh, you said yourself
that you and he were together.

1012
01:07:17,038 --> 01:07:19,707
What of it? Where's the faith
you swore you'd have

1013
01:07:19,874 --> 01:07:21,626
in spite of anything that's happened?

1014
01:07:22,293 --> 01:07:24,420
Well, something's happened, hasn't it?

1015
01:07:24,587 --> 01:07:26,714
And worse than anything else,
it's happened with me!

1016
01:07:27,340 --> 01:07:28,925
Me being what I am.

1017
01:07:29,425 --> 01:07:31,636
It was to be expected, wasn't it?

1018
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:33,805
I loved you.

1019
01:07:34,264 --> 01:07:35,223
Don't you see?

1020
01:07:37,225 --> 01:07:38,851
That's what makes it so...

1021
01:07:39,018 --> 01:07:40,812
"Inconvenient" is the word.

1022
01:07:41,563 --> 01:07:43,314
Jealous of your own son.

1023
01:07:43,481 --> 01:07:46,526
- Let me tell him!
- Oh, I've heard enough.

1024
01:07:46,818 --> 01:07:49,571
You'll hear just a bit more, Sir Gerald,
and you'll listen.

1025
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:53,324
Oh, yes, you will.
Russell knew how you'd take it.

1026
01:07:53,491 --> 01:07:55,493
That's why he wouldn't tell where he was.

1027
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:58,663
This righteous code that gentlemen have.

1028
01:07:59,664 --> 01:08:01,082
Marry you?

1029
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,668
Don't fret, Sir Gerald.

1030
01:08:03,835 --> 01:08:05,128
I'm not having any.

1031
01:08:05,795 --> 01:08:07,839
I'm just a woman
that came to you from the street,

1032
01:08:08,006 --> 01:08:10,258
out of the fog, a woman for hire,

1033
01:08:10,758 --> 01:08:13,303
someone you could buy and did buy,

1034
01:08:13,553 --> 01:08:16,180
but not someone, so help me,
you can marry!

1035
01:08:16,472 --> 01:08:18,641
You've done this for me?

1036
01:08:18,808 --> 01:08:21,811
I've done it for me and a thousand pounds.

1037
01:08:22,645 --> 01:08:24,939
You haven't forgotten
the thousand quid, have you?

1038
01:08:27,400 --> 01:08:29,485
You hired me to save your boy.

1039
01:08:29,652 --> 01:08:32,739
Me, a stray she-alley cat,
and, blimey, I saved him.

1040
01:08:34,282 --> 01:08:36,034
I'll take the check, if you please.

1041
01:08:48,046 --> 01:08:49,005
[chatter]

1042
01:08:49,172 --> 01:08:50,548
[man] What was his name?

1043
01:08:50,715 --> 01:08:52,467
-[man 2] Nikolai--
-[overlapping chatter]

1044
01:08:54,552 --> 01:08:58,056
Begging pardon, Sir James, but it wasn't
Mr. Courtney who did it at all.

1045
01:08:58,348 --> 01:09:01,184
- They nipped a chap, a sort of foreigner.
- Steady does it, Burton.

1046
01:09:01,351 --> 01:09:02,477
[Burton] Scotland Yard just reports

1047
01:09:02,644 --> 01:09:04,604
that they've caught
a man named Nikolai Rabinoff.

1048
01:09:04,979 --> 01:09:06,648
Caught him in Miss Waller's flat!

1049
01:09:06,981 --> 01:09:08,232
And he's confessed, sir.

1050
01:09:08,399 --> 01:09:10,568
Confessed that he killed Miss Waller.

1051
01:09:11,778 --> 01:09:14,656
[Sir James] Tell the Scotland Yard men
I'll see them in a few moments.

1052
01:09:16,866 --> 01:09:18,826
Well, you're twice lucky, young man.

1053
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:21,204
This, of course, clears you absolutely.

1054
01:09:24,957 --> 01:09:28,044
Too bad, my dear,
this couldn't have come a bit sooner.

1055
01:09:28,795 --> 01:09:31,881
It would have saved this ugly explanation.

1056
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:34,300
The gentlemen's code again.

1057
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:37,261
Covering up the unpleasant things.

1058
01:09:37,929 --> 01:09:39,430
I'd have told him anyway.

1059
01:09:39,597 --> 01:09:41,099
I'm convinced you would.

1060
01:09:45,478 --> 01:09:46,854
Thanks so much.

1061
01:09:56,197 --> 01:09:57,323
I'm sorry.

1062
01:09:58,032 --> 01:09:59,742
Really sorry.

1063
01:10:00,827 --> 01:10:01,994
I believe you are.

1064
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:04,997
But still sorry for the wrong person.

1065
01:10:06,457 --> 01:10:07,709
Goodbye, Sir Gerald.

1066
01:10:09,752 --> 01:10:11,421
Goodbye, Gerry, old man.

1067
01:10:24,976 --> 01:10:27,520
There's just one other thing, Sir Gerald.

1068
01:10:28,521 --> 01:10:32,400
Russell was in my apartment last night...
all night.

1069
01:10:33,317 --> 01:10:34,819
But I wasn't with him.

1070
01:10:35,862 --> 01:10:37,280
As you were, Sir Gerald.

1071
01:10:38,114 --> 01:10:41,868
That doesn't change things
in the least with you and me.

1072
01:10:44,078 --> 01:10:45,121
As for this?

1073
01:10:46,038 --> 01:10:49,208
You know, I have a sort of code, too.

1074
01:10:50,668 --> 01:10:53,045
I'll probably be sorry
for this in the morning.

1075
01:10:54,422 --> 01:10:57,467
However, right now...

1076
01:11:03,055 --> 01:11:05,266
June! June!

1077
01:11:05,433 --> 01:11:07,727
Don't you think
you've caused her trouble enough?

1078
01:11:12,774 --> 01:11:13,816
Father!

1079
01:11:14,734 --> 01:11:15,943
She loves you.

1080
01:11:16,110 --> 01:11:17,153
Go after her.

1081
01:11:20,531 --> 01:11:23,659
Wherever she goes, my boy, I'll follow.

1082
01:11:28,664 --> 01:11:31,667
