2
00:01:54,906 --> 00:01:56,816
Driver.

3
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,659
- Driver, stop!
- What troubles you in there?

4
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:01,578
Why do you want to stop?

5
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:04,789
The man up there,
he is bleeding to death.

6
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:07,500
Can't stop. Not here.

7
00:02:07,501 --> 00:02:09,993
Brakes won't hold.

8
00:02:56,043 --> 00:02:57,544
Orderly.

9
00:02:57,545 --> 00:02:59,536
Orderly!

10
00:03:08,387 --> 00:03:11,514
And just as guilty as
a soldier would be,

11
00:03:11,515 --> 00:03:14,058
who deserted his post under fire.

12
00:03:14,059 --> 00:03:17,427
Now, in making an
example of you, I...

13
00:03:22,232 --> 00:03:25,359
I beg your pardon, sir. I have some
wounded outside. I am looking for the...

14
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,320
Oh, yes, yes, yes.
You want the Italian unit.

15
00:03:28,321 --> 00:03:29,905
We're the English here, you see.

16
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:31,614
Yes, Number 207.

17
00:03:31,615 --> 00:03:33,366
They're in the other wing.
Moved in today.

18
00:03:33,367 --> 00:03:36,536
Yes, out that way, straight ahead.

19
00:03:36,537 --> 00:03:39,113
- Thank you, Major.
- Hmm.

20
00:03:43,876 --> 00:03:45,451
Shh!

21
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:55,710
Tut-tut!

22
00:04:11,192 --> 00:04:14,310
What's the girlfriend been doing?

23
00:04:17,114 --> 00:04:19,273
Typical male conceit!

24
00:04:28,124 --> 00:04:29,624
I think they're going
to send her back home.

25
00:04:29,625 --> 00:04:30,750
That's a dirty shame.

26
00:04:30,751 --> 00:04:32,877
- She'll be disgraced.
- It's regulations.

27
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:34,503
At least they might let
her have her baby here.

28
00:04:34,504 --> 00:04:37,339
If they send her back now,
all her friends will know.

29
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:40,133
- And her family.
- She's only herself to blame.

30
00:04:40,134 --> 00:04:42,751
This is war, Fergy,
and she loved him.

31
00:04:45,972 --> 00:04:48,256
Shh, here they come.

32
00:04:52,811 --> 00:04:56,605
Well, is it necessary for us
all to be here at one time?

33
00:04:56,606 --> 00:04:58,982
Get back to your posts.

34
00:04:58,983 --> 00:05:03,144
You will be packed and ready
to leave within the hour.

35
00:05:04,906 --> 00:05:06,814
Molly?

36
00:05:09,951 --> 00:05:12,119
Can I help you pack?

37
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,121
I guess so. If you want to.

38
00:05:15,122 --> 00:05:17,782
Why, of course I want to.

39
00:05:18,333 --> 00:05:20,919
- Good girl.
- I beg your pardon?

40
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:25,247
I say, she's the only human
being in the whole lot of us.

41
00:05:26,507 --> 00:05:29,926
I'm sorry Miss Barkley appears
to sympathise with one

42
00:05:29,927 --> 00:05:33,420
who has disgraced the
uniform we all wear.

43
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:52,404
- Baby!
- Rinaldi!

44
00:05:52,405 --> 00:05:55,865
- Frederico!
- Get away. You're filthy.

45
00:05:55,866 --> 00:05:58,910
You Anglo-Saxons!
You're not too clean yourself.

46
00:05:58,911 --> 00:06:00,953
Did you bring me some
good cases, baby?

47
00:06:00,954 --> 00:06:02,037
Did you have trouble finding us?

48
00:06:02,038 --> 00:06:03,205
- No.
- How do you feel?

49
00:06:03,206 --> 00:06:04,707
- Is there going to be an offensive?
- There's not...

50
00:06:04,708 --> 00:06:07,542
Were you under fire? Madonna,
but I worried about you!

51
00:06:07,543 --> 00:06:09,711
Yes, I can see how much
you've been worrying.

52
00:06:09,712 --> 00:06:14,298
Seven operations today, baby.
And one of them was beautiful.

53
00:06:14,299 --> 00:06:16,792
I took the heart out.

54
00:06:16,884 --> 00:06:20,095
It lay in my hand and
it beat like this.

55
00:06:20,096 --> 00:06:23,589
You should have seen it.
It was lovely!

56
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,726
Soon, Rinaldi will be the best
surgeon in all the corps.

57
00:06:26,727 --> 00:06:30,479
Then, in all the army.
And some day, in all of Italy.

58
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,731
- Why not in all the world?
- Why not?

59
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,735
You will like it here, baby.

60
00:06:36,736 --> 00:06:38,694
What sort of a town
is this? Any girls?

61
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:40,904
Many beautiful English nurses.

62
00:06:40,905 --> 00:06:44,074
- No, I mean, girls.
- Girls, too, a house full of them.

63
00:06:44,075 --> 00:06:45,325
Another Villa Rossa?

64
00:06:45,326 --> 00:06:48,035
Some of them have never
been to the front before.

65
00:06:48,036 --> 00:06:49,245
Perhaps.

66
00:06:49,246 --> 00:06:53,040
But the nurses are much nicer.
The most beautiful is Miss Barkley.

67
00:06:53,041 --> 00:06:55,451
I am in love with her.

68
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,878
- Does she know it?
- Not yet.

69
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:59,630
- Have you any money?
- Yes.

70
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,007
- Lend me 50 lire.
- What for?

71
00:07:02,008 --> 00:07:04,550
I want to make on Miss Barkley
the impression of a man

72
00:07:04,551 --> 00:07:06,135
of sufficient wealth.

73
00:07:06,136 --> 00:07:07,344
- All right.
- Thank you.

74
00:07:07,345 --> 00:07:10,264
You are my great and good
friend and financial protector.

75
00:07:10,265 --> 00:07:11,848
And you're an ass.

76
00:07:11,849 --> 00:07:13,433
And now we will eat and drink,

77
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:15,434
and I will take you
to meet Miss Barkley.

78
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,687
But you must make for me
a good impression upon her.

79
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,022
Now, listen...

80
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,275
But you must. And you
can have a nurse, too.

81
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:24,943
There is another one
named Miss Ferguson.

82
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,819
She is also very, very nice.

83
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,938
- No.
- "No"?

84
00:07:30,282 --> 00:07:32,616
First, we will eat and drink,

85
00:07:32,617 --> 00:07:36,328
and then we'll go and see the girls who
have never been to the front before.

86
00:07:36,329 --> 00:07:38,238
Yes?

87
00:07:38,998 --> 00:07:40,823
Yes.

88
00:07:51,133 --> 00:07:53,677
You know what an American is?

89
00:07:53,678 --> 00:07:55,828
- Yes.
- What is it?

90
00:07:58,056 --> 00:08:00,040
She doesn't know.

91
00:08:00,642 --> 00:08:04,727
- Well, I'm an American.
- Then what are you doing here?

92
00:08:04,728 --> 00:08:08,856
- Drinking, mostly.
- He liked the uniform.

93
00:08:08,857 --> 00:08:10,566
Wrong.

94
00:08:10,567 --> 00:08:12,651
I liked their language.

95
00:08:13,153 --> 00:08:15,946
Then what were you doing in Italy?

96
00:08:15,947 --> 00:08:17,656
Studying.

97
00:08:17,657 --> 00:08:19,857
Studying what?

98
00:08:20,409 --> 00:08:22,610
Architecture.

99
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,161
You know what that is?

100
00:08:24,162 --> 00:08:26,121
- Yes.
- What?

101
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:32,661
You see, she doesn't know.

102
00:08:34,796 --> 00:08:38,040
- Neither do I.
- Oh, you've had too much wine.

103
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:39,467
It's filthy wine.

104
00:08:39,468 --> 00:08:43,345
It takes the enamel off your teeth and
leaves it on the roof of your mouth.

105
00:08:43,346 --> 00:08:46,213
- Where was I?
- Architecture.

106
00:08:46,557 --> 00:08:48,766
Oh, yes. Look...

107
00:08:48,767 --> 00:08:50,927
I'll explain.

108
00:08:51,894 --> 00:08:55,597
This, my dear, is called an arch.

109
00:09:43,564 --> 00:09:49,235
The arch, my dear, is perhaps the
oldest of architectural devices.

110
00:09:49,236 --> 00:09:51,729
Arch. Architecture.

111
00:09:52,364 --> 00:09:56,742
The very word will tell you how
inextricably the two are one.

112
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,035
In a word, my dear,

113
00:09:58,036 --> 00:10:02,330
architecture is the most
ancient of the arts.

114
00:10:02,331 --> 00:10:06,450
Just as yours is the most
ancient of the professions.

115
00:10:06,584 --> 00:10:10,746
You'd better put your shoe on,
or you'll get cold feet.

116
00:10:13,382 --> 00:10:17,218
If you please, I'd like to go now.
The air raid seems to be over.

117
00:10:17,219 --> 00:10:19,304
Catherine!

118
00:10:19,305 --> 00:10:21,338
Catherine!

119
00:10:21,431 --> 00:10:24,308
- Catherine!
- Here I am, Fergy. I'm coming.

120
00:10:24,309 --> 00:10:27,185
- Oh, I worried. Oh!
- Oh.

121
00:10:27,186 --> 00:10:29,103
- You think I'd been blown away?
- I didn't know what to think.

122
00:10:29,104 --> 00:10:30,897
Nobody saw where you went.

123
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,182
Who's that man?

124
00:10:33,192 --> 00:10:36,644
Oh, I don't know.
Some lunatic. Come on.

125
00:10:45,452 --> 00:10:47,995
What if we take the
mountains to the north?

126
00:10:47,996 --> 00:10:51,122
Behind them are more mountains,
and behind those, more yet.

127
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:54,750
And we take them all only if
the Austrians stop fighting.

128
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:56,377
One side must stop.

129
00:10:56,378 --> 00:10:59,830
- Stop? It will go on forever.
- Like him.

130
00:11:09,932 --> 00:11:12,891
The Priest wants the
Austrians to win the war.

131
00:11:12,892 --> 00:11:16,311
- No, no, no. It is not true.
- But you don't want us to attack.

132
00:11:16,312 --> 00:11:20,273
If we must have war,
I suppose we have to attack.

133
00:11:20,274 --> 00:11:22,484
Oh, but so many die that way.

134
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:24,986
But what is death to a Christian.

135
00:11:36,497 --> 00:11:38,698
Don't encourage him, Fergy.

136
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:41,500
Frederico.

137
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,293
- Oh, you are back safe.
- Hello, Father.

138
00:11:43,294 --> 00:11:46,087
- I am so glad.
- The Priest prayed for you, Frederico.

139
00:11:46,088 --> 00:11:49,757
- Every time you go out he does the same.
- Oh, I pray for you all.

140
00:11:49,758 --> 00:11:52,343
You are late, baby.
How is it up there? Quiet?

141
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:55,804
You nearly missed the party.
But it is very dull.

142
00:11:55,805 --> 00:11:59,015
But Miss Barkley is here,
and her friend Miss Ferguson.

143
00:11:59,016 --> 00:12:02,009
The one you will like. Come.

144
00:12:06,523 --> 00:12:08,690
Miss Barkley, permit
me to present to you

145
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:11,567
my friend and war brother,
Lieutenant Henry.

146
00:12:11,568 --> 00:12:14,028
He has just returned
back from the front.

147
00:12:14,029 --> 00:12:17,364
How do you do?

148
00:12:17,365 --> 00:12:20,409
And this is Miss Ferguson.

149
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:23,036
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

150
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:26,289
Now he begins again, that fellow.

151
00:12:26,290 --> 00:12:29,450
Quick, let us go into the garden.

152
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,225
Now, you stay here.

153
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:53,813
I will find something for us to drink.
Asti? Grappa? Vermouth?

154
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:55,690
- Which do you like?
- All of them.

155
00:12:55,691 --> 00:12:58,809
Then you shall have all of them.

156
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:17,950
- Nice out here.
- Hmm, isn't it?

157
00:13:20,921 --> 00:13:24,465
We seem fated to bump into
each other in the dark.

158
00:13:24,466 --> 00:13:27,676
I'm sorry about that.
I mistook you for someone else.

159
00:13:27,677 --> 00:13:29,920
So I gathered.

160
00:13:30,221 --> 00:13:33,798
- I had been drinking.
- I gathered that, too.

161
00:13:33,932 --> 00:13:36,008
- Mad?
- No.

162
00:13:36,935 --> 00:13:39,519
- You're an American, aren't you?
- Yes.

163
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:42,105
Well, then what are you
doing in the Italian army?

164
00:13:42,106 --> 00:13:45,441
It's not really the army,
it's only the ambulance.

165
00:13:45,442 --> 00:13:48,236
It's very odd, though.
Why did you do it?

166
00:13:48,237 --> 00:13:50,195
I don't know. Why did you?

167
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,614
Oh, I joined up in England.

168
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:56,526
Besides, the boy I was
engaged to had gone across.

169
00:14:01,206 --> 00:14:05,041
- Where is Miss Ferguson?
- Why don't you go see?

170
00:14:05,042 --> 00:14:07,618
Yes, do bring her out,
Captain Rinaldi.

171
00:14:19,472 --> 00:14:21,923
- Have some?
- Thanks.

172
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,102
He's sore.

173
00:14:26,103 --> 00:14:27,478
What for?

174
00:14:27,479 --> 00:14:29,480
Because I'm here with you.

175
00:14:29,481 --> 00:14:32,349
Women prefer him, as a rule.

176
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:38,688
Shall we take a walk?

177
00:14:38,864 --> 00:14:40,564
Yes, let's.

178
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,951
Where is he now?

179
00:14:44,952 --> 00:14:47,745
- Who?
- The boy you're engaged to.

180
00:14:47,746 --> 00:14:50,165
- He's dead.
- Oh.

181
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,500
He was killed in the Somme.

182
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:54,168
Were you engaged long?

183
00:14:54,169 --> 00:14:56,628
Eight years. We grew up together.

184
00:14:56,629 --> 00:14:58,630
Why didn't you marry?

185
00:14:58,631 --> 00:15:02,083
I didn't know what the
war was like then.

186
00:15:02,217 --> 00:15:06,629
If I had it to do over again,
I'd marry him, or anything.

187
00:15:14,144 --> 00:15:16,521
When I joined up,
I remember having this silly idea

188
00:15:16,522 --> 00:15:19,356
that he might come to the
hospital where I was,

189
00:15:19,357 --> 00:15:22,693
with a sabre cut, I suppose,
and a bandage around his head.

190
00:15:22,694 --> 00:15:26,362
Shot through the shoulder.
Something picturesque.

191
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:29,199
This is a picturesque front.
Not France.

192
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,867
He didn't have a sabre cut.

193
00:15:31,868 --> 00:15:34,444
They blew him to bits.

194
00:16:21,245 --> 00:16:23,287
What are you thinking about now?

195
00:16:23,288 --> 00:16:25,456
About whisky.

196
00:16:25,457 --> 00:16:27,290
What about whisky?

197
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:29,751
About how nice it is.

198
00:16:29,752 --> 00:16:31,961
And you're nice, too.

199
00:16:36,716 --> 00:16:38,092
No.

200
00:16:38,093 --> 00:16:39,468
- Why not?
- No, don't.

201
00:16:39,469 --> 00:16:41,795
- Yes.
- No, please!

202
00:16:47,518 --> 00:16:49,434
I'm sorry. Did I hurt you?

203
00:16:49,435 --> 00:16:50,895
It's all right.

204
00:16:50,896 --> 00:16:53,805
I'm dreadfully sorry. Really.

205
00:16:54,023 --> 00:16:59,102
I... I just couldn't bear the
nurses'-evening-off aspect of it.

206
00:16:59,653 --> 00:17:02,613
It's quite all right.
I don't mind at all.

207
00:17:02,614 --> 00:17:04,281
Poor man.

208
00:17:04,282 --> 00:17:08,526
You see, I've been leading
a funny sort of life.

209
00:17:08,827 --> 00:17:11,621
Besides, you're so very beautiful.

210
00:17:11,622 --> 00:17:16,033
You don't have to talk a lot
of nonsense, I said I'm sorry.

211
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:19,661
We could get along.

212
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:21,730
Couldn't we?

213
00:17:22,131 --> 00:17:23,589
You're sweet.

214
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:26,751
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you're a dear.

215
00:17:27,803 --> 00:17:32,256
I'd be very glad to have you
kiss me now, if you don't mind.

216
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:12,006
You are looking for someone?

217
00:18:12,007 --> 00:18:14,926
- Have you seen Miss Barkley?
- Miss Barkley?

218
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:18,221
- Didn't she go out there with you?
- With me?

219
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:21,715
- No, no, no.
- But just a little while ago...

220
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,185
I thought I saw her go
out to the garden gate

221
00:18:25,186 --> 00:18:26,311
with the Lieutenant Henry.

222
00:18:26,312 --> 00:18:28,980
She went out with an officer? Alone?

223
00:18:28,981 --> 00:18:32,608
Well, perhaps I was mistaken,
you know, it is quite dark out there.

224
00:18:32,609 --> 00:18:34,068
Oh, she wouldn't do that.

225
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:37,228
No. No, I am sure I was mistaken.

226
00:18:37,697 --> 00:18:40,148
Where is she, then?

227
00:18:43,535 --> 00:18:45,495
You're a grand girl.

228
00:18:45,496 --> 00:18:47,204
I'm a crazy girl.

229
00:18:47,205 --> 00:18:49,706
- Why?
- To stay out here.

230
00:18:49,707 --> 00:18:52,617
It's nice. Isn't that enough?

231
00:18:59,007 --> 00:19:01,884
Hmm, it's nice. I suppose
that has to be enough

232
00:19:01,885 --> 00:19:04,719
for people who are living as we live.

233
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:07,347
Back home, I'd have courted
you and sent you flowers.

234
00:19:07,348 --> 00:19:10,842
Out here, you crowd
it all into one hour.

235
00:19:11,601 --> 00:19:15,220
Isn't that the way it's
got to be, out here?

236
00:19:15,397 --> 00:19:17,347
Look...

237
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:22,067
Tomorrow morning I've got
to go up to the front again.

238
00:19:22,068 --> 00:19:26,438
And if a shell got me and
you never saw me again,

239
00:19:28,408 --> 00:19:33,277
then we'd both be sorry that
we've been so formal and waited.

240
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:38,499
Besides, what's there so fine in
putting it off, dragging it out,

241
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,584
- giving me your lips tonight...
- No...

242
00:19:40,585 --> 00:19:42,169
- ... your throat tomorrow...
- No.

243
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,455
No, wait. No, please... No...

244
00:19:51,428 --> 00:19:56,464
Catherine?

245
00:20:00,161 --> 00:20:01,727
Thanks for the lovely concert.

246
00:20:01,728 --> 00:20:03,270
- I...
- I hope you are not worried

247
00:20:03,271 --> 00:20:04,438
about Miss Barkley.

248
00:20:04,439 --> 00:20:06,523
It's not like her to
disappear this way.

249
00:20:06,524 --> 00:20:08,983
Well, perhaps she felt ill
and went home alone.

250
00:20:08,984 --> 00:20:11,069
Perhaps. Good night.

251
00:20:11,070 --> 00:20:13,479
Come, girls, come.

252
00:20:21,287 --> 00:20:23,288
Why didn't you tell me?

253
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:25,457
It doesn't matter.

254
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:27,625
If it had to happen,
I'd rather it were like this.

255
00:20:27,626 --> 00:20:28,793
I couldn't know.

256
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,295
In a church or out under the stars.

257
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:35,131
- Well, why not?
- "Why not"? There's a war on.

258
00:20:35,132 --> 00:20:39,002
And tonight, who cares,
and tomorrow, who knows.

259
00:20:41,305 --> 00:20:43,973
What did you say your name was?

260
00:20:43,974 --> 00:20:46,091
Stop it.

261
00:20:47,977 --> 00:20:50,103
If you...

262
00:20:50,104 --> 00:20:54,932
If you knew how I was back home,
you'd see the funny side of it.

263
00:20:55,317 --> 00:20:56,984
Please, stop it.

264
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:05,024
Oh!

265
00:21:05,493 --> 00:21:08,870
We blame everything on
the war, but that's rot.

266
00:21:08,871 --> 00:21:11,738
It's something in ourselves.

267
00:21:15,417 --> 00:21:21,455
The lady sat in the public square
and mourned her lost innocence.

268
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:24,799
Don't be sorry.

269
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:26,876
I'm not.

270
00:21:27,428 --> 00:21:29,546
I love you.

271
00:21:32,557 --> 00:21:34,717
Oh, darling.

272
00:21:56,037 --> 00:21:59,339
Did you have a nice, uh, time, baby?

273
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:02,041
You made progress with her, eh?

274
00:22:02,042 --> 00:22:04,043
We're friends.
If that's what you mean.

275
00:22:04,044 --> 00:22:05,544
I mean, uh...

276
00:22:05,545 --> 00:22:08,880
Was she nice to you,
practically speaking?

277
00:22:08,881 --> 00:22:11,507
- Shut up!
- I am a man of extreme delicacy,

278
00:22:11,508 --> 00:22:13,884
- but was she...
- Rinaldi!

279
00:22:13,885 --> 00:22:15,719
Will you please shut up?

280
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:17,888
If you wanna be a
friend of mine, shut up.

281
00:22:17,889 --> 00:22:21,224
I am your best friend
and your war brother.

282
00:22:21,225 --> 00:22:23,425
Then shut up.

283
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:29,014
Miss Barkley prefers you
to me. That is very clear.

284
00:22:29,732 --> 00:22:33,559
But Miss Ferguson is very nice, too.

285
00:22:34,445 --> 00:22:36,146
You like her?

286
00:22:36,322 --> 00:22:38,105
No.

287
00:23:08,808 --> 00:23:11,351
That you of all people...

288
00:23:11,352 --> 00:23:14,770
A lot of geese, that's what
you are! Silly geese!

289
00:23:14,771 --> 00:23:18,107
Stuffed with bunk about
woman's part in the war.

290
00:23:18,108 --> 00:23:20,442
We must bring solace
to the men who fight,

291
00:23:20,443 --> 00:23:23,462
sacrifice ourselves, give ourselves.

292
00:23:24,989 --> 00:23:28,824
If you'd known him for a long time,
or been in love with him...

293
00:23:28,825 --> 00:23:31,660
But you only met him tonight.

294
00:23:31,661 --> 00:23:35,497
How long must you know a
man before you can love him?

295
00:23:35,498 --> 00:23:38,366
Are you pretending to be
in love with that man?

296
00:23:38,792 --> 00:23:41,327
I think I am, Fergy.

297
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:43,579
I must be.

298
00:23:43,797 --> 00:23:46,165
Or it couldn't have happened.

299
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:49,467
You're just another conquest to him.

300
00:23:49,468 --> 00:23:51,177
One in a hundred.

301
00:23:51,178 --> 00:23:54,505
You'll probably never see him again.

302
00:23:55,641 --> 00:24:00,310
He said if he'd met me back home,
he'd have courted me,

303
00:24:00,311 --> 00:24:02,687
sent me flowers...

304
00:24:02,688 --> 00:24:04,764
But now...

305
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:09,268
I suppose I won't ever see him again.

306
00:24:35,509 --> 00:24:37,551
Ciao, baby.

307
00:24:37,552 --> 00:24:39,294
Good luck.

308
00:25:21,006 --> 00:25:22,591
- Turn back.
- Back?

309
00:25:22,592 --> 00:25:24,667
Yes, back!

310
00:25:55,411 --> 00:25:58,663
- I wanna see Miss Barkley.
- She's on duty.

311
00:25:58,664 --> 00:26:01,365
Wait, you can't go in there.

312
00:26:23,353 --> 00:26:25,436
Hey, why have you come
back in here for?

313
00:26:25,437 --> 00:26:27,939
The Tenente, he knows
what he's doing. Please.

314
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
What's wrong, Bonello?
Going to ever get started here?

315
00:26:29,941 --> 00:26:31,359
We got plenty of time.

316
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,602
Oh, the...

317
00:26:33,862 --> 00:26:35,737
I thought you started.
What are you doing here?

318
00:26:35,738 --> 00:26:39,574
We come back, Signor Capitano.
Tenente forgot something.

319
00:26:39,575 --> 00:26:41,317
Oh.

320
00:27:01,886 --> 00:27:05,013
Hi. You're all right, aren't you?

321
00:27:05,014 --> 00:27:07,182
Yes, I'm all right.

322
00:27:07,183 --> 00:27:08,974
I came to...

323
00:27:08,975 --> 00:27:11,218
I thought...

324
00:27:11,687 --> 00:27:13,687
You see...

325
00:27:13,688 --> 00:27:16,398
I... I'm going to be
away for a while,

326
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:20,777
and I didn't want you to think
that I'd just gone away.

327
00:27:20,778 --> 00:27:22,486
No, I...

328
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:24,447
What I mean is,

329
00:27:24,448 --> 00:27:27,032
I'd hate to have you feel that...

330
00:27:27,033 --> 00:27:31,036
That it wasn't important
to me. About...

331
00:27:31,037 --> 00:27:32,779
About us.

332
00:27:32,996 --> 00:27:36,165
Uh, I don't exactly
know how to say it.

333
00:27:36,166 --> 00:27:39,785
You've said it very nicely,
dear, thank you.

334
00:27:40,503 --> 00:27:42,996
No, I don't mean...

335
00:27:43,005 --> 00:27:46,216
- You mustn't feel...
- Will you be gone long?

336
00:27:46,217 --> 00:27:47,800
No.

337
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:50,385
Only a few days.
There's gonna be a show above...

338
00:27:50,386 --> 00:27:52,512
Up above Plava.
Nothing much, I guess.

339
00:27:52,513 --> 00:27:55,515
A show? You'll be careful, won't you?

340
00:27:55,516 --> 00:27:57,884
I won't get hit.

341
00:27:58,268 --> 00:28:00,011
Hold this.

342
00:28:05,525 --> 00:28:07,350
Here.

343
00:28:07,861 --> 00:28:10,395
It's a Saint Anthony.

344
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:19,486
They say a Saint Anthony is very
useful to guard you from harm.

345
00:28:20,079 --> 00:28:22,906
I'll take good care of him.

346
00:28:28,379 --> 00:28:30,913
I wish I could kiss you.

347
00:28:45,810 --> 00:28:47,685
He is my friend and a good soldier.

348
00:28:47,686 --> 00:28:51,606
I do not like to see him
lose his head over a woman.

349
00:28:51,607 --> 00:28:53,440
Aren't you exaggerating a bit?

350
00:28:53,441 --> 00:28:54,650
I think not.

351
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:56,527
Couldn't we send her
back to the base, Major?

352
00:28:56,528 --> 00:29:00,572
Oh, if you could send her away,
it would simplify everything.

353
00:29:00,573 --> 00:29:02,573
Could perhaps send her to Milan.

354
00:29:02,574 --> 00:29:04,409
Excellent, my dear Major!
Magnificent!

355
00:29:04,410 --> 00:29:08,070
No wonder the English
are first in diplomacy.

356
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,368
Er, what did you say her name was?

357
00:29:22,008 --> 00:29:25,177
We won't get anything else
to eat once the attack starts.

358
00:29:25,178 --> 00:29:27,470
This is all they've given me.

359
00:29:27,471 --> 00:29:29,472
Starting to eat, Tenente?

360
00:29:29,473 --> 00:29:33,350
No, we'll all eat together.
Come on, sit down to it.

361
00:29:38,105 --> 00:29:41,141
- Thank you.
- Here, you cut this.

362
00:29:51,117 --> 00:29:53,234
Here, take some cheese, it is good.

363
00:29:55,454 --> 00:29:58,531
Wash it down with wine, Tenente.

364
00:29:59,624 --> 00:30:00,708
Who goes to the attack?

365
00:30:16,973 --> 00:30:18,674
Bersaglieri.

366
00:30:19,350 --> 00:30:23,186
If nobody would attack,
the war would be over.

367
00:30:35,990 --> 00:30:37,615
That was a big one.

368
00:30:37,616 --> 00:30:40,743
- Four hundred twenty?
- No, 305.

369
00:30:40,744 --> 00:30:44,904
- Sounded like a Skoda to me.
- Skoda, that's what I say.

370
00:31:03,555 --> 00:31:06,098
Are you badly hit, Tenente?

371
00:31:06,099 --> 00:31:08,350
Anybody hurt?

372
00:31:08,351 --> 00:31:10,677
My leg.

373
00:31:12,396 --> 00:31:15,056
Hold my neck, Tenente.

374
00:31:16,025 --> 00:31:19,527
You were right, Tenente.
It was a Skoda gun.

375
00:31:19,528 --> 00:31:21,436
Easy, watch out!

376
00:31:22,822 --> 00:31:24,531
Lacerations of the scalp

377
00:31:24,532 --> 00:31:26,949
and possible fracture of the skull.

378
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,120
Multiple superficial wounds
of the left and right thigh,

379
00:31:31,121 --> 00:31:34,039
left and right knee, and right foot.

380
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,376
Profound wounds of right knee
and foot incurred in line of duty.

381
00:31:38,377 --> 00:31:40,870
Anti-tetanus, please.

382
00:31:51,972 --> 00:31:54,390
- Come on, lift him up a little more.
- All right.

383
00:31:54,391 --> 00:31:56,425
Carefully!

384
00:32:08,779 --> 00:32:10,979
Hurry, hurry!

385
00:32:11,781 --> 00:32:14,399
How do you feel, baby?

386
00:32:15,034 --> 00:32:17,452
Rinaldi. What are you doing here?

387
00:32:17,453 --> 00:32:19,579
Bonello telephoned me.

388
00:32:19,580 --> 00:32:22,072
The Major gave me permission to come.

389
00:32:23,249 --> 00:32:26,210
No one shall hurt you, baby.
I won't let them.

390
00:32:26,211 --> 00:32:28,545
No butcher is going to
touch my war brother.

391
00:32:28,546 --> 00:32:31,715
Only Rinaldi can take
you and never hurt you.

392
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:34,883
You must forgive me, baby,
for talking so much, but I am...

393
00:32:34,884 --> 00:32:38,261
I'm very moved to see
you badly wounded.

394
00:32:38,262 --> 00:32:39,888
How did it happen?

395
00:32:39,889 --> 00:32:41,723
I will see you are
decorated for bravery.

396
00:32:41,724 --> 00:32:43,558
Perhaps we can get you
the medaglia d'argento,

397
00:32:43,559 --> 00:32:46,227
but surely the bronze one.
Did you carry somebody on your back?

398
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:49,271
I didn't carry anybody.
I couldn't move.

399
00:32:49,272 --> 00:32:52,733
Surely there was something heroic.
Tell me what you did.

400
00:32:52,734 --> 00:32:55,685
I was blown up eating cheese.

401
00:32:57,613 --> 00:33:00,823
Don't worry, baby. I will fix you
so that you are as good as new.

402
00:33:00,824 --> 00:33:05,285
You will see. Every day, I learn
to do things smoother, quicker.

403
00:33:05,286 --> 00:33:08,822
Soon, very soon,
you will be walking again.

404
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:11,790
I brought a present for you.

405
00:33:11,791 --> 00:33:14,710
You will find it under your
blanket, next to your heart.

406
00:33:14,711 --> 00:33:17,921
It is a bottle of brandy, baby.
Very good brandy.

407
00:33:17,922 --> 00:33:21,758
The infantry captured it from
the Austrians on San Gabriele.

408
00:33:21,759 --> 00:33:23,676
I have another surprise for you.

409
00:33:23,677 --> 00:33:25,552
Take a deep breath.

410
00:33:25,553 --> 00:33:28,014
Where do you think
you will go from here?

411
00:33:28,015 --> 00:33:32,809
To the Italian hospital where they have
the male nurses with the beards? No.

412
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,521
I will arrange everything with
my friend, the British Major.

413
00:33:36,522 --> 00:33:40,550
You will go to Milan. To the
beautiful Miss Barkley.

414
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:43,027
That makes you happy, huh?

415
00:33:43,028 --> 00:33:46,237
Think of Rinaldi,
left all alone with the war.

416
00:33:46,238 --> 00:33:49,741
No one to make fun of.
No one to lend him money.

417
00:33:49,742 --> 00:33:51,492
While you...

418
00:33:51,493 --> 00:33:55,203
While you are in Milan with
the beautiful Miss Barkley.

419
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:59,699
Making love in Milan to
the chaste Miss Barkley.

420
00:34:21,519 --> 00:34:24,137
Look out for the step.

421
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:46,040
Why do you stop?

422
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,460
I am the superintendent. May I
have your medical papers, please?

423
00:34:49,461 --> 00:34:53,288
They're in my coat.
In the buttoned-down pocket.

424
00:34:54,131 --> 00:34:56,382
Take him up those stairs,
down the corridor.

425
00:34:56,383 --> 00:35:00,419
His room is the one at the end.
You show them, Giulio.

426
00:35:00,511 --> 00:35:02,596
Who are you?

427
00:35:02,597 --> 00:35:05,056
I am the porter, Signor Tenente.

428
00:35:05,057 --> 00:35:07,383
Come, follow me.

429
00:35:17,526 --> 00:35:20,069
Now, Signor Tenente,
we must lift you off the bed.

430
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:24,481
- All right. But keep my legs straight.
- Si, Signor Tenente.

431
00:35:27,076 --> 00:35:28,494
Anything more, Signor Tenente?

432
00:35:28,495 --> 00:35:31,579
- Get me some brandy.
- No, it's not allowed, Signor Tenente.

433
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:34,915
Wasn't I wounded,
fighting for the glory of Italy?

434
00:35:34,916 --> 00:35:38,869
- You'll find some money in my pocket.
- As you wish.

435
00:35:44,174 --> 00:35:46,050
- So it's you.
- Ferguson.

436
00:35:46,051 --> 00:35:48,469
- Is Catherine here?
- As if you didn't know.

437
00:35:48,470 --> 00:35:49,928
I believe that's why you got wounded.

438
00:35:49,929 --> 00:35:51,722
- Where is she?
- You ought to be still.

439
00:35:51,723 --> 00:35:54,474
Here's your chart.
I must take your temperature.

440
00:35:54,475 --> 00:35:57,135
Does she know I'm here?

441
00:35:57,311 --> 00:35:59,846
Under the arm, please.

442
00:36:07,737 --> 00:36:10,563
- Hello, darling.
- Catherine.

443
00:36:11,698 --> 00:36:13,032
You're lovely.

444
00:36:13,033 --> 00:36:15,660
- Are you badly hurt?
- You're lovely.

445
00:36:15,661 --> 00:36:17,286
Oh, my poor darling.
It's your leg, isn't it?

446
00:36:17,287 --> 00:36:20,197
- You're the loveliest thing I ever saw.
- Oh...

447
00:36:23,959 --> 00:36:25,877
I have to go now,
darling, I can't stay.

448
00:36:25,878 --> 00:36:26,961
- You'll come back?
- Later.

449
00:36:26,962 --> 00:36:29,004
- But we have to be awfully careful.
- You've got to come back.

450
00:36:29,005 --> 00:36:30,589
I will, when I can.

451
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:33,041
- Tonight?
- I'll try.

452
00:36:33,717 --> 00:36:36,085
Somebody's coming.

453
00:36:36,304 --> 00:36:38,004
Tonight.

454
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:46,302
I'll take that thermometer now.

455
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:51,224
Good gracious!

456
00:36:51,442 --> 00:36:53,734
Fetch the doctor.

457
00:36:53,735 --> 00:36:56,695
It's a miracle you're not
delirious with such a fever.

458
00:36:56,696 --> 00:37:00,315
- I haven't got any fever.
- Stay quiet, please.

459
00:37:00,616 --> 00:37:03,217
It's not what you think.

460
00:37:27,348 --> 00:37:28,848
I have brought you
a few little things.

461
00:37:28,849 --> 00:37:31,892
And this is mosquito netting,
and this is a bottle of vermouth.

462
00:37:31,893 --> 00:37:34,353
You like vermouth, huh?

463
00:37:34,354 --> 00:37:37,439
- And these are English papers.
- Thank you, Father.

464
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,565
It's very good of you to come.

465
00:37:38,566 --> 00:37:41,525
Oh, but I mustn't stay long.
They warned me not to tire you.

466
00:37:41,526 --> 00:37:43,486
You seem very tired yourself.

467
00:37:43,487 --> 00:37:45,863
I am tired, but I
have no right to be.

468
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:48,782
- You have the war disgust.
- No.

469
00:37:48,783 --> 00:37:50,784
But I hate the war.

470
00:37:50,785 --> 00:37:53,495
- I don't enjoy it.
- But you do not mind it.

471
00:37:53,496 --> 00:37:55,037
You do not see it.

472
00:37:55,038 --> 00:37:57,498
Oh, you must forgive me.
I know you are wounded.

473
00:37:57,499 --> 00:37:58,833
That was an accident.

474
00:37:58,834 --> 00:38:00,959
Still, even wounded,
you do not see it.

475
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,922
I can tell. I do not see it myself,
but I feel it a little.

476
00:38:06,023 --> 00:38:08,374
Come in, Cat.

477
00:38:10,051 --> 00:38:12,302
Don't go yet, Father.
It's still early.

478
00:38:12,303 --> 00:38:15,555
You are sure? With the operation
in the morning, he should rest.

479
00:38:15,556 --> 00:38:16,890
Oh, he's strong.

480
00:38:16,891 --> 00:38:19,559
He has such a lovely temperature.
It is always normal.

481
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:21,394
I'm very proud of his temperature.

482
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:23,854
Maybe all our children will
have fine temperatures, too.

483
00:38:23,855 --> 00:38:27,641
Our children will probably
have beastly temperatures.

484
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:31,069
Don't mind us, Father. We're in love.

485
00:38:31,070 --> 00:38:34,564
I know. I could see it in your faces.

486
00:38:35,282 --> 00:38:38,317
You approve, don't you, Father?

487
00:38:38,618 --> 00:38:41,237
You spoke of children.

488
00:38:42,955 --> 00:38:48,451
This, too, is the war. Without the war,
you would have married in God's grace.

489
00:38:49,878 --> 00:38:51,579
Is it not so?

490
00:38:55,925 --> 00:38:58,026
And you?

491
00:39:00,679 --> 00:39:03,914
I hadn't thought about
it like that, but...

492
00:39:04,266 --> 00:39:06,467
Yes, I suppose so.

493
00:39:26,285 --> 00:39:28,578
Father, are you...

494
00:39:28,579 --> 00:39:31,530
Is that the marriage service?

495
00:39:48,554 --> 00:39:50,680
Of course you realise, Father,

496
00:39:50,681 --> 00:39:54,341
that army regulations
prevent us from marrying?

497
00:39:54,601 --> 00:39:57,511
They'd send Catherine home.

498
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:13,325
Poor Cat. Such a crazy marriage.

499
00:40:13,326 --> 00:40:15,944
At least I'm in white.

500
00:40:17,246 --> 00:40:18,496
No orange blossoms.

501
00:40:18,497 --> 00:40:20,864
I can smell them.

502
00:40:22,166 --> 00:40:23,208
No organ music.

503
00:40:23,209 --> 00:40:24,918
I can hear it plainly.

504
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,717
It was a foolish notion, perhaps.

505
00:40:43,019 --> 00:40:45,728
I have not the right to
say you are married.

506
00:40:45,729 --> 00:40:48,939
Yet, it has made me happy to do this.

507
00:40:48,940 --> 00:40:51,900
For now, from my heart, I can
say I bless you in His name.

508
00:40:51,901 --> 00:40:54,310
Thank you, Father.

509
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,446
Goodbye and be happy, both of you.

510
00:40:57,447 --> 00:40:59,857
Thank you, Father.

511
00:41:00,284 --> 00:41:03,493
- Give my regards to the mess.
- I will.

512
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:07,789
And get well soon. I will come
again the next time I am in Milan.

513
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:10,742
- Goodbye, my dear.
- Goodbye.

514
00:41:16,548 --> 00:41:18,540
Is Miss Barkley here?

515
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:20,834
Uh-uh.

516
00:41:21,677 --> 00:41:24,170
No. No!

517
00:41:35,648 --> 00:41:37,065
Shut the door.

518
00:41:37,066 --> 00:41:39,850
- I can't.
- Please, darling.

519
00:41:48,284 --> 00:41:50,618
We mustn't.
Your operation's in the morning.

520
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:52,444
It's our wedding night.

521
00:41:52,913 --> 00:41:54,946
Oh, darling.

522
00:41:56,749 --> 00:41:58,583
You'll have to take your oil.

523
00:41:58,584 --> 00:42:00,001
Castor oil? No.

524
00:42:00,002 --> 00:42:01,419
You'll take it from me.

525
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:03,963
- I'll take anything from you...
- Darling.

526
00:42:03,964 --> 00:42:05,990
if you stay.

527
00:42:07,217 --> 00:42:09,709
Oh, darling, darling.

528
00:42:10,095 --> 00:42:11,177
I want what you want.

529
00:42:11,178 --> 00:42:13,638
There isn't any "me" any more,
just what you want.

530
00:42:13,639 --> 00:42:15,882
You're sweet.

531
00:42:21,771 --> 00:42:23,771
Don't I make a lovely wife?

532
00:42:23,772 --> 00:42:26,683
Such a lovely wife.

533
00:42:29,152 --> 00:42:30,862
Feel our hearts beat.

534
00:42:30,863 --> 00:42:33,947
No wonder my heart beats.

535
00:42:33,948 --> 00:42:36,357
I'm mad about you.

536
00:43:47,054 --> 00:43:51,223
That's the opera I made
my debut in at La Scala.

537
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:53,850
- They threw benches at him.
- That's a lie!

538
00:43:53,851 --> 00:43:56,269
Yes, they did. I threw
six benches myself.

539
00:43:56,270 --> 00:43:58,679
That's not funny.

540
00:44:03,694 --> 00:44:05,194
Oh, now he is offended.

541
00:44:05,195 --> 00:44:08,488
He'll get over it. That's his sore spot.
We always tease him.

542
00:44:08,489 --> 00:44:10,198
You don't care whom you hurt.

543
00:44:10,199 --> 00:44:11,950
Now, don't you get mad, too.

544
00:44:11,951 --> 00:44:14,535
Catherine and I were thinking
of asking you to our wedding.

545
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:15,828
Weren't we, Cat?

546
00:44:15,829 --> 00:44:17,955
- You'll never get married.
- We will!

547
00:44:17,956 --> 00:44:20,540
No, you won't.
You'll fight before you marry.

548
00:44:20,541 --> 00:44:22,041
- Oh, we never fight.
- You've time yet.

549
00:44:22,042 --> 00:44:23,418
We won't fight ever.

550
00:44:23,419 --> 00:44:25,002
You'll die, then.

551
00:44:25,003 --> 00:44:28,247
Fight or die. That's what people do.

552
00:44:28,256 --> 00:44:31,333
- They don't marry.
- Why, Fergy!

553
00:44:32,510 --> 00:44:34,795
I'm not crying.

554
00:44:36,222 --> 00:44:38,848
Maybe you'll be all right, you two.

555
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:40,475
Watch out you don't
get her in trouble.

556
00:44:40,476 --> 00:44:43,227
- I won't get her into trouble.
- You better not.

557
00:44:43,228 --> 00:44:45,429
Or I'll kill you.

558
00:44:45,563 --> 00:44:47,647
Why, Fergy...

559
00:44:47,648 --> 00:44:49,983
What is the matter with her?

560
00:44:49,984 --> 00:44:51,442
She doesn't like me, that's all.

561
00:44:51,443 --> 00:44:54,770
Oh, no. She just likes me more.

562
00:45:01,202 --> 00:45:03,495
Are you on night duty tonight?

563
00:45:03,496 --> 00:45:05,913
Yes, but you won't care.
You'll go right off to sleep.

564
00:45:05,914 --> 00:45:08,082
You wait and see.

565
00:45:09,792 --> 00:45:13,419
Darling, how many other
girls have you ever loved?

566
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:14,545
None.

567
00:45:14,546 --> 00:45:16,256
How many, really?

568
00:45:16,257 --> 00:45:18,123
None.

569
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:20,885
How many have you, um...

570
00:45:20,886 --> 00:45:22,636
How do you say it...

571
00:45:22,637 --> 00:45:24,588
Loved?

572
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,390
- None.
- You're lying to me.

573
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:28,808
- Of course.
- Oh, that's right.

574
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:32,853
You just keep right on lying,
that's what I want you to do.

575
00:45:32,854 --> 00:45:34,438
Were they pretty?

576
00:45:34,439 --> 00:45:35,773
I have never been with anyone.

577
00:45:35,774 --> 00:45:38,391
That's right, darling.

578
00:45:38,985 --> 00:45:40,777
What were they like?

579
00:45:40,778 --> 00:45:42,737
I don't know anything about it.

580
00:45:42,738 --> 00:45:47,449
You're just mine. That's true.
You've never belonged to anyone else.

581
00:45:47,450 --> 00:45:49,410
I don't care if you have, though.
I'm not afraid of them.

582
00:45:49,411 --> 00:45:52,203
Only, don't tell me about them.

583
00:45:52,204 --> 00:45:54,039
You never told them you
loved them, did you?

584
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:56,866
- No.
- I knew you wouldn't.

585
00:45:57,334 --> 00:46:00,995
- Oh, darling, I do love you.
- Then, kiss me.

586
00:46:01,046 --> 00:46:04,080
- Right here on the street?
- Yes.

587
00:46:16,767 --> 00:46:19,093
I'll go in first.

588
00:46:30,071 --> 00:46:31,654
So...

589
00:46:31,655 --> 00:46:35,433
What is this, if I may ask?
What was in it?

590
00:46:36,117 --> 00:46:37,660
That's kummel.

591
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:40,745
That's the best kind. It comes in those
bear-shaped bottles from Russia.

592
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:42,781
And these?

593
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:45,625
That's brandy, wine and whisky.

594
00:46:45,626 --> 00:46:48,794
And I've been pitying you
for being wounded.

595
00:46:48,795 --> 00:46:51,088
Pity is something that
is wasted on you.

596
00:46:51,089 --> 00:46:52,339
- Thank you.
- If you're so anxious

597
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:53,841
not to go back to the front,

598
00:46:53,842 --> 00:46:56,384
I should think you'd try
something more intelligent.

599
00:46:56,385 --> 00:46:58,636
Not self-inflicted alcoholism!

600
00:46:58,637 --> 00:47:00,847
- What?
- I said, "Alcoholism!"

601
00:47:00,848 --> 00:47:06,009
And I also say that I'll see your
convalescent leave is cancelled.

602
00:47:06,353 --> 00:47:09,888
You'll go back to the
front tomorrow night.

603
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,709
Have I time for a drink
before the train leaves?

604
00:47:33,710 --> 00:47:35,002
- For the front?
- Yes.

605
00:47:35,003 --> 00:47:38,496
- About 20 minutes, Signor Capitano.
- Right.

606
00:48:07,906 --> 00:48:10,616
It's a fine room, a lovely room.

607
00:48:10,617 --> 00:48:12,200
It's all right.

608
00:48:12,201 --> 00:48:17,364
The red plush is just the thing.
Those mirrors are very attractive, too.

609
00:48:17,540 --> 00:48:20,707
People who go in for vice seem to
have very good taste about it.

610
00:48:20,708 --> 00:48:22,834
Hmm, you're a grand girl.

611
00:48:22,835 --> 00:48:25,161
Oh, darling.

612
00:48:27,048 --> 00:48:29,882
I wish we could do
something really simple.

613
00:48:29,883 --> 00:48:33,010
Everything we do seems
so innocent and right.

614
00:48:33,011 --> 00:48:34,929
You're a fine, simple girl.

615
00:48:34,930 --> 00:48:38,640
I am a simple girl.
Nobody but you ever realised it.

616
00:48:38,641 --> 00:48:41,017
At first, I thought you
were a crazy girl.

617
00:48:41,018 --> 00:48:43,102
I was a little crazy at first.

618
00:48:47,441 --> 00:48:48,857
Was that your train?

619
00:48:48,858 --> 00:48:50,192
Maybe.

620
00:48:50,193 --> 00:48:51,651
It makes up at Turin.

621
00:48:51,652 --> 00:48:54,904
But it stays in the station
here until time to leave.

622
00:48:54,905 --> 00:48:57,774
There's really lots of time.

623
00:49:01,453 --> 00:49:06,907
"But at my back, I always hear
Time's winged chariot hurrying near"

624
00:49:06,999 --> 00:49:09,792
I know that poem. It's by Marvell.

625
00:49:09,793 --> 00:49:13,746
Oh, it's about a girl who
wouldn't live with a man.

626
00:49:20,052 --> 00:49:22,003
Listen.

627
00:49:27,767 --> 00:49:29,643
It's only the rain.

628
00:49:29,644 --> 00:49:31,603
I hate the rain.

629
00:49:31,604 --> 00:49:32,854
I like it.

630
00:49:32,855 --> 00:49:35,106
I'm afraid of the rain.

631
00:49:35,107 --> 00:49:37,558
- Afraid, why?
- I...

632
00:49:37,985 --> 00:49:40,902
- Well, perhaps it's silly.
- What? Tell me.

633
00:49:40,903 --> 00:49:43,730
- No. Don't make me.
- Tell me.

634
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:45,857
All right.

635
00:49:45,908 --> 00:49:49,285
I'm afraid of the rain because
sometimes I see me dead in it.

636
00:49:49,286 --> 00:49:50,661
No!

637
00:49:50,662 --> 00:49:53,330
And sometimes I see you dead in it.

638
00:49:53,631 --> 00:49:57,167
- That's more likely.
- Oh, now, darling, don't say that.

639
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,581
That is your train.

640
00:50:04,674 --> 00:50:07,375
Time's winged chariot.

641
00:50:13,266 --> 00:50:14,516
I'll come with you, hmm?

642
00:50:14,517 --> 00:50:18,685
No, please, I don't want you...
Not... Not at the station.

643
00:50:18,686 --> 00:50:20,937
All right, darling.

644
00:50:20,938 --> 00:50:22,022
How often will you write?

645
00:50:22,023 --> 00:50:24,274
As often as I can.
Do they read your letters?

646
00:50:24,275 --> 00:50:26,192
They can't read English
enough to hurt anything.

647
00:50:26,193 --> 00:50:28,068
Well, I'll make them very confusing.

648
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:29,487
But not too confusing.

649
00:50:29,488 --> 00:50:31,697
Oh, I should have got
you a going-away gift.

650
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:34,033
A whistle to make you
feel better in the dark.

651
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:37,411
Or a sword. I'm sure we could
get a used sword very cheap.

652
00:50:37,412 --> 00:50:38,870
Swords aren't very
useful at the front.

653
00:50:38,871 --> 00:50:41,705
Oh, I see, they get in the way of
your legs when you're running.

654
00:50:41,706 --> 00:50:45,618
They might be useful at mess, though.

655
00:50:47,086 --> 00:50:50,413
I'm afraid I have to start, darling.

656
00:50:51,715 --> 00:50:54,300
I hate to leave our fine house.

657
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,293
So do I.

658
00:50:57,554 --> 00:51:00,847
We never stay settled very
long in a home, do we?

659
00:51:00,848 --> 00:51:02,799
We will.

660
00:51:03,392 --> 00:51:07,262
I'll have a fine home for
you when you come back.

661
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:10,723
Say, "I'll come back to Catherine."

662
00:51:11,524 --> 00:51:13,642
I'll come back to Catherine.

663
00:51:20,407 --> 00:51:22,983
I'll always come back.

664
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:29,664
Maybe this time, you'll be hurt
just a little in the foot.

665
00:51:29,665 --> 00:51:31,123
- Or the lobe of the ear.
- Oh, no, no, no.

666
00:51:31,124 --> 00:51:33,417
I want your ears just
the way they are.

667
00:51:33,418 --> 00:51:36,620
Your feet have been hurt already.

668
00:53:41,447 --> 00:53:43,113
I want a ticket to
Switzerland, please.

669
00:53:43,114 --> 00:53:45,616
- To where, signora, to what town?
- The nearest one to Italy.

670
00:53:45,617 --> 00:53:47,284
That would be Brissago, signora.

671
00:53:47,285 --> 00:53:49,078
- Then give me a ticket to Brissago.
- All right.

672
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,412
Oh...

673
00:53:50,413 --> 00:53:51,871
Oh, Fergy, I was afraid
you wouldn't come.

674
00:53:51,872 --> 00:53:53,707
Would you mind telling
me what this is all about?

675
00:53:53,708 --> 00:53:55,499
- I'm going away.
- So I gathered by this,

676
00:53:55,500 --> 00:53:57,043
but where? Why?

677
00:53:57,044 --> 00:53:59,537
To Switzerland, to have a baby.

678
00:53:59,963 --> 00:54:01,705
Oh.

679
00:54:02,298 --> 00:54:03,506
I knew he'd get you in trouble.

680
00:54:03,507 --> 00:54:04,882
Oh, now, it wasn't his
fault, really, Fergy.

681
00:54:04,883 --> 00:54:06,218
What's he going to do about it?

682
00:54:06,219 --> 00:54:07,677
He doesn't know it.

683
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:08,928
You didn't tell him?

684
00:54:08,929 --> 00:54:10,387
What would be the good?
It would only worry him.

685
00:54:10,388 --> 00:54:12,056
He'd have to go anyway.

686
00:54:12,057 --> 00:54:13,390
Aren't you going to tell him?

687
00:54:13,391 --> 00:54:17,427
Well, not yet. I may write
him from Switzerland.

688
00:54:18,062 --> 00:54:20,813
- You're a fool.
- Here, signora.

689
00:54:20,814 --> 00:54:22,773
- On Track 3.
- Thank you.

690
00:54:22,774 --> 00:54:24,233
What's the hurry? Why tonight?

691
00:54:24,234 --> 00:54:27,527
I couldn't go back to that hospital.
I couldn't stand it. Not with him gone.

692
00:54:27,528 --> 00:54:28,945
But you'll be all
alone in Switzerland.

693
00:54:28,946 --> 00:54:32,398
Don't worry, Fergy,
I'll be all right.

694
00:54:33,909 --> 00:54:36,027
You're not afraid of
anything, are you?

695
00:54:36,245 --> 00:54:39,454
Only of going back to that hospital.

696
00:54:39,455 --> 00:54:40,706
Don't scold me, Fergy.

697
00:54:44,168 --> 00:54:46,453
I'll carry it.

698
00:55:22,451 --> 00:55:24,786
"I've always told you
I was a crazy girl.

699
00:55:24,787 --> 00:55:27,163
"I couldn't bear Milan with you away.

700
00:55:27,164 --> 00:55:29,623
"So I've chucked the war and come
to live in this little Swiss town

701
00:55:29,624 --> 00:55:32,876
"as near as possible to the
Italian border and you.

702
00:55:32,877 --> 00:55:36,671
"And, darling, it's an adorable
place and we'll be very happy here.

703
00:55:36,672 --> 00:55:39,374
"I've taken a suite...

704
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,261
"... suite in the best hotel.

705
00:55:44,262 --> 00:55:46,721
"And I'm fairly wallowing in luxury.

706
00:55:46,722 --> 00:55:50,474
"The bed is Empire and
fit for an empress.

707
00:55:50,475 --> 00:55:53,311
"There's a maroon velvet
carpet, ankle-deep,

708
00:55:53,312 --> 00:55:56,480
"and a bathroom...
Oh, darling, the bathroom!

709
00:55:56,481 --> 00:56:00,058
"It's of black marble
with silver fittings.

710
00:56:00,318 --> 00:56:04,687
"I've just dined in state
at my sitting-room window,

711
00:56:04,863 --> 00:56:10,025
"from which there is a divine view of
the lake shimmering in moonlight."

712
00:56:21,252 --> 00:56:23,795
I'm an awful liar, darling.

713
00:56:23,796 --> 00:56:28,132
It's not really a nice place at all.
It's mean, cheap and horrible.

714
00:56:28,133 --> 00:56:30,093
But it doesn't matter where I live,

715
00:56:30,094 --> 00:56:34,380
because I don't really live
at all when I'm not with you.

716
00:56:35,014 --> 00:56:37,215
Oh, darling...

717
00:56:38,893 --> 00:56:42,354
What I really wanna
tell you is that...

718
00:56:42,355 --> 00:56:46,941
That I shall lie awake in the dark
and cry, because you're not here.

719
00:56:46,942 --> 00:56:49,726
I'm lonely and frightened.

720
00:56:49,902 --> 00:56:52,187
And I love you.

721
00:57:04,707 --> 00:57:06,375
- Hurry, baby.
- Why?

722
00:57:06,376 --> 00:57:08,376
- Time to go.
- Go where?

723
00:57:08,377 --> 00:57:10,086
But I told you before,
to the Villa Rossa.

724
00:57:10,087 --> 00:57:12,838
- New girls. Everybody's going.
- Not me.

725
00:57:12,839 --> 00:57:16,884
But you must. It will be a fine party.
And, besides, I said you would go.

726
00:57:16,885 --> 00:57:19,552
I can't. I've got to write a letter.

727
00:57:19,553 --> 00:57:21,721
Oh, to that little...

728
00:57:21,722 --> 00:57:24,556
Every day, more letters.
You might as well be married.

729
00:57:24,557 --> 00:57:26,308
That's my business.

730
00:57:26,309 --> 00:57:30,186
Oh, baby. How you
ever come back to me?

731
00:57:30,187 --> 00:57:32,730
Serious like a
shopkeeper with a liver.

732
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:34,815
Where is my war brother who
used to get drunk with me

733
00:57:34,816 --> 00:57:37,818
and go to the Villa
Rossa every night?

734
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:39,519
Leave me alone, will you?

735
00:57:40,530 --> 00:57:43,523
Why? Isn't she just a girl?

736
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:46,034
Keep her out of this.

737
00:57:46,035 --> 00:57:48,953
Sacred subject. Believe me, baby,

738
00:57:48,954 --> 00:57:52,531
sacred subjects are not
good for soldiers.

739
00:57:53,224 --> 00:57:56,626
Why don't you be like me?
All fire and smoke.

740
00:57:56,627 --> 00:57:58,461
And nothing inside.

741
00:57:58,962 --> 00:58:01,297
- Come on, baby.
- You're drunk, stop it.

742
00:58:01,298 --> 00:58:02,757
Of course I am drunk!

743
00:58:02,758 --> 00:58:05,051
You come with me and
you will be drunk, too.

744
00:58:05,052 --> 00:58:06,760
Come on, baby.

745
00:58:06,761 --> 00:58:11,331
Oh, I am sorry. Now you must come.
There is no more ink.

746
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:14,500
Get your hands off me and get out!

747
00:58:19,439 --> 00:58:20,981
Poor baby.

748
00:58:20,982 --> 00:58:24,108
Tomorrow I will get you drunk
and I will take out your liver

749
00:58:24,109 --> 00:58:26,277
and I will put you in
a good Italian liver

750
00:58:26,278 --> 00:58:28,654
and make a man of you again.

751
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:30,731
Ciao, baby.

752
00:58:40,999 --> 00:58:43,625
You're going out, Signor Capitano?

753
00:58:43,626 --> 00:58:47,128
- Yes, why?
- The mail just came, Signor Capitano.

754
00:58:47,129 --> 00:58:50,256
- You censor it.
- Signor capitano...

755
00:58:50,257 --> 00:58:52,958
The officers' mail, too?

756
00:58:55,303 --> 00:58:57,504
Very well.

757
00:59:08,857 --> 00:59:10,691
Aren't you gonna open them,
Signor Capitano?

758
00:59:10,692 --> 00:59:11,900
No!

759
00:59:11,901 --> 00:59:14,186
I'm in a hurry.

760
00:59:31,252 --> 00:59:33,669
- Send this one back.
- Yes, Signor Capitano.

761
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:36,922
I do not like to see him
lose his head over a woman.

762
00:59:36,923 --> 00:59:39,374
Yes, Signor capitano.

763
01:00:01,153 --> 01:00:04,070
And today my letters came back.
Every one I'd ever written to her.

764
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:05,196
Came back?

765
01:00:05,197 --> 01:00:07,824
Just marked "Return to sender.
Person unknown."

766
01:00:07,825 --> 01:00:09,742
Well, that's very strange.

767
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:11,869
Thirty-two letters.
She never got one.

768
01:00:11,870 --> 01:00:15,164
- Well, that's why she never wrote you.
- No.

769
01:00:15,165 --> 01:00:17,416
She'd have written me anyway.
Something's happened to her.

770
01:00:17,417 --> 01:00:21,085
- Have you tried to...
- I can't get any information at all.

771
01:00:21,086 --> 01:00:24,505
- I've got to go and find her myself.
- How can you?

772
01:00:24,506 --> 01:00:26,048
I'm going to Milan. I'll find her.

773
01:00:26,049 --> 01:00:28,050
But aren't all leaves
of absence forbidden

774
01:00:28,051 --> 01:00:29,968
since that battle in the north began?

775
01:00:29,969 --> 01:00:33,421
- I'm going anyway.
- No, that's desertion.

776
01:00:33,639 --> 01:00:36,223
- I don't care, I'm going.
- You'll be caught.

777
01:00:36,224 --> 01:00:39,560
- You mustn't do this, Frederico.
- Yes, I must.

778
01:00:39,561 --> 01:00:42,396
That's what I wanted
to tell you, Padre.

779
01:00:42,397 --> 01:00:44,272
What does this war
mean to me any more?

780
01:00:44,273 --> 01:00:46,066
What does anything mean,
but finding her?

781
01:00:46,067 --> 01:00:49,644
- But Frederico, consider the...
- I can depend on you, Padre?

782
01:00:53,657 --> 01:00:56,575
Say goodbye to Rinaldi
and the others for me.

783
01:00:56,576 --> 01:00:59,453
- When are you leaving?
- Now. While they are at dinner.

784
01:00:59,454 --> 01:01:02,446
And by morning, when they miss me,
I'll be halfway to Milan.

785
01:01:02,747 --> 01:01:05,208
If they ask me, what will I say? I...

786
01:01:05,209 --> 01:01:07,418
Anything you like.

787
01:01:07,419 --> 01:01:08,919
Goodbye, Padre.

788
01:01:08,920 --> 01:01:10,753
Goodbye, Frederico.

789
01:01:10,754 --> 01:01:13,998
May the Lord bless and preserve you.

790
01:07:27,250 --> 01:07:29,125
What are you carabinieri
doing in the yards?

791
01:07:29,126 --> 01:07:31,419
- Looking for stragglers.
- What do you do with them?

792
01:07:31,420 --> 01:07:33,587
Send them back to fight invaders.

793
01:07:33,588 --> 01:07:36,465
Every foot of Italian
soil must be regained.

794
01:07:36,466 --> 01:07:38,175
Suppose they don't want to go back?

795
01:07:38,176 --> 01:07:40,627
Then we shoot them.

796
01:07:57,443 --> 01:07:58,943
- Catherine.
- Who's that?

797
01:07:58,944 --> 01:08:01,561
Shh! Where's Catherine?

798
01:08:02,113 --> 01:08:05,407
- What are you doing back here?
- Where's Catherine?

799
01:08:05,408 --> 01:08:06,575
I know.

800
01:08:06,576 --> 01:08:09,035
You've run away. You're a deserter.

801
01:08:09,036 --> 01:08:12,405
- Where is she? I've got to see her.
- You can't. She's gone.

802
01:08:12,622 --> 01:08:15,783
- Gone? Where?
- And you'd better get out.

803
01:08:18,127 --> 01:08:20,462
- Has she been transferred?
- If you don't get out of here,

804
01:08:20,463 --> 01:08:23,297
I'll scream and bring the
whole hospital down on you.

805
01:08:23,298 --> 01:08:26,050
- Why'd she go. Where? Tell me.
- No!

806
01:08:26,051 --> 01:08:27,801
- Tell me where she is!
- Go ahead, choke me,

807
01:08:27,802 --> 01:08:30,053
but I won't tell you.
You've done her enough harm.

808
01:08:30,054 --> 01:08:32,597
- What do you mean?
- I said you'd get her into trouble.

809
01:08:32,598 --> 01:08:35,516
I hate you. Hate, you understand?
I won't tell you anything.

810
01:08:35,517 --> 01:08:37,226
Shh!

811
01:08:37,227 --> 01:08:39,854
I hope they catch you.
I hope they shoot you!

812
01:08:39,855 --> 01:08:41,730
Pay you back for what
you've done to her.

813
01:08:41,731 --> 01:08:44,349
Making her have a baby.

814
01:08:45,150 --> 01:08:47,736
- Baby?
- I warned you, but you didn't care.

815
01:08:47,737 --> 01:08:49,153
Not about her.

816
01:08:49,154 --> 01:08:51,655
- Now she's had to go away.
- Where?

817
01:08:51,656 --> 01:08:53,824
Where? Oh, for pity's sake,
tell me! Fergy!

818
01:08:53,825 --> 01:08:55,909
No, no! No!

819
01:08:58,204 --> 01:08:59,946
No!

820
01:08:59,997 --> 01:09:02,665
- We're coming, too!
- Be careful, girls.

821
01:09:02,666 --> 01:09:04,408
Where is he?

822
01:09:06,211 --> 01:09:11,798
And get me some clothes. A full outfit.
I can't go around in this uniform.

823
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:14,384
As long as I don't get
mixed up in it myself.

824
01:09:14,385 --> 01:09:16,511
You won't. I just want
you to get some things,

825
01:09:16,512 --> 01:09:18,638
and put an advertisement
in the newspaper for me.

826
01:09:18,639 --> 01:09:22,091
I really oughtn't to,
if I had any sense.

827
01:09:22,100 --> 01:09:26,645
I know I shall have awful gas pains
in the morning as a result of this.

828
01:09:26,646 --> 01:09:28,187
Just say...

829
01:09:28,188 --> 01:09:31,724
"Catherine, where are you?

830
01:09:32,526 --> 01:09:34,902
"I am free at last.

831
01:09:34,903 --> 01:09:38,480
"Meet me at the Palace
Hotel, Stresa."

832
01:09:39,197 --> 01:09:41,524
Signed "Frederic."

833
01:10:11,393 --> 01:10:14,436
The Major made an obituary speech
in your memory and the Priest,

834
01:10:14,437 --> 01:10:17,397
- he wanted to say mass for your soul.
- But what...

835
01:10:17,398 --> 01:10:19,899
Vermouth. One for you?
Uh, two vermouth.

836
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:22,568
You see, we all thought
you were dead.

837
01:10:22,569 --> 01:10:25,279
It never occurred to us that you
might have be shell-shocked,

838
01:10:25,280 --> 01:10:27,406
wandered away, lost your memory.

839
01:10:27,407 --> 01:10:29,407
How did you find me?

840
01:10:29,408 --> 01:10:32,777
I saw your advertisement
in the paper.

841
01:10:32,786 --> 01:10:34,954
But as soon as we knew,
we arranged everything.

842
01:10:34,955 --> 01:10:37,915
Rinaldi will work on you one
of his miraculous cures.

843
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:39,624
You will go back a hero.

844
01:10:39,625 --> 01:10:40,917
I'm not going back.

845
01:10:40,918 --> 01:10:44,545
They will decorate you for bravery.
They will even promote you.

846
01:10:44,546 --> 01:10:46,289
No.

847
01:10:46,381 --> 01:10:48,966
I'm through with the war.
Get that straight.

848
01:10:48,967 --> 01:10:50,593
But you cannot do that!

849
01:10:50,594 --> 01:10:52,469
You cannot just stop and say,
"I'm through with the war."

850
01:10:52,470 --> 01:10:54,596
- They will not let you do that.
- Two vermouth.

851
01:10:54,597 --> 01:10:56,339
Hmm.

852
01:11:02,479 --> 01:11:04,438
Can I speak to you a moment, sir?

853
01:11:04,439 --> 01:11:07,107
- It's all right, Harry, he's my friend.
- But I, uh...

854
01:11:07,108 --> 01:11:11,111
He keeps telling me that it's dangerous
for me to stay here any longer.

855
01:11:11,112 --> 01:11:15,447
The policeman was in tonight.
He spoke of notifying the carabinieri.

856
01:11:15,448 --> 01:11:19,826
- When will they come?
- Tonight, tomorrow, who knows? But soon.

857
01:11:19,827 --> 01:11:22,862
My boat is still ready, sir.

858
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,949
Thank you, Harry.

859
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:29,292
If they arrest you,
no one can save you.

860
01:11:29,293 --> 01:11:31,294
- I know that.
- They will shoot you.

861
01:11:31,295 --> 01:11:32,629
Look...

862
01:11:32,630 --> 01:11:36,458
Get this through your head,
I'm not going back!

863
01:11:36,467 --> 01:11:40,336
I've got to wait here until
I can find Catherine.

864
01:11:40,845 --> 01:11:43,722
And how do you expect to do that?

865
01:11:43,723 --> 01:11:45,932
I've got some people looking for her.

866
01:11:46,433 --> 01:11:51,011
- If that is more important than...
- She's going to have a baby.

867
01:11:51,313 --> 01:11:53,263
My baby.

868
01:11:56,234 --> 01:11:58,017
So...

869
01:11:58,319 --> 01:12:01,479
And that means everything to you.

870
01:12:02,156 --> 01:12:04,198
Yes, it would.

871
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:08,694
It means that I've got to find
her and get her out of Italy.

872
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:13,198
- Perhaps she's no longer in Italy.
- What makes you say that?

873
01:12:13,291 --> 01:12:15,292
She is in Switzerland.

874
01:12:15,293 --> 01:12:16,959
Where?

875
01:12:16,960 --> 01:12:19,495
- Brissago.
- Brissago?

876
01:12:20,213 --> 01:12:22,122
Harry!

877
01:12:44,859 --> 01:12:46,694
Will you do one for me, too?

878
01:12:46,695 --> 01:12:49,687
Yes, madam. Step around here.

879
01:12:51,699 --> 01:12:53,200
No.

880
01:12:53,201 --> 01:12:55,777
Just the head, please.

881
01:13:29,732 --> 01:13:31,358
Isn't there any mail for me, yet?

882
01:13:31,359 --> 01:13:32,984
Ah, madam!

883
01:13:32,985 --> 01:13:35,444
Yes, yes. Today there are letters.

884
01:13:35,445 --> 01:13:38,072
- Many letters.
- Many? Oh!

885
01:13:38,073 --> 01:13:39,281
- Twenty, madam.
- Twenty!

886
01:13:39,282 --> 01:13:42,568
Well, that was worth waiting for...

887
01:13:45,287 --> 01:13:47,113
Oh...

888
01:14:19,108 --> 01:14:21,442
It is up the lake and across.

889
01:14:21,443 --> 01:14:23,945
- About 35 kilometres.
- I'll make it.

890
01:14:23,946 --> 01:14:25,738
At the frontier,
there will be sentries.

891
01:14:25,739 --> 01:14:27,532
- I know.
- And you will have to watch out

892
01:14:27,533 --> 01:14:28,991
- for patrol boats.
- I will.

893
01:14:28,992 --> 01:14:32,652
- If it blows too hard, you...
- I won't drown.

894
01:14:34,289 --> 01:14:37,156
Have you enough money? Here.

895
01:14:38,959 --> 01:14:40,418
Won't you need it?

896
01:14:40,419 --> 01:14:43,170
There must be a Villa
Rossa in Pordenone.

897
01:14:43,171 --> 01:14:45,964
Always the same girls until
they become like old friends.

898
01:14:45,965 --> 01:14:49,634
Like war comrades.
Take it, baby, please. Please.

899
01:14:49,635 --> 01:14:51,428
You're a good egg, Rinin.

900
01:14:51,429 --> 01:14:56,007
No, I am not a good egg. I am a fool.

901
01:14:56,308 --> 01:15:00,218
But if I had understood
how you felt about her...

902
01:15:00,728 --> 01:15:03,096
Good luck, baby.

903
01:15:17,910 --> 01:15:20,027
Ciao, baby.

904
01:15:27,251 --> 01:15:31,495
- Shall I get a new cylinder, Doctor?
- It is a new cylinder.

905
01:15:32,464 --> 01:15:36,875
Oh, I wanted so to have this
baby and not make any trouble.

906
01:15:37,176 --> 01:15:40,045
And now I'm all done.

907
01:15:40,888 --> 01:15:43,464
All gone to pieces.

908
01:16:04,242 --> 01:16:06,284
She is losing strength fast, Doctor.

909
01:16:06,285 --> 01:16:09,236
There's no use. I'll have to operate.

910
01:16:11,289 --> 01:16:13,740
That was lovely...

911
01:16:15,418 --> 01:16:19,079
Frederic, darling.

912
01:16:23,217 --> 01:16:26,085
You mustn't worry, darling.

913
01:16:26,552 --> 01:16:29,338
I'm not going to die now.

914
01:16:30,973 --> 01:16:35,468
I got past the place
where I was going to die.

915
01:16:37,979 --> 01:16:39,980
Aren't you glad?

916
01:16:39,981 --> 01:16:41,649
Of course you are not going to die.

917
01:16:41,650 --> 01:16:44,476
You mustn't think about it.

918
01:17:03,251 --> 01:17:07,037
- It's a caesarean.
- We're lucky to be on time.

919
01:17:26,104 --> 01:17:27,439
Is she going to be all right?

920
01:17:27,440 --> 01:17:29,023
- Are you the husband?
- Yes.

921
01:17:29,024 --> 01:17:30,274
She kept calling for you all night.

922
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:32,109
It would have been better
if you'd been here.

923
01:17:32,110 --> 01:17:34,403
I'm sorry. Is she in danger?

924
01:17:34,404 --> 01:17:36,947
- She's very weak.
- You don't suppose I could see her now?

925
01:17:36,948 --> 01:17:40,024
- Later, later.
- It won't be long.

926
01:18:19,610 --> 01:18:21,519
She can't die.

927
01:18:23,697 --> 01:18:25,897
Did you call?

928
01:18:28,993 --> 01:18:32,278
No, I didn't say anything.

929
01:18:52,514 --> 01:18:54,214
Not yet.

930
01:18:56,308 --> 01:18:58,476
- Is she all right?
- I hope so.

931
01:18:58,477 --> 01:18:59,519
The baby?

932
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,312
A boy, but he was dead before
she ever came in here.

933
01:19:02,313 --> 01:19:04,648
Oh... But she'll be all right?

934
01:19:04,649 --> 01:19:07,809
That's not in my hands any longer.

935
01:19:09,528 --> 01:19:12,863
Better go across the street and
get yourself some breakfast.

936
01:19:12,864 --> 01:19:14,657
You look as if you need it.

937
01:19:14,658 --> 01:19:18,235
It will be some time
before she can see you.

938
01:19:36,718 --> 01:19:39,587
There's nothing there, dog.

939
01:20:09,706 --> 01:20:12,498
You've had children?
What was it like?

940
01:20:12,499 --> 01:20:15,285
I beg your pardon? What did you say?

941
01:20:17,087 --> 01:20:21,748
Nothing. Some coffee,
please, and a brioche.

942
01:20:31,433 --> 01:20:33,934
It's in the papers. Italy has won!

943
01:20:33,935 --> 01:20:35,477
Thank God it's over.

944
01:20:35,478 --> 01:20:37,770
This is the beginning of the end.

945
01:20:37,771 --> 01:20:41,107
But it will be a long time
before they can rebuild

946
01:20:41,108 --> 01:20:42,900
what's been destroyed.

947
01:20:42,901 --> 01:20:46,112
"In the early morning
hours of November 4th,

948
01:20:46,113 --> 01:20:50,574
"the Austro-Hungarian supreme
command accepted by radiogram

949
01:20:50,575 --> 01:20:55,110
"the armistice conditions laid
down by the General Badoglio."

950
01:20:56,204 --> 01:20:58,614
Don't let her die.

951
01:20:59,290 --> 01:21:02,576
Oh, God, please don't let her die.

952
01:21:03,294 --> 01:21:06,963
I'll do anything for you
if you don't let her die.

953
01:21:06,964 --> 01:21:09,007
You took the baby...

954
01:21:09,008 --> 01:21:12,668
That was all right.
But don't let her die.

955
01:21:12,969 --> 01:21:14,469
Please.

956
01:21:14,470 --> 01:21:19,299
Please, dear God, don't let her die.

957
01:21:45,665 --> 01:21:48,366
Her husband's out there.

958
01:21:48,833 --> 01:21:51,159
Might as well let him in.

959
01:21:54,839 --> 01:21:57,332
I knew he was coming.

960
01:21:57,883 --> 01:22:01,252
When I went under,
I knew he was here.

961
01:22:04,722 --> 01:22:07,265
You won't tell him, will you?

962
01:22:07,266 --> 01:22:09,810
Tell him what?

963
01:22:09,811 --> 01:22:12,220
That I'm going to die.

964
01:22:14,481 --> 01:22:18,392
- No, we won't tell him.
- Thank you.

965
01:22:20,778 --> 01:22:22,771
Doctor...

966
01:22:23,948 --> 01:22:26,065
Have I long?

967
01:22:33,372 --> 01:22:35,457
Don't you see?

968
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:37,575
I have to know.

969
01:22:38,293 --> 01:22:40,286
Not long.

970
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:48,584
Let him come in.

971
01:22:49,220 --> 01:22:51,212
No, wait.

972
01:22:52,138 --> 01:22:54,056
Could I...

973
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:56,884
Could I have my bag, first?

974
01:23:06,235 --> 01:23:09,019
Oh! Such a mess.

975
01:23:13,907 --> 01:23:16,859
He never liked me to be pale.

976
01:23:26,753 --> 01:23:29,120
You can go in now.

977
01:23:43,100 --> 01:23:45,801
- Catherine.
- Darling.

978
01:23:52,983 --> 01:23:55,893
- You're all right?
- I'm fine.

979
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:58,729
Did you worry about me?

980
01:23:59,197 --> 01:24:02,283
I came as soon as I
found where you were.

981
01:24:02,284 --> 01:24:04,034
Poor darling.

982
01:24:04,035 --> 01:24:06,486
Let me look at you.

983
01:24:06,871 --> 01:24:08,371
Ah...

984
01:24:08,372 --> 01:24:11,491
Tut-tut. You're wet and tired.

985
01:24:11,833 --> 01:24:14,659
Sit down, darling. Here...

986
01:24:21,550 --> 01:24:25,043
You're going to be
all right, Catherine.

987
01:24:31,100 --> 01:24:33,976
Do you want me to do anything, Cat?

988
01:24:33,977 --> 01:24:36,846
- Can I get you anything?
- No.

989
01:24:37,480 --> 01:24:39,806
Just talk to me.

990
01:24:40,066 --> 01:24:42,651
Tell me you haven't
stopped loving me.

991
01:24:42,652 --> 01:24:45,395
You know I couldn't stop.

992
01:24:45,947 --> 01:24:48,323
I like to hear you say it, though.

993
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:50,575
I'll never stop loving you.

994
01:24:50,576 --> 01:24:52,484
Never?

995
01:24:52,744 --> 01:24:54,578
Not even

996
01:24:54,579 --> 01:24:56,780
if I died?

997
01:24:58,458 --> 01:25:00,366
Never.

998
01:25:03,628 --> 01:25:06,338
You'd never do our things
with any other girl,

999
01:25:06,339 --> 01:25:09,132
or say the same things, would you?

1000
01:25:09,133 --> 01:25:10,758
Never.

1001
01:25:10,759 --> 01:25:14,095
I want you to have
other girls, though.

1002
01:25:14,096 --> 01:25:16,388
I don't want them.

1003
01:25:16,389 --> 01:25:18,882
That's right, dear.

1004
01:25:24,021 --> 01:25:25,480
Try...

1005
01:25:25,481 --> 01:25:27,640
Try to sleep, Cat.

1006
01:25:32,528 --> 01:25:36,147
When I get well, we'll...

1007
01:25:36,574 --> 01:25:40,159
We'll take a little house
in the mountains.

1008
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:43,987
We always planned a house
of our own, remember?

1009
01:25:44,080 --> 01:25:46,865
I'll get you a fine house.

1010
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:50,785
We'll live in it until
the war is over.

1011
01:25:51,670 --> 01:25:56,165
Then you'll go back to America
and be a splendid architect.

1012
01:25:57,217 --> 01:26:00,919
We'll be married all
over again. In a church.

1013
01:26:01,345 --> 01:26:03,421
In a church.

1014
01:26:05,682 --> 01:26:07,642
Oh, darling!

1015
01:26:07,643 --> 01:26:10,060
I don't wanna die.

1016
01:26:10,061 --> 01:26:12,104
- Don't let me die.
- Cat!

1017
01:26:12,105 --> 01:26:15,565
Take me in your arms, hold me tight.

1018
01:26:15,566 --> 01:26:18,067
- Don't let me go.
- Catherine.

1019
01:26:18,068 --> 01:26:20,403
It's dark out there, and lonely.

1020
01:26:20,404 --> 01:26:24,732
I don't wanna leave you any more.
I've been alone so much.

1021
01:26:26,367 --> 01:26:30,445
You... You can't die.
You're too brave to die.

1022
01:26:35,542 --> 01:26:38,827
You're a fine girl. A brave girl.

1023
01:26:39,336 --> 01:26:43,423
Yes. I am a brave girl.

1024
01:26:43,424 --> 01:26:46,626
Whatever happens, do not be afraid.

1025
01:26:46,802 --> 01:26:49,094
I'll not be afraid.

1026
01:26:49,095 --> 01:26:53,382
We've never been apart.
Really. Not since we met.

1027
01:26:53,808 --> 01:26:55,767
Not since we met.

1028
01:26:55,768 --> 01:26:57,936
And never can be.

1029
01:26:57,937 --> 01:27:01,639
- Never parted.
- In life and in death.

1030
01:27:01,856 --> 01:27:03,941
Say it, Cat.

1031
01:27:03,942 --> 01:27:06,643
In life and in death,

1032
01:27:07,445 --> 01:27:10,146

01:28:09,290 --> 01:28:12,366
Peace...

1037
01:28:12,968 --> 01:28:15,670
Peace...
