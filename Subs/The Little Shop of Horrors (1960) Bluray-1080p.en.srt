<i>My name is Sergeant Joe Fink...</i>

3
00:00:22,766 --> 00:00:25,135
<i>working a 24 hour shift on a homicide.</i>

4
00:00:25,641 --> 00:00:26,774
<i>And this is my workshop.</i>

5
00:00:27,345 --> 00:00:30,376
<i>The part of town that everybody knows about
but that nobody wants to see.</i>

6
00:00:30,891 --> 00:00:33,220
<i>Where the tragedies is a deeper,
the ecstasies wilder...</i>

7
00:00:33,245 --> 00:00:35,829
<i>and the crime rate
consistently higher than anywhere else</i>

<i>Skid Row</i>

00:00:37,673 --> 00:00:38,673
<i>My beat.</i>

10
00:01:51,858 --> 00:01:54,240
<i>The most terrifying period
in the history of my beat...</i>

11
00:01:54,265 --> 00:01:57,374
<i>began in a little rundown floral shop
called Mushnick's.</i>

12
00:02:02,265 --> 00:02:04,921
Ah, good morning Mrs. Shiva,
how's things today?

13
00:02:04,946 --> 00:02:07,554
The same as usual, Mr. Mushnick.

14
00:02:07,751 --> 00:02:10,008
My sister's nephew Stanley died.

15
00:02:10,033 --> 00:02:11,407
In Little Rock, Arkansas.

16
00:02:11,432 --> 00:02:12,876
Aww. What happened?

17
00:02:13,078 --> 00:02:15,006
He got blown up
who knows how.

18
00:02:15,031 --> 00:02:15,883
That's nice.

19
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,296
Well, you would like, maybe,
as usual some flowers for the funural?

20
00:02:19,366 --> 00:02:21,702
<i>♪ Should auld acquaintance be forgot,</i>

21
00:02:21,727 --> 00:02:23,882
<i>♪ ... and never brought to mind?</i>

22
00:02:23,907 --> 00:02:25,438
I thought, possibly,

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:28,539
because I always give you
all my funeral business...

24
00:02:28,571 --> 00:02:31,297
and maybe you should possibly give to me, eh...

25
00:02:31,516 --> 00:02:32,696
a little cut today.

26
00:02:32,758 --> 00:02:34,589
Look on me, Mrs. Shiva.

27
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,321
What am I?
A philatelist?

28
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:39,250
I sell on Skid Row
nothing but cheap carnations.

29
00:02:39,804 --> 00:02:41,335
And I should give you a cut rate.

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,827
I can't even afford water for the flowers!

31
00:02:43,944 --> 00:02:45,921
To my throat I would be giving a cut.

32
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:50,421
<i>♪ I dreamt I dwelt in Marble Halls</i>

33
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:53,304
<i>- ♪ With vassals and...</i>
- Shut up from the back!

34
00:02:55,507 --> 00:02:57,038
Excuse me, Mrs. Shiva.

35
00:02:57,070 --> 00:02:59,812
- That Seymour...
- He's a nice boy.

36
00:02:59,893 --> 00:03:02,135
- Why don't you let him sing?
- What sing?

37
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:04,127
Look: Here I got a new customer.

38
00:03:04,152 --> 00:03:05,471
Brand new in the yellow vest.

39
00:03:05,496 --> 00:03:06,589
I should let the clean up boy...

40
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:09,778
but I can't even afford
chase them out right away.

41
00:03:14,065 --> 00:03:16,807
Flowers fresh as the spring time.
Mushnick. Hello?

42
00:03:16,917 --> 00:03:18,292
Oh, hello Dr. Farb.

43
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:19,573
<i>What can I do for you today?</i>

44
00:03:19,775 --> 00:03:21,596
Listen, Mushink, I haven't got much time.

45
00:03:21,627 --> 00:03:24,111
Send me over two gladiolas and a fern.

46
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:27,173
Excellent, that's two dozen glads,
one pottet fern.

47
00:03:27,291 --> 00:03:29,244
No, no, no, Mushnick!

48
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:31,480
Two gladiolas and one fern.

49
00:03:33,784 --> 00:03:36,401
You want I should put
two gladiolas in the pot with the fern.

50
00:03:36,682 --> 00:03:38,659
No, one fern, one piece.

51
00:03:38,684 --> 00:03:40,714
Altogether three pieces.

52
00:03:40,744 --> 00:03:42,134
I need it for my waiting room.

53
00:03:43,072 --> 00:03:44,611
- A filling fell out.
- What?

54
00:03:44,636 --> 00:03:47,346
- A filling fell out.
- Good, I'll drill a bigger hole.

55
00:03:47,782 --> 00:03:50,415
You mean you want two crummy gladiolas
and one crummy fern?

56
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,275
What kind of a decoration is that?

57
00:03:52,353 --> 00:03:54,485
This is my flower budget for the week.

58
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:56,132
Mushnick.

59
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,336
Who can be a dentist on Skid Row?

60
00:03:58,382 --> 00:04:00,804
Fine, excellent.
I'll send Seymour right away.

61
00:04:01,015 --> 00:04:02,780
<i>Who am I to argue with science?</i>

62
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:04,561
Make it snappy.

63
00:04:05,452 --> 00:04:07,273
Now you are going to get ...

64
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:10,359
oh, you are going to get it.

65
00:04:10,624 --> 00:04:11,859
Look.

66
00:04:15,038 --> 00:04:16,538
Seymour Krelborn!

67
00:04:17,155 --> 00:04:19,968
Now, Mrs. Shiva.
We were talking from the funeral flowers.

68
00:04:20,014 --> 00:04:20,881
But the little...

69
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:25,865
Did you call me, Mr. Mushnick?

70
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:31,068
No. I was calling John D. Rockefeller
for to make a loan on my Rolls Royce.

71
00:04:31,131 --> 00:04:32,334
Sorry I said it.

72
00:04:32,436 --> 00:04:33,749
Now look Seymour.

73
00:04:35,185 --> 00:04:36,990
You take two gladiolas.

74
00:04:37,068 --> 00:04:38,678
You'll cut them nice and even.

75
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,240
You'll take one fern.
You'll wrap them in a package...

76
00:04:41,265 --> 00:04:43,208
and you'll take them to Dr. Farb.

77
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,250
Right?

78
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:46,521
Now go already!

79
00:04:47,518 --> 00:04:48,987
Now what can I do for you, sir?

80
00:04:49,058 --> 00:04:50,354
Uh, my name is Burson Fouch.

81
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:52,245
Excellent! I am Gravis Mushnick.

82
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:53,104
Oh, that's a good one.

83
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,956
Who is gonna get my roses?

84
00:04:54,981 --> 00:04:56,572
I'll take care of you, Mrs. Shiva.

85
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:57,698
Come right over here.

86
00:04:58,509 --> 00:05:01,759
You would like, maybe, some orchids
for a nice girl?

87
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,822
No, I think I'd like
a couple of dozen carnations.

88
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,057
Carnations.

89
00:05:05,674 --> 00:05:09,002
A person find a lot of these these
that somebody shouldn't drop dead!

90
00:05:09,243 --> 00:05:11,945
You had more than
your share of bad luck, Mrs. Shiva.

91
00:05:12,046 --> 00:05:13,406
Bad luck, she calls it.

92
00:05:13,492 --> 00:05:15,555
You should have so many people kicked off.

93
00:05:17,492 --> 00:05:19,254
About the carnations...

94
00:05:19,624 --> 00:05:20,960
You said you wanted some roses.

95
00:05:20,984 --> 00:05:22,875
Yeah. For Stanley.

96
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,453
My carnations.

97
00:05:30,445 --> 00:05:32,478
You should see wha—
See, Morris.

98
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:34,088
Oh, here are your carnations.

99
00:05:34,284 --> 00:05:37,104
- Wait, I'll wrap them for you.
- No, it's all right. I'll eat them here.

100
00:05:42,135 --> 00:05:42,924
Why not?

101
00:05:46,127 --> 00:05:47,564
Of course. What else?

102
00:05:48,754 --> 00:05:49,754
They are alright?

103
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:50,690
Well, I've had better.

104
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,566
Well, this is a small shop.

105
00:05:52,591 --> 00:05:53,589
That's ok.

106
00:05:53,784 --> 00:05:54,808
You know: These big places...

107
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,909
they are full of pretty flowers,
expensive flowers.

108
00:05:57,073 --> 00:05:59,948
When you raise them for looks and smell
you're bound to lose some food value.

109
00:06:00,096 --> 00:06:01,925
I like these little out-of-the-way places.

110
00:06:03,705 --> 00:06:05,323
Such a thing - eating flowers.

111
00:06:05,749 --> 00:06:07,459
Look: Don't knock it until you try it, huh?

112
00:06:09,491 --> 00:06:10,491
Look what happened.

113
00:06:12,678 --> 00:06:15,384
This is what I was trying
to tell you before

114
00:06:15,444 --> 00:06:16,858
Look on him, everybody!

115
00:06:16,991 --> 00:06:19,061
Look at the quality of his work!

116
00:06:19,184 --> 00:06:21,161
I ask you: When I fire him...

117
00:06:21,513 --> 00:06:23,498
where is he gonna get
such another good job?

118
00:06:23,888 --> 00:06:24,888
You mean I'm fired?

119
00:06:24,912 --> 00:06:27,911
No, I'm electing you
president from the United States.

120
00:06:28,390 --> 00:06:29,624
Yes, you are fired!

121
00:06:29,741 --> 00:06:32,178
- Gravis, you can't do that.
- Who? Who can't?

122
00:06:33,234 --> 00:06:35,179
- I didn't mean it.
- You didn't mean it.

123
00:06:35,241 --> 00:06:36,678
You never mean it.

124
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:40,405
You didn't mean it the time you put up
the bouquet with the get well card...

125
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,546
in the funeral parlour.

126
00:06:41,571 --> 00:06:43,319
And send the black lilies...

127
00:06:43,344 --> 00:06:45,969
to the old lady in the hospital,
you didn't mean it.

128
00:06:45,992 --> 00:06:47,117
But this time...

129
00:06:47,142 --> 00:06:50,079
I, Gravis Mushnick, mean it!

130
00:06:51,157 --> 00:06:52,157
He means it.

131
00:06:53,119 --> 00:06:56,494
But see, Mr. Mushnick,
don't I always try to do what's right?

132
00:06:56,571 --> 00:06:57,758
And I'm crazy about flowers.

133
00:06:57,783 --> 00:07:00,071
I like flowers almost as much
as Audrey does.

134
00:07:00,328 --> 00:07:01,945
Excellent.
You're fired.

135
00:07:01,999 --> 00:07:03,788
Why don't you give him a chance
to resurrect himself?

136
00:07:03,813 --> 00:07:05,499
I give him a chance to quit.

137
00:07:05,524 --> 00:07:07,936
- I ain't gonna quit.
- You're a brave boy. You're fired!

138
00:07:08,741 --> 00:07:10,640
But that ain't fair, Mr. Mushnick.

139
00:07:10,811 --> 00:07:11,896
You know what I'm doin'?

140
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:15,329
I'm working on a special surprise plant
just for you.

141
00:07:15,397 --> 00:07:17,295
I'm growing a plant
like you ain't never seen before.

142
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:19,967
Excellent! I can't even sell
the plants I got in my shop.

143
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:21,717
- Out, you!
- Now, wait a minute.

144
00:07:22,186 --> 00:07:23,905
If he's got a new kind of plant
you'll look at it.

145
00:07:24,006 --> 00:07:26,156
I don't look on flowers, Mr. Yellowvest.

146
00:07:26,336 --> 00:07:29,476
I got ancestors in the flower business
for 200 years.

147
00:07:29,501 --> 00:07:32,519
But I got one shop on Skid Row,
one stinking shop.

148
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:34,730
- I don't even like flowers!
- Now, you don't understand what I mean.

149
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:38,114
Look: I've been eating in flower shops
all over the world.

150
00:07:38,456 --> 00:07:41,674
And I have noticed that the places that have the mosts
weird and unusal plants were the best business.

151
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:42,378
See?

152
00:07:42,403 --> 00:07:43,629
- See?
- See?

153
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:45,488
What is this?
A tango?

154
00:07:46,347 --> 00:07:47,347
Alright.

155
00:07:48,081 --> 00:07:49,190
Explain me more.

156
00:07:49,698 --> 00:07:50,698
Well...

157
00:07:50,869 --> 00:07:53,526
I remember one place that had a whole wall
covered with poison ivy.

158
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:55,323
And people came from miles around
to look at the wall.

159
00:07:55,348 --> 00:07:56,409
And they stayed to buy.

160
00:07:56,474 --> 00:07:57,504
The owner got rich?

161
00:07:57,676 --> 00:08:00,285
No. He scratched himself to death
in an insane asylum.

162
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,244
Oh!

163
00:08:01,269 --> 00:08:02,939
That was my cousin Harry.

164
00:08:03,691 --> 00:08:04,691
Alright.

165
00:08:05,285 --> 00:08:06,285
Alright.

166
00:08:06,864 --> 00:08:10,129
You go home and you get this fancy
schmancy plant and you bring it back here.

167
00:08:10,154 --> 00:08:13,564
And if Mr. Yellowvest Fouch says
it's a draw, you still got a job.

168
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,139
If he don't - out you go to Bodeo, right?

169
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,874
Dont' worry.
You'll like it - you'll see.

170
00:08:36,578 --> 00:08:38,593
This is Radio KSIK

171
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:41,875
You've been listening to
"Music for Old Invalids".

172
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:43,961
Our next selection is entitled...

173
00:08:44,109 --> 00:08:45,312
"Sickroom Serenade"

174
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:48,445
Seymour, is that you?

175
00:08:48,617 --> 00:08:49,797
Yeah, ma.

176
00:08:50,156 --> 00:08:51,375
Get in here.
Look at my tongue

177
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,070
But ma, I've already seen your tongue.

178
00:08:56,437 --> 00:08:58,664
There be no sympathy for your poor mother?

179
00:08:58,718 --> 00:09:01,093
Laughing at her and mocking her illness...

180
00:09:01,118 --> 00:09:03,124
and she's got one foot in the grave.

181
00:09:03,304 --> 00:09:05,444
- I didn't mean it.
- Oh, you never mean it.

182
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,210
Oh, come on. Look at my tongue.

183
00:09:08,070 --> 00:09:10,547
That tongue is a tongue, ma.
They all look the same to me.

184
00:09:11,539 --> 00:09:14,844
Did you stop at Dr. Mallard and
get the results of my tests?

185
00:09:15,093 --> 00:09:16,890
Yeah, he said there's nothing wrong with you.

186
00:09:16,977 --> 00:09:18,406
Oh, not Dr. Mallard.

187
00:09:18,431 --> 00:09:21,012
He-He is one doctor
I thought would tell the truth.

188
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:23,164
He said you sould be playing
fullback for the Rams.

189
00:09:23,218 --> 00:09:24,640
He wants me dead.

190
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,171
I'll bet he is assistant coroner.

191
00:09:27,318 --> 00:09:29,474
Well, I gotta...
- A-A-And I know I got...

192
00:09:29,747 --> 00:09:33,528
My goiter's coming back.
I can feel it every morning after breakfast.

193
00:09:33,595 --> 00:09:34,931
Yeah, that's when you take those great...

194
00:09:37,494 --> 00:09:39,462
What you got?
A little surprise for me?

195
00:09:39,884 --> 00:09:41,485
- Open it up and see.
- Alright.

196
00:09:47,852 --> 00:09:50,657
Dr. Slurpsaddle's famous tonic.

197
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,643
Wait here.

198
00:09:54,487 --> 00:09:58,417
To be taken internally or
externally for pain and neuritis...

199
00:09:58,612 --> 00:10:01,182
neuralgia, headaches,

200
00:10:01,597 --> 00:10:04,284
I-if hit by a truck,
call your physician.

201
00:10:04,819 --> 00:10:08,339
Alcoholic content:
98 percent!

202
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,710
Oh, Seymour.

203
00:10:11,749 --> 00:10:14,749
You'll never know
what it is gonna do for me.

204
00:10:21,482 --> 00:10:26,372
Oh, I can feel that surge of
warm health going through me already.

205
00:10:27,281 --> 00:10:30,390
Look, ma. I gotta get my plant
and hurry back to the shop.

206
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,477
You mean that
lousy weed out in the kitchen?

207
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:35,242
Yeah. If Mr. Mushnick doesn't like it,
he's gonna fire me.

208
00:10:37,550 --> 00:10:40,550
Apparently, my hearing is goin' out on me.

209
00:10:41,113 --> 00:10:43,128
I just had the faint impression...

210
00:10:43,214 --> 00:10:47,378
that your job security depends on
what Muchnick thanks of that thing.

211
00:10:47,488 --> 00:10:50,206
It looks worse than it did this
morning when I went to work.

212
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,010
I wish I knew what to do with it.

213
00:10:52,292 --> 00:10:54,909
Well, if you ask me,
I'd pitch it out in the trash.

214
00:10:54,910 --> 00:10:57,519
I don't like my house cluttered up
with rotten vegetables.

215
00:10:57,544 --> 00:10:59,824
Look ma, I gotta hurry.
Can I bring you anything?

216
00:10:59,855 --> 00:11:02,964
Oh yeah, yeah.
Bring me the Evening News.

217
00:11:03,104 --> 00:11:05,986
They're running a-a
self-diagnosis contest.

218
00:11:06,011 --> 00:11:08,299
The winner gets to go to to Mayo Clinic.

219
00:11:08,324 --> 00:11:09,985
- Ha, ha.
- Bye, ma.

220
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,369
Bye, son.
I'll see you at the rosy edge of dawn!

221
00:11:13,931 --> 00:11:17,533
<i>♪ Drink to me only with thine eyes</i>

222
00:11:17,558 --> 00:11:19,213
<i>♪ And I will ...</i>

223
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:25,580
And put this on my bill.

224
00:11:28,589 --> 00:11:29,855
Here it is everybody.

225
00:11:30,402 --> 00:11:31,816
What do you think of it?

226
00:11:31,841 --> 00:11:33,011
Well...

227
00:11:33,315 --> 00:11:34,495
It sure is different.

228
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:36,681
It looks delicious but
don't you think it's kind of stale?

229
00:11:36,706 --> 00:11:38,539
I hasn't been feeling too well.

230
00:11:38,564 --> 00:11:39,894
You call that a fancy plant?

231
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:42,776
It looks like it never spent
an healthy day in its entire life.

232
00:11:42,893 --> 00:11:43,916
I don't care.

233
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:45,229
I like it anyway.

234
00:11:45,370 --> 00:11:47,362
You, you like even skunk cabbage.

235
00:11:47,387 --> 00:11:48,588
Yeah.

236
00:11:48,947 --> 00:11:50,774
What kind of a plant is this, Seymour?

237
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,205
Well, I'm not sure.

238
00:11:52,322 --> 00:11:55,310
I got the seeds from a Japanese gardener
over on Central Avenue.

239
00:11:55,564 --> 00:11:58,970
He found them in with an order he got
from a plantation next to a cranberry farm.

240
00:11:58,995 --> 00:11:59,955
Fine.

241
00:12:00,032 --> 00:12:02,618
Fine. You don't even know what
is this plant you're groing.

242
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,970
- Well, I gave it a name.
- What name?

243
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:09,235
What? You gave it a dirty name you can't even mention it?

244
00:12:09,572 --> 00:12:10,572
Well...

245
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:11,962
I named it Audrey Jr.

246
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:14,907
You named it after me?

247
00:12:14,932 --> 00:12:15,969
Oh, really?

248
00:12:16,227 --> 00:12:18,930
That's the most exiting thing
anyone's ever done to me.

249
00:12:18,992 --> 00:12:20,238
You poor kid.

250
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,716
I don't think it's so much...

251
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,285
I should keep on spending
ten dollars a week on your salary.

252
00:12:25,310 --> 00:12:26,161
But Gravis...

253
00:12:26,186 --> 00:12:27,612
he named it after me!

254
00:12:27,637 --> 00:12:29,994
I know and if they keep it
they'll name it Mushnick's Folly...

255
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:32,605
because I'll be in jail
because of non-payment of taxes.

256
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:34,035
- Are you crazy?
- Who? Who?

257
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,060
You. You.

258
00:12:35,096 --> 00:12:37,296
That's probably the only plant
of its kind in the world.

259
00:12:37,321 --> 00:12:39,432
Don't you realize if Seymour can
nurse that thing back to health...

260
00:12:39,457 --> 00:12:41,362
you have people
coming here from all over?

261
00:12:41,425 --> 00:12:43,526
- You think so, you Fouch?
- I know so, you Mushnick?

262
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,200
That's all I'm saying on the subject.

263
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:47,950
Sod, I got to get home.
My wife's making gardenias for dinner.

264
00:12:50,005 --> 00:12:51,544
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

265
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:52,700
I'll see you tomorrow.

266
00:12:53,567 --> 00:12:55,059
Crazy about kosher flowers.

267
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:57,770
He's a nice man.

268
00:12:58,372 --> 00:13:00,294
Maybe he knows what he's talking about.

269
00:13:00,676 --> 00:13:02,031
Maybe it's not so stupid.

270
00:13:03,036 --> 00:13:04,223
I'll tell you what I'll do.

271
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:07,105
I'll keep you
and this Dumbell Jr. For a week.

272
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:09,504
If you can nurse it back to health,
you both can stay.

273
00:13:09,529 --> 00:13:11,450
If you can't,
you're both fired.

274
00:13:11,475 --> 00:13:13,386
Aw, gee.
Thank you, Mr. Mushnick.

275
00:13:17,006 --> 00:13:19,299
Don't feel sad, Seymour.

276
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:22,675
Don't waste your pity on me Audrey,
I'm not worth it.

277
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:24,433
Who says you're not?

278
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:26,205
Everybody.

279
00:13:26,230 --> 00:13:27,480
Yeah, I know.

280
00:13:28,136 --> 00:13:31,136
But I think you're a fine
figurative of a man, and...

281
00:13:31,683 --> 00:13:36,222
and I know that Audrey Jr. Will be the
sweetest thing in the whole, wide world!

282
00:13:36,456 --> 00:13:37,808
Well, I don't know.

283
00:13:38,143 --> 00:13:42,409
I've given it every kind of fancy fertilizer
and atomic plant food and...

284
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:45,730
distilled mineral water that you can buy
but I just gets sicker and sicker.

285
00:13:46,114 --> 00:13:47,247
Don't worry.

286
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,153
You're gonna be another
Luther Glendale.

287
00:13:50,215 --> 00:13:51,215
Pasadena.

288
00:13:51,387 --> 00:13:52,387
Burbank.

289
00:13:53,496 --> 00:13:54,707
Good night, Seymour.

290
00:13:55,145 --> 00:13:56,519
G'night, Audrey.

291
00:14:05,615 --> 00:14:07,193
What's the matter little plant?

292
00:14:08,075 --> 00:14:10,591
Haven't I done everything
I could for you?

293
00:14:11,123 --> 00:14:12,583
Where did I goof?

294
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:18,982
You're the first little plant I ever tried to grow,
and if you die, I dunno what I'll do!

295
00:14:19,139 --> 00:14:20,514
Please don't die.

296
00:14:22,678 --> 00:14:24,405
I'll get you some water, ok?

297
00:14:42,427 --> 00:14:43,763
Oh, gee.

298
00:14:43,888 --> 00:14:47,385
You opened up just like you do
every night at sunset.

299
00:14:47,410 --> 00:14:49,567
I wish I knew how to make you grow.

300
00:14:50,615 --> 00:14:53,021
Here, let me move this out of your way
so you can breathe.

301
00:14:53,122 --> 00:14:55,364
Ow!
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

302
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:58,839
Hey, what happened?

303
00:14:58,896 --> 00:15:00,300
How come you woke up?

304
00:15:01,794 --> 00:15:02,794
Blood?

305
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:04,380
You like blood?

306
00:15:07,337 --> 00:15:08,634
You must be kidding.

307
00:15:09,618 --> 00:15:10,618
Well, we'll see.

308
00:15:19,606 --> 00:15:21,021
You know,
what I'm doing for you...

309
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:32,813
Aww, who could have thought it?

310
00:15:33,907 --> 00:15:34,907
Well...

311
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,789
I guess there's just no accounting
for people's taste.

312
00:15:49,173 --> 00:15:51,228
- Seymour!
- My boy.

313
00:15:51,253 --> 00:15:54,259
You're the most magnanimous
person in the whole world!

314
00:15:54,329 --> 00:15:56,064
Look on him, Audrey.
Isn't he beautiful?

315
00:15:56,142 --> 00:15:57,400
Isn't he delicious?

316
00:15:57,618 --> 00:15:59,391
Isn't he got a two dollar raise?

317
00:15:59,470 --> 00:16:00,806
What happened to your fingers?

318
00:16:00,831 --> 00:16:01,954
Bee stings.

319
00:16:02,024 --> 00:16:04,133
So how come
I'm all of a sudden so wonderful?

320
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,008
Five bees?
One for each finger?

321
00:16:06,071 --> 00:16:07,155
Ten bees.

322
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,946
Did you say I was getting a two dollar raise?

323
00:16:08,971 --> 00:16:10,860
Correct, my very excellent Seymour.

324
00:16:10,885 --> 00:16:12,976
- Indeed.
- What did I do now?

325
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,883
Don't you know what you did?

326
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,797
Oh, boy!
Look at that!

327
00:16:20,429 --> 00:16:21,429
It grew.

328
00:16:21,454 --> 00:16:23,163
It's almost a foot long.

329
00:16:23,289 --> 00:16:24,648
Isn't it empirical?

330
00:16:24,812 --> 00:16:27,351
It grows like a cold sore from the lips.

331
00:16:28,703 --> 00:16:32,125
Oh, hello young pretty ladies.
What can Gravis Mushnick do for you?

332
00:16:32,164 --> 00:16:34,335
Well, we saw your sign outside.
About the Audrey Jr.

333
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:36,309
So we thought we'd come in and take a look.

334
00:16:36,334 --> 00:16:37,334
Well, give a look.

335
00:16:37,359 --> 00:16:40,245
That makes four people today
who come in just to look at it.

336
00:16:40,278 --> 00:16:43,827
- Oh, dig Shirley.
- Is that just too much?

337
00:16:43,852 --> 00:16:45,328
Oh, what kind of plant is it?

338
00:16:45,353 --> 00:16:46,624
It's an Audrey Jr.

339
00:16:46,649 --> 00:16:48,614
How was it you got in trouble with ten bees?

340
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,759
Is that all?
I mean, doesn't it have a scientific name?

341
00:16:50,784 --> 00:16:51,954
Yes, of course.

342
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,118
But who could denounce it.

343
00:16:53,143 --> 00:16:55,119
You would like maybe to buy something.

344
00:16:55,144 --> 00:16:56,448
Well, we don't have any money...

345
00:16:56,473 --> 00:16:58,143
except 2000 dollars.

346
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:00,745
But that's just to spend on flowers.

347
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,156
So we don't have any of our own.

348
00:17:02,349 --> 00:17:03,349
Isn't that a drag?

349
00:17:03,374 --> 00:17:05,585
You got t-t-t-two thousand dollars...

350
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:07,639
just for to spend on flowers?

351
00:17:07,664 --> 00:17:08,927
- Mhm.
- That's right.

352
00:17:08,952 --> 00:17:10,796
Who died?
The Chamber of Commerce?

353
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:12,155
We're all from Cucamonga high school.

354
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:13,320
We're building a float.

355
00:17:13,351 --> 00:17:15,554
- For the Rose Bowl parade.
- Which is made of flowers.

356
00:17:15,579 --> 00:17:17,451
- Thousands of them.
- And we're on the comittee.

357
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:19,967
- That picks the florist.
- And then glues on the flowers.

358
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:25,045
- Gee, that sure is a mad plant.
- Wow, yeah.

359
00:17:25,164 --> 00:17:26,640
Seymour here invented it.

360
00:17:26,703 --> 00:17:29,156
- He didn't!
- Oh!

361
00:17:29,265 --> 00:17:31,164
Girls!
Girls, girls, girls!

362
00:17:31,210 --> 00:17:33,944
Please don't damage the horticulturalist.

363
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:38,795
Tell me, how come you don't buy all these
thousands of flowers from Gravis Mushnick?

364
00:17:39,108 --> 00:17:41,659
My flowers got something the others don't.

365
00:17:41,684 --> 00:17:43,092
- What's that?
- They're cheap.

366
00:17:43,117 --> 00:17:44,117
Well, cheap.

367
00:17:44,150 --> 00:17:46,385
If your shop is good enough
to develop the Audrey Jr...

368
00:17:46,485 --> 00:17:48,720
- I guess it can get everything we need.
- Yeah.

369
00:17:48,753 --> 00:17:50,455
We'll talk it over with the
rest of the committee.

370
00:17:50,494 --> 00:17:52,283
- Excellent.
- We've got to run now. Bye.

371
00:17:52,308 --> 00:17:54,032
- Bye!
- Bye!

372
00:17:54,213 --> 00:17:55,408
Bye, girls.

373
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:00,583
A son.

374
00:18:01,485 --> 00:18:02,485
A son.

375
00:18:02,510 --> 00:18:03,593
Look, Audrey!

376
00:18:03,819 --> 00:18:05,554
I got a son.

377
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:07,483
Oh, gee, Mr Mushnick.

378
00:18:07,508 --> 00:18:08,420
What, Mr. Mushnick?

379
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:10,859
I don't want you should
call me Mr. Mushnick anymore.

380
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:12,836
I want you should call me dad.

381
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:14,446
Ok, dad.

382
00:18:14,742 --> 00:18:16,249
Isn't that beautiful?

383
00:18:16,274 --> 00:18:17,797
Seymour Krelborn...

384
00:18:17,883 --> 00:18:19,585
come over here, my son.

385
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:22,133
I want to talk on you
about the future.

386
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,355
Look on this fly trap.

387
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,380
Look on it.

388
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,865
Soon we got no more Skid Row.

389
00:18:28,015 --> 00:18:30,218
We will be rich.
Us.

390
00:18:30,421 --> 00:18:32,046
I am building for you...

391
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:35,530
a giant greenhouse in which you are
making impossible flowers...

392
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:38,924
which in turn I am selling
at ridiculous prices...

393
00:18:38,949 --> 00:18:42,488
in my giant new flower saloon
in Beverly Hills.

394
00:18:43,495 --> 00:18:45,971
Do you see that big sign in the sky?

395
00:18:46,754 --> 00:18:47,910
It is saying...

396
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:50,620
"Gravis Mushnick", in French.

397
00:18:50,768 --> 00:18:52,120
Isn't it exciting?

398
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:55,565
And we'll have an orchestra
right by the cash register,

399
00:18:55,710 --> 00:18:57,562
and Gravis will wave his arms...

400
00:18:57,587 --> 00:19:00,632
and the orchestra will play
Mendelssohn's Spring Song.

401
00:19:01,194 --> 00:19:04,623
I'll come out in a gown,
wrapped by someone expensive and say:

402
00:19:04,835 --> 00:19:07,405
"The carnations are
600 dollars a dozen,"...

403
00:19:07,430 --> 00:19:08,670
"two dozen for a thousand."

404
00:19:08,695 --> 00:19:11,311
- It's a bargain!
- Get 'em while they last

405
00:19:11,336 --> 00:19:12,397
Stop shouting.

406
00:19:12,506 --> 00:19:18,900
My uncle Moishen's brother Yankel
just passed away in New Jersey.

407
00:19:19,186 --> 00:19:20,186
Tell me...

408
00:19:20,357 --> 00:19:22,271
how much are the carnations today?

409
00:19:22,296 --> 00:19:24,514
The carnations are 600 dollars a dozen.

410
00:19:24,539 --> 00:19:26,787
And why are they
letting him run around loose?

411
00:19:26,827 --> 00:19:29,318
Please.
Please excuse my son, Mrs. Shiva.

412
00:19:29,365 --> 00:19:31,710
Just point anything in the store
and it is yours.

413
00:19:31,735 --> 00:19:32,980
You mean anything?

414
00:19:33,005 --> 00:19:34,005
That's right.

415
00:19:34,030 --> 00:19:35,985
- The cash register, maybe, huh?
- Ah.

416
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:37,147
Wait a minute.

417
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:38,405
Here.

418
00:19:38,430 --> 00:19:41,475
Here are several dozen carnations...

419
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:45,842
on the house courtesey of
Gravis Mushnick, the bloom tycoon.

420
00:19:45,874 --> 00:19:47,958
- That's my dad.
- Thanks.

421
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:49,741
Thanks very much.

422
00:19:50,901 --> 00:19:52,018
Only, tell me...

423
00:19:52,402 --> 00:19:53,644
Why are you so happy?

424
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:58,034
Not only did my uncle Moishe's brother
Yankel die...

425
00:19:58,527 --> 00:20:00,152
in New Jersey...

426
00:20:01,665 --> 00:20:04,446
we should also give some flowers
to that poor dead plant there.

427
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:07,368
Good morning, Mr. Mushnick.

428
00:20:08,421 --> 00:20:09,421
Good morning.

429
00:20:10,001 --> 00:20:11,133
Good morning, Mrs. Shiva.

430
00:20:11,196 --> 00:20:13,212
Look what happened to my plant, dad.

431
00:20:13,237 --> 00:20:14,876
Who're you calling dad?
Who? Who?

432
00:20:14,901 --> 00:20:15,901
Oh no!

433
00:20:16,297 --> 00:20:19,125
- It was so beautiful just a few seconds ago.
- Excellent.

434
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:22,257
Just a few seconds ago I gave
away dozens of carnations.

435
00:20:22,282 --> 00:20:23,632
Free!
To Mrs. Shiva.

436
00:20:23,657 --> 00:20:24,664
I didn't mean it.

437
00:20:25,413 --> 00:20:27,843
You have perhaps an explanation.

438
00:20:28,054 --> 00:20:30,469
No, but if you give me a minute
I'll think of one.

439
00:20:30,494 --> 00:20:31,921
I can see it all now.

440
00:20:32,101 --> 00:20:33,781
We're in the poorhouse.

441
00:20:33,827 --> 00:20:37,209
The big sign in the sky
it is reading:

442
00:20:37,310 --> 00:20:40,584
"Seymour Krelborn.
Rest in Peace."

443
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:41,811
In Arabic!

444
00:20:41,850 --> 00:20:43,764
Oh, you've got to give him another chance.

445
00:20:43,999 --> 00:20:45,975
You promised me a week, Mr. Mushnick.

446
00:20:46,132 --> 00:20:47,764
I'd sit up all night with that plant.

447
00:20:47,789 --> 00:20:49,646
It'll be healthy in the morning,
you'll see.

448
00:20:49,749 --> 00:20:50,804
I promise.

449
00:20:51,201 --> 00:20:52,381
I promise.

450
00:21:01,657 --> 00:21:04,451
<i>Feed meeee.</i>

451
00:21:08,647 --> 00:21:11,670
<i>Feed meeee.</i>

452
00:21:12,867 --> 00:21:14,641
<i>Feed meeee!</i>

453
00:21:18,438 --> 00:21:19,531
Who said that?

454
00:21:19,688 --> 00:21:20,688
You said that.

455
00:21:20,805 --> 00:21:22,031
You said that!

456
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:24,811
Mhm.
Feed me!

457
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,593
You said that.

458
00:21:28,484 --> 00:21:29,679
You can talk.

459
00:21:30,117 --> 00:21:31,835
I got a talking plant.

460
00:21:32,539 --> 00:21:33,766
- Say it again.
- Feed me.

461
00:21:34,969 --> 00:21:36,094
Oh boy!

462
00:21:36,688 --> 00:21:39,016
I've never been to college and
I ain't been around much...

463
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,707
but I would be willing to bet there
ain't no such thing as a talking plant!

464
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,906
I'll take your word for it.

465
00:21:45,516 --> 00:21:47,570
Gee, Junior,
I'd-I'd like to feed you.

466
00:21:47,945 --> 00:21:49,516
But I've used up all my fingers.

467
00:21:49,891 --> 00:21:52,242
Feeeeeeed.

468
00:21:54,859 --> 00:21:57,055
Look at me,
I'm all cut to pieces.

469
00:21:57,302 --> 00:22:00,356
But maybe I can find
another drop here someplace.

470
00:22:06,747 --> 00:22:08,396
That's the best I can do.

471
00:22:08,678 --> 00:22:11,222
More!
More!

472
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:12,928
But I'm already anaemic.

473
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:16,380
Feed me more!

474
00:22:16,662 --> 00:22:17,662
See, Junior,

475
00:22:17,701 --> 00:22:19,795
I'd be happy to give you anything I got...

476
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:23,450
but I gotta keep a little blood for myself
or I'll be in worse shape than ma.

477
00:22:23,485 --> 00:22:24,703
Mmm.

478
00:22:25,414 --> 00:22:26,844
I'm sorry, Junior.

479
00:22:27,203 --> 00:22:29,562
I'll go for a walk.
Maybe I'll think of something.

480
00:25:12,978 --> 00:25:14,978
Feed me!

481
00:25:15,931 --> 00:25:17,915
Feed me!

482
00:25:18,009 --> 00:25:19,181
Look, chow-hound.

483
00:25:20,009 --> 00:25:22,111
Don't bother me.
I got problems of my own.

484
00:25:22,478 --> 00:25:23,689
Feed me!

485
00:25:24,149 --> 00:25:27,103
I am sorry, pal. I am fresh out of blood.
Talk to somebody else.

486
00:25:27,133 --> 00:25:28,867
I am hungry!

487
00:25:28,892 --> 00:25:30,477
I don't care what you are.

488
00:25:31,001 --> 00:25:32,384
Can't you see I am knocked out?

489
00:25:32,501 --> 00:25:33,774
I just killed a man.

490
00:25:34,352 --> 00:25:35,524
I'm a murderer.

491
00:25:36,078 --> 00:25:37,781
Think it's fun to be a murderer?

492
00:25:37,821 --> 00:25:38,993
You think it's fun to...

493
00:25:39,086 --> 00:25:40,508
haul around a sack full of...

494
00:25:40,570 --> 00:25:42,453
fooooood.

495
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,796
No, no, Junior!
What kind of guy do you think I am?

496
00:25:45,821 --> 00:25:47,812
I'm starved.

497
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:52,860
Maybe just a snack.

498
00:26:02,335 --> 00:26:03,593
That looks great.

499
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:17,644
What you call that salad?

500
00:26:17,669 --> 00:26:18,669
Nefarious.

501
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:21,267
Well, before the next course...

502
00:26:21,751 --> 00:26:23,405
I think I'll have a nice cigar.

503
00:26:23,430 --> 00:26:24,430
Alright?

504
00:26:24,962 --> 00:26:26,430
You would like maybe a cigar?

505
00:26:26,545 --> 00:26:27,959
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Ha-ha-ha.

506
00:26:27,984 --> 00:26:29,935
Ah, you don't smoke cigars, right.

507
00:26:30,099 --> 00:26:32,357
What am I thinking about?
Where are the matches?

508
00:26:33,436 --> 00:26:34,584
Oh, oi!

509
00:26:35,435 --> 00:26:36,482
You know what I found?

510
00:26:37,215 --> 00:26:38,676
I'm looking for the matches...

511
00:26:39,394 --> 00:26:41,479
And I found I left the
money in the red suit.

512
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:46,542
Here's your mock chicken leg.

513
00:26:46,722 --> 00:26:47,871
You don't have any money?

514
00:26:51,729 --> 00:26:53,409
So what else is new?

515
00:26:53,511 --> 00:26:55,019
Alright.
Alright!

516
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:56,175
I made a mistake.

517
00:26:56,300 --> 00:26:58,136
After all, a man is entitled.

518
00:26:58,721 --> 00:27:00,432
Go on. This is your story.

519
00:27:00,674 --> 00:27:02,073
I'll wait for the punch.

520
00:27:02,284 --> 00:27:04,604
Don't get smart with me, girlie.

521
00:27:04,728 --> 00:27:07,610
I'll have you know that in my shop
in the cash register...

522
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:10,229
I'm having the total day's receipts...

523
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,018
which is summing up
to more than nine dollars.

524
00:27:13,158 --> 00:27:14,837
You'll bring the rest of the food...

525
00:27:14,862 --> 00:27:17,181
and I'll go the the
shop and get the money!

526
00:27:17,735 --> 00:27:20,657
You are playing my favorite song.

527
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:22,649
Now, look here, buster.

528
00:27:22,883 --> 00:27:25,664
One of you is gonna go down
right now and get the loot...

529
00:27:25,689 --> 00:27:29,376
while the other one stays here
until the first one gets back.

530
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:31,517
If you get what I mean?

531
00:27:31,542 --> 00:27:32,571
Oh, fine.

532
00:27:32,596 --> 00:27:36,485
In this fancy schmancy restaurant
you are holding hostages, right?

533
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:37,510
Right.

534
00:27:38,845 --> 00:27:39,845
Excellent.

535
00:27:40,922 --> 00:27:42,449
You eat up, Audrey.

536
00:27:42,899 --> 00:27:45,438
I'll be back in a flash
with the cash.

537
00:27:45,463 --> 00:27:46,463
Bye, Gravis.

You're flush now, right?

548
00:28:36,374 --> 00:28:39,429
Bring me whiskey, rum, wine, gin, bourbon.

549
00:28:39,608 --> 00:28:43,897
- Why?
- Scotch, rye, tequila, sake, manishevitz

550
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,211
Did you bring the money?

551
00:28:45,236 --> 00:28:48,470
Don't mock me with the money.
I got to get drunk now.

552
00:28:48,541 --> 00:28:49,806
What's with him?

553
00:28:49,831 --> 00:28:50,831
- I don't know.
- Look.

554
00:28:51,064 --> 00:28:53,064
Here, take it.
Bring me anything.

555
00:28:53,103 --> 00:28:55,476
Bring everything. Creme de menthe.
Everything you've got!

556
00:28:55,501 --> 00:28:56,532
Ok!

557
00:28:57,892 --> 00:28:58,892
Gravis?

558
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:00,713
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

559
00:29:00,924 --> 00:29:02,322
You look like you've seen a ghost.

560
00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:04,611
Ghosts I could handle.
Don't ask.

561
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:06,374
Why don't you tell me?
Maybe I could help you.

562
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,860
Help, you couldn't.

563
00:29:08,446 --> 00:29:10,797
Try and eat something.
It'll calm your agrimation.

564
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,220
In mine own shop...

565
00:29:16,001 --> 00:29:17,517
Audrey, you wouldn't believe it.

566
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,468
I wish you'd break out and tell me.

567
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:20,617
Alright, I'll tell you.

568
00:29:20,642 --> 00:29:23,484
Tomorrow.
Right after I am telling the police.

569
00:29:26,421 --> 00:29:28,326
<i>But Mushnick didn't come to the police.</i>

570
00:29:29,125 --> 00:29:30,125
If he had...

571
00:29:30,304 --> 00:29:32,621
<i>that might have been the
finish of the unhappy story.</i>

572
00:29:33,125 --> 00:29:34,125
It was not.

573
00:29:51,568 --> 00:29:52,568
Hi, Gravis.

574
00:29:52,988 --> 00:29:56,466
85 dollars worth of business
already, and we've barely opened!

575
00:29:59,404 --> 00:30:00,404
What'd I tell you?

576
00:30:00,429 --> 00:30:03,380
You wouldn't be interested in selling
a half-interest to this place, huh?

577
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,724
- Mr. Mushnick.
- We talked to the comittee.

578
00:30:05,778 --> 00:30:08,206
- And they said we could use your flowers.
- On the float.

579
00:30:08,231 --> 00:30:10,824
- And guess what?
- We're going to feature Audrey Jr.

580
00:30:10,849 --> 00:30:13,324
- Right on top.
- Can't you just picture it?

581
00:30:13,349 --> 00:30:15,996
- I can picture it.
- Oh, won't the people just eat it up?

582
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:17,302
Eat up the people.

583
00:30:17,395 --> 00:30:19,263
And we're gonna have the big part of it open.

584
00:30:19,395 --> 00:30:20,724
- Of course she can fit in it.
- Who?

585
00:30:20,749 --> 00:30:22,982
- The queen.
- With her crown and scepter.

586
00:30:23,249 --> 00:30:24,584
She'll be so cute!

587
00:30:24,609 --> 00:30:27,202
- Oh, you could just eat her up.
- Eat up the girl.

588
00:30:27,249 --> 00:30:28,718
Oh, there's Seymour!

589
00:30:28,788 --> 00:30:30,538
Oh, Seymour!

590
00:30:30,563 --> 00:30:32,024
Ow, ow, ow, ow!
I got a toothache.

591
00:30:32,049 --> 00:30:33,900
Ow, I got a toothache.
Really, I...

592
00:30:34,642 --> 00:30:35,642
You...

593
00:30:35,681 --> 00:30:38,001
- Come with me.
- I got a toothache! It hurts!

594
00:30:38,026 --> 00:30:39,626
Ow, let go of my jaw.

595
00:30:41,072 --> 00:30:42,337
Ow, my jaw.
Ow, ow.

596
00:30:42,548 --> 00:30:43,814
Owwww.

597
00:30:43,908 --> 00:30:45,025
Now, Seymour.

598
00:30:45,218 --> 00:30:46,218
Talk on me!

599
00:30:46,243 --> 00:30:48,196
I got a toothache.
What do you wanna talk about?

600
00:30:48,221 --> 00:30:51,118
That plant.
Is that a nice subject for to talk?

601
00:30:51,376 --> 00:30:52,767
The plant is great,
it's...

602
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:54,313
it's it's four times
bigger than it was yesterday.

603
00:30:54,338 --> 00:30:57,407
I saw, I saw.
How come the plant is now so big?

604
00:30:57,837 --> 00:30:59,009
I don't know.

605
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:01,570
But look at them people out there.

606
00:31:01,703 --> 00:31:04,781
We only been open a half hour we already
done 70 dollars worth of business.

607
00:31:04,906 --> 00:31:06,742
85.
Now look, Seymour.

608
00:31:07,702 --> 00:31:10,325
You gave this plant a fancy name:
Audrey Jr.

609
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,204
But I want to know right now
what do just people call it?

610
00:31:13,521 --> 00:31:14,521
Well...

611
00:31:14,546 --> 00:31:16,827
well it's a cross between a butterworth
and a venus flytrap.

612
00:31:16,852 --> 00:31:18,443
Venus flytrap!

613
00:31:18,468 --> 00:31:20,960
And what are the habbits
of this Venus flytrap?

614
00:31:21,187 --> 00:31:22,975
Well, the book says it eats insects.

615
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:25,046
It eats them three times in it's life...

616
00:31:25,102 --> 00:31:26,992
- ... and then it's full grown.
- Excellent!

617
00:31:27,144 --> 00:31:29,640
And how many times is this one eat?

618
00:31:29,765 --> 00:31:30,765
Well...

619
00:31:31,227 --> 00:31:32,359
Once or twice.

620
00:31:32,678 --> 00:31:34,115
You don't remember?

621
00:31:34,552 --> 00:31:37,232
Well, this is kind of an
unusual type flytrap.

622
00:31:37,357 --> 00:31:39,459
That is a possibility.

623
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,910
It may never eat again.
I don't see how it could get any bigger.

624
00:31:43,505 --> 00:31:46,474
Then you think it don't
need any more flies?

625
00:31:47,255 --> 00:31:48,255
Yeah.

626
00:31:50,770 --> 00:31:52,864
Ow, my tooth is just killing me.

627
00:31:53,715 --> 00:31:54,715
Alright.
Excellent.

628
00:31:55,446 --> 00:31:57,157
You run along to the dentist.

629
00:31:57,547 --> 00:31:58,979
I'll take care of things here.

630
00:31:59,531 --> 00:32:00,531
Thanks, boss.

631
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:04,235
Gravis!
We got to order more flowers.

632
00:32:04,406 --> 00:32:05,695
Tons of them.

633
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,401
I'm making lots of money.

634
00:32:24,883 --> 00:32:27,086
<i>Argh!
Argh! Argh!</i>

635
00:32:27,797 --> 00:32:29,180
<i>Please don't hurt!</i>

636
00:32:29,305 --> 00:32:30,641
<i>Please don't hurt me!</i>

637
00:32:30,954 --> 00:32:32,625
<i>Argh!
Argh!</i>

638
00:32:36,594 --> 00:32:39,117
<i>That'll teach you to keep your
bill up to date, you deadbeat!</i>

639
00:32:39,172 --> 00:32:41,446
<i>Argh! Argh!
Argh!</i>

640
00:32:46,536 --> 00:32:47,856
Well, then run,
you snivelling dog!

641
00:32:48,254 --> 00:32:50,536
I'm glad, I hurt you.
I'm glad. I'm glad.

642
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:52,082
Seymour.

643
00:32:52,215 --> 00:32:54,012
Seymore.
Got a bad tooth, huh?

644
00:32:54,037 --> 00:32:55,535
No, I thought this
was the men's room!

645
00:32:55,567 --> 00:32:58,794
Seymour, come back here, you bad dog.
You get in there.

646
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,973
So, you are the young man
who ruined my gladiolas, huh?

647
00:33:03,998 --> 00:33:04,998
Sit down.

648
00:33:05,023 --> 00:33:06,380
Come on.

649
00:33:11,625 --> 00:33:12,625
Guess what?

650
00:33:12,642 --> 00:33:14,359
- My tooth stopped hurting.
- My tooth stopped hurting.

651
00:33:14,384 --> 00:33:15,430
Yes, I know.

652
00:33:15,563 --> 00:33:16,563
Let's see.

653
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:18,422
Shut up and open up.

654
00:33:18,719 --> 00:33:19,719
Uh-huh.

655
00:33:20,959 --> 00:33:21,959
Ah.

656
00:33:24,328 --> 00:33:25,859
- Argh!
- Does that hurt?

657
00:33:25,953 --> 00:33:28,328
- Yeah!
- Good. You haven't felt anything yet.

658
00:33:28,538 --> 00:33:30,928
- Ah-ha.
- It's this one over here.

659
00:33:31,093 --> 00:33:33,366
Seymour.
Who is the dentist here, you or me?

660
00:33:33,632 --> 00:33:34,999
I'll find that tooth.

661
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:36,070
M-hm.

662
00:33:36,147 --> 00:33:37,147
Ah-ha.

663
00:33:37,935 --> 00:33:40,810
Look at that stalagmite.

664
00:33:40,857 --> 00:33:43,560
But don't worry.
It's going to be an easy one, Seymour.

665
00:33:43,585 --> 00:33:45,007
I won't even use Novocaine.

666
00:33:45,211 --> 00:33:47,382
Ow, you poked the mirror in my mouth.

667
00:33:47,407 --> 00:33:49,390
Well, don't tell me about it, stupid.
Just swallow it.

668
00:33:50,741 --> 00:33:53,079
Alright.
Here's the thing now, Seymour.

669
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,108
I think I'll have this one
and this one...

670
00:33:56,319 --> 00:33:58,319
and that one and I
have to have this one, Seymour!

671
00:33:58,344 --> 00:33:59,593
It's only one tooth.

672
00:33:59,618 --> 00:34:00,703
Seymour, who is the dentist here,

673
00:34:00,728 --> 00:34:03,282
you or me? Are you practising
dentistry without a license?

674
00:34:04,321 --> 00:34:05,978
- Alright
- Uh-hu.

675
00:34:06,126 --> 00:34:07,267
Let's see.

676
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:10,720
Oh shit!
Seymour.

677
00:34:11,009 --> 00:34:14,212
<i>- ♪ Seymour, don't be...</i>
- Argh!

678
00:34:14,368 --> 00:34:16,111
Argh!

679
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,587
Look at that.

680
00:34:17,719 --> 00:34:19,618
Will you look at that, Seymour?

681
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:21,361
I didn't know you were an elk.

682
00:34:21,503 --> 00:34:22,503
Good.

683
00:34:23,003 --> 00:34:24,003
You know...

684
00:34:24,198 --> 00:34:26,205
I can't afford an assistant,

685
00:34:26,369 --> 00:34:29,322
so I get this ready instant mix.

686
00:34:29,713 --> 00:34:31,612
It doesn't last very long
but it tastes good.

687
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:32,909
Mmm.

688
00:34:33,791 --> 00:34:35,126
Alright, Seymour.

689
00:34:35,260 --> 00:34:36,549
Stay away from me!

690
00:34:36,587 --> 00:34:38,728
See? You're trying to kill me.

691
00:34:38,768 --> 00:34:40,768
A duel! Ah-ha!

692
00:34:54,055 --> 00:34:55,789
Is this doctor's office?

693
00:34:55,821 --> 00:34:57,125
Just a minute!

694
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,664
Aww, yes.

695
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,719
I see it is.

696
00:35:07,369 --> 00:35:09,486
I...
you-you can come in now.

697
00:35:17,377 --> 00:35:19,386
My name is Wilbur Force.

698
00:35:19,534 --> 00:35:20,979
Wilburforce what?

699
00:35:21,331 --> 00:35:22,331
Just...

700
00:35:22,892 --> 00:35:23,962
Wilbur Force.

701
00:35:23,986 --> 00:35:27,260
My first name is Wilbur,
my last name is Force.

702
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:29,689
I don't have a middle name.

703
00:35:29,791 --> 00:35:31,603
Well, you have an appointment, maybe?

704
00:35:31,992 --> 00:35:35,039
I don't have a middle name well you have
an appointment may be no but you were

705
00:35:35,352 --> 00:35:36,625
one of your patients.

706
00:35:36,658 --> 00:35:38,438
A Mrs. S. Shiva.

707
00:35:38,463 --> 00:35:41,243
I do a lot of undertaking
for her relatives.

708
00:35:42,329 --> 00:35:44,408
Well, as you could see,
I have a customer now...

709
00:35:44,907 --> 00:35:48,594
and I'm all booked up for the rest of the
day, so you have to come back tomorrow.

710
00:35:48,836 --> 00:35:50,453
Oh, I couldn't do that.

711
00:35:50,493 --> 00:35:52,477
I have three or four abscesses...

712
00:35:52,502 --> 00:35:53,889
a touch of pyorrhea...

713
00:35:53,914 --> 00:35:55,539
nine or ten cavities...

714
00:35:55,564 --> 00:35:58,515
I lost my pivot tooth
and I'm in terrible pain.

715
00:35:59,559 --> 00:36:01,324
Well, I-I can't help you today.

716
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,442
Oh, that's alright.

717
00:36:03,473 --> 00:36:05,489
I'll go just wait outside.

718
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:19,205
The patient came to me with a
large hole in his abdomen...

719
00:36:20,064 --> 00:36:23,196
caused by a fire poker
used on him by his wife.

720
00:36:24,423 --> 00:36:27,337
He almost bled to death
and gangrene had set in.

721
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,071
I didn't give me much of a chance.

722
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:32,110
There were other complications.

723
00:36:32,493 --> 00:36:37,079
The man had cancer,
tuberculosis, leprosy ...

724
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:39,048
and a touch of the grippe.

725
00:36:40,149 --> 00:36:41,938
I decided to operate.

726
00:36:42,024 --> 00:36:44,173
My... my patient just left.

727
00:36:44,228 --> 00:36:45,649
You cou... you could come in now.

728
00:36:46,156 --> 00:36:47,227
Oh goodie.

729
00:36:49,844 --> 00:36:52,493
- I didn't see the other man leave.
- Well...

730
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:54,195
he went out the back door

731
00:36:58,046 --> 00:37:00,827
You know, most people don't
like to go to the dentist...

732
00:37:00,859 --> 00:37:04,028
but I rather enjoy it myself, don't you?

733
00:37:04,061 --> 00:37:05,240
I mean there is such...

734
00:37:05,265 --> 00:37:07,474
there is a real feeling of growth,
of ...

735
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:08,849
of...

736
00:37:09,529 --> 00:37:11,170
progress when that...

737
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:13,045
that old drill goes in...

738
00:37:13,218 --> 00:37:17,209
and I'd almost rather go to the
dentist than anywhere, wouldn't you?

739
00:37:17,234 --> 00:37:18,234
Yeah.

740
00:37:19,179 --> 00:37:20,679
Now, no Novocaine.

741
00:37:20,704 --> 00:37:22,109
It dulls the senses.

742
00:37:23,430 --> 00:37:25,860
This is gonna hurt you more than it is me.

743
00:37:25,885 --> 00:37:27,899
Oh, goodie goodie, here it comes.

744
00:37:29,430 --> 00:37:30,532
Argh!

745
00:37:31,383 --> 00:37:32,578
Argh!

746
00:37:34,344 --> 00:37:35,289
Argh!

747
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:38,711
Oh my god,
don't stop now!

748
00:37:39,117 --> 00:37:40,429
Well, I made a lot of holes...

749
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:42,789
and now I've gotta fill it with this silver stuff.

750
00:37:42,859 --> 00:37:44,820
Well, aren't you gonna pull any?

751
00:37:45,195 --> 00:37:47,976
- Well, uh...
- Oh, come on.

752
00:37:49,195 --> 00:37:50,968
Well, it's your mouth.

753
00:37:59,348 --> 00:38:00,411
Argh!

754
00:38:01,598 --> 00:38:02,723
Argh!

755
00:38:04,239 --> 00:38:05,192
Argh!

756
00:38:08,559 --> 00:38:09,848
Well, Dr. Farb...

757
00:38:10,035 --> 00:38:11,989
it's been quite an afternoon.

758
00:38:12,178 --> 00:38:15,644
I can truly say
I've never enjoyed myself so much.

759
00:38:15,723 --> 00:38:18,429
I'll recommend you to all my friends.

760
00:38:18,430 --> 00:38:19,547
Thank you.
Bye.

761
00:38:19,572 --> 00:38:20,969
Bye, now.

762
00:38:29,669 --> 00:38:31,705
Feed me!

763
00:38:31,755 --> 00:38:33,059
Oh, take it easy, Dracula.

764
00:38:33,084 --> 00:38:35,364
What do you think I'm carrying here?
My dirty laundry?

765
00:38:40,475 --> 00:38:41,584
<i>Feed!</i>

766
00:38:41,716 --> 00:38:43,710
I'm coming!
I'm coming already.

767
00:38:49,019 --> 00:38:50,440
This should be enough for anybody.

768
00:38:50,465 --> 00:38:51,465
Mhm.

769
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:53,207
Fooood.

770
00:38:58,312 --> 00:39:00,218
Well, goodbye Dr. Farb.

771
00:39:00,788 --> 00:39:03,374
You may have been a crummy dentist
but you were a nice fellow.

772
00:39:04,005 --> 00:39:06,270
I never meant to kill
anybody in my whole life.

773
00:39:06,325 --> 00:39:08,720
Now I killed two in the last two days.

774
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:12,598
Well, he asked for it coming
at me with that knife and all.

775
00:39:13,958 --> 00:39:15,575
Bon voyage, Dr Farb.

776
00:39:16,340 --> 00:39:17,387
Want anything else?

777
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:19,394
[BURP]

778
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:20,691
[BURP]

779
00:39:21,441 --> 00:39:22,746
See you in the morning.

780
00:39:42,569 --> 00:39:43,569
Come in.

781
00:39:45,007 --> 00:39:46,007
It's me, Joe.

782
00:39:46,492 --> 00:39:47,492
Good morning, Frank.

783
00:39:48,437 --> 00:39:49,519
How's the wife, Frank?

784
00:39:49,601 --> 00:39:51,343
- Not bad, Joe.
- Glad to hear it.

785
00:39:51,593 --> 00:39:53,164
- The kids?
- Lost one yesterday.

786
00:39:53,360 --> 00:39:54,992
Awful, eh?
How did that happen?

787
00:39:55,165 --> 00:39:56,485
Playing with matches.

788
00:39:56,510 --> 00:39:57,688
Well, those are the breaks.

789
00:39:57,899 --> 00:39:58,899
Yeah, I guess so.

790
00:39:59,229 --> 00:40:00,315
Got a strange one here.

791
00:40:00,502 --> 00:40:03,088
Railroad people say the last one of their
best detectives the other night.

792
00:40:03,113 --> 00:40:04,033
Where?

793
00:40:04,058 --> 00:40:05,057
Down by the yards.

794
00:40:05,189 --> 00:40:06,712
He was watching refrigerator cars.

795
00:40:07,055 --> 00:40:08,259
Refrigerator cars?

796
00:40:08,798 --> 00:40:11,024
- Ice thieves.
- Oh yeah? What happened?

797
00:40:11,049 --> 00:40:12,049
Don't know.

798
00:40:12,048 --> 00:40:13,946
- Vanished, right on the tracks.
- Clues?

799
00:40:14,758 --> 00:40:15,758
None.

800
00:40:15,783 --> 00:40:16,783
Anything else?

801
00:40:16,931 --> 00:40:18,361
Dentist. Farb.

802
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,946
- Dead?
- Missing.

803
00:40:20,173 --> 00:40:21,282
Clues?

804
00:40:21,384 --> 00:40:22,782
- Blood in the office.
- Where?

805
00:40:22,829 --> 00:40:24,594
- Skid Row.
- Ideas?

806
00:40:25,321 --> 00:40:26,446
- None.
- Check it out?

807
00:40:27,438 --> 00:40:28,438
Yeah.

808
00:40:36,571 --> 00:40:38,032
<i>Now we were on the case,</i>

809
00:40:38,423 --> 00:40:40,001
<i>officer Frank Stoolie and me.</i>

810
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:41,876
<i>My name is Fink.</i>

811
00:40:42,767 --> 00:40:43,876
<i>Sergeant Joe Fink.</i>

812
00:40:44,923 --> 00:40:45,923
<i>I'm a fink.</i>

813
00:41:05,185 --> 00:41:06,489
Morning, Mr Mushnick.

814
00:41:07,357 --> 00:41:09,302
Oh, boy, look at that!

815
00:41:09,576 --> 00:41:10,880
Hi, everybody.

816
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,716
Oh, my god!

817
00:41:13,802 --> 00:41:15,661
- Ain't it something?
- It's...

818
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:17,974
It's monstrositous!

819
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:19,184
Yeah.

820
00:41:19,692 --> 00:41:22,036
And to think that you did it.

821
00:41:23,739 --> 00:41:25,715
Gee, Audrey. You don't have to kiss me.

822
00:41:26,231 --> 00:41:27,849
Don't you like me to kiss you?

823
00:41:28,434 --> 00:41:30,746
Yeah, but...
you don't like to kiss me.

824
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,278
Why shouldn't I?

825
00:41:32,668 --> 00:41:34,317
Nobody else ever did.

826
00:41:34,676 --> 00:41:35,981
Well, I do like to.

827
00:41:36,144 --> 00:41:38,424
You do? You really do?
You like to kiss me?

828
00:41:38,449 --> 00:41:39,356
Sure, I do.

829
00:41:39,381 --> 00:41:40,997
Would... would you like to kiss me again?

830
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:42,340
Ok.

831
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:43,777
That plant...

832
00:41:46,719 --> 00:41:49,524
Oh, boy! You kiss good, Audrey.

833
00:41:49,578 --> 00:41:51,945
Oh, I guess I just have a good kisser.

834
00:41:51,970 --> 00:41:53,812
H-h-h-how d-d-did...

835
00:41:53,837 --> 00:41:56,062
Would you like to go out on
a date with me some night?

836
00:41:56,203 --> 00:41:58,336
- When...?
- Oh, sure I would, Seymour.

837
00:41:58,361 --> 00:42:00,056
- Any time.
- Tonight?

838
00:42:00,374 --> 00:42:01,405
Ok.

839
00:42:01,789 --> 00:42:04,226
- Oh, boy!
- A-a-a-about that plant...

840
00:42:05,187 --> 00:42:06,625
- We got the list.
- Of flowers.

841
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,664
- For the float.
- For the rose parade.

842
00:42:08,711 --> 00:42:10,664
I can't talk to you now, girls.

843
00:42:10,914 --> 00:42:12,029
Talk on Audrey.

844
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:13,812
- We got the list.
- With the float.

845
00:42:13,837 --> 00:42:15,602
- It's ok. Let's take a look at it.
- Ok.

846
00:42:15,719 --> 00:42:16,743
Hi, what's cookin'?

847
00:42:16,829 --> 00:42:17,829
Look at my plant.

848
00:42:18,133 --> 00:42:20,390
- My, what a large one.
- Yeah.

849
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:28,014
Hello, Mrs. Shiva. What's new?

850
00:42:28,209 --> 00:42:30,225
Oy, I got terrible news.

851
00:42:30,889 --> 00:42:33,529
My nephew Frankie just lost his little boy.

852
00:42:33,631 --> 00:42:35,037
Oh, that's too bad.

853
00:42:35,062 --> 00:42:36,077
How did it happen?

854
00:42:36,102 --> 00:42:37,756
He was playing with matches.

855
00:42:37,907 --> 00:42:39,703
Would you like to buy, maybe, some flowers?

856
00:42:39,961 --> 00:42:42,117
Nah... about 50 cents worth.

857
00:42:42,235 --> 00:42:44,250
So I'll get the for you.
Look at my plant!

858
00:42:44,352 --> 00:42:45,758
I'm looking.

859
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:54,718
- Your name Gravis Mushnick?
- M-M-Mushnick, Gravis. That's my name.

860
00:42:54,882 --> 00:42:56,015
Just want to ask you a few questions.

861
00:42:56,040 --> 00:42:58,209
- Questions ask me why?
- Just want to ask a few questions.

862
00:42:58,234 --> 00:42:59,476
I-I didn't do it.

863
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:00,836
- Do what?
- Whatever.

864
00:43:00,929 --> 00:43:01,771
Ever see this man?

865
00:43:01,796 --> 00:43:03,171
Man... see... picture...

866
00:43:03,359 --> 00:43:04,358
Why are you so nervous?

867
00:43:04,383 --> 00:43:05,383
You got a guilty conscience?

868
00:43:05,428 --> 00:43:06,725
No! Why should I?

869
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:07,529
Ever see this man?

870
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:09,373
Man... see... this-this picture...

871
00:43:09,398 --> 00:43:10,647
Dr. Farb.

872
00:43:11,513 --> 00:43:13,083
- So you know him?
- He's my dentist.

873
00:43:13,145 --> 00:43:15,255
He... eh... maybe did something?

874
00:43:15,412 --> 00:43:16,974
- He disappeared.
- Blood in his office.

875
00:43:16,999 --> 00:43:17,896
Another man, too.

876
00:43:17,921 --> 00:43:19,661
Blood on the railroad tracks.

877
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:23,139
- Dr. Farb is murdered?
- Is he?

878
00:43:23,241 --> 00:43:25,280
Who knows? Not me!

879
00:43:26,225 --> 00:43:27,225
What do you think?

880
00:43:27,936 --> 00:43:29,054
He doesn't know anything.

881
00:43:29,468 --> 00:43:30,468
Ok, Mushnick.

882
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:32,218
If you hear anything about these men...

883
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:33,162
call our office.

884
00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:34,833
Sure, I'll be glad to...

885
00:43:34,881 --> 00:43:36,787
cooperate with the police.

886
00:43:37,045 --> 00:43:38,045
Hello, aunt Siddie.

887
00:43:38,070 --> 00:43:41,099
Oh, isn't it terrible what
happened to your boy, Frankie?

888
00:43:41,124 --> 00:43:42,639
Those are the breaks.

889
00:43:47,116 --> 00:43:48,155
Alright, Seymour.

890
00:43:48,180 --> 00:43:51,795
Now you tell me if this plant
is finished all grown up.

891
00:43:52,288 --> 00:43:54,679
- It's finished all growning up.
- You wouldn't kid your father?

892
00:43:54,741 --> 00:43:56,514
- My father came home?
- Me, idiot!

893
00:43:56,539 --> 00:43:58,014
It's a finger of speech.

894
00:43:58,139 --> 00:43:59,139
Now look...

895
00:43:59,164 --> 00:44:01,400
I can't stand anymore that plant.

896
00:44:01,425 --> 00:44:03,865
It's growing me out of house and home.

897
00:44:04,225 --> 00:44:06,170
It ain't gonna grow anymore. I promise.

898
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:07,787
How can you be so sure?

899
00:44:08,178 --> 00:44:09,779
It ate three times already.

900
00:44:10,075 --> 00:44:11,356
Who...
I mean...

901
00:44:11,536 --> 00:44:13,575
what did it eat this time?

902
00:44:13,739 --> 00:44:16,145
Well, abou...
about a million Japanese beetles.

903
00:44:16,630 --> 00:44:18,098
So don't eat no more?

904
00:44:19,309 --> 00:44:20,309
It's full.

905
00:44:20,403 --> 00:44:21,403
Gravis?

906
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,503
There's a lady from some kind
of a committance outside.

907
00:44:25,590 --> 00:44:27,058
I think it's important.

908
00:44:28,284 --> 00:44:29,284
Excellent.

909
00:44:29,355 --> 00:44:30,363
By the by...

910
00:44:30,941 --> 00:44:33,534
I understand you want to take
Audrey out on a date tonight.

911
00:44:33,957 --> 00:44:35,222
That's very good with me.

912
00:44:35,534 --> 00:44:38,706
Because I am staying to keep an
eye on that meshugana plant.

913
00:44:43,308 --> 00:44:45,152
So, where are we gonna go tonight, Seymour.

914
00:44:45,644 --> 00:44:47,931
I-I-I just remembered:
I don't have any money.

915
00:44:48,613 --> 00:44:49,769
Well, that's ok.

916
00:44:50,159 --> 00:44:52,878
We could take a walk along
the ocean or something.

917
00:44:53,831 --> 00:44:56,128
I got a great idea.
We could eat dinner at my house.

918
00:44:56,213 --> 00:44:58,643
- My mom's a great cook.
- Oh, that's swell!

919
00:44:58,682 --> 00:45:00,573
Oh, boy, I'll call later and tell her.

920
00:45:00,667 --> 00:45:01,456
Ok.

921
00:45:05,509 --> 00:45:08,345
Oh, that's remarkable.

922
00:45:08,852 --> 00:45:09,852
You like?

923
00:45:10,979 --> 00:45:13,840
I neither like nor dislike
anything, my goodness.

924
00:45:15,826 --> 00:45:18,178
I happen to represent the society of...

925
00:45:18,464 --> 00:45:21,490
Silent Flower Observers of Southern California.

926
00:45:21,553 --> 00:45:22,943
How about that?

927
00:45:23,295 --> 00:45:24,295
Tell me...

928
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:27,630
who created this magnificent bloom?

929
00:45:29,008 --> 00:45:30,383
I did. Me.

930
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:31,233
Oh.

931
00:45:31,258 --> 00:45:33,453
A-a-and what might your name be?

932
00:45:33,571 --> 00:45:35,422
Seymour Krelborn, with a K.

933
00:45:35,835 --> 00:45:37,640
- Krelboind?
- Krelborn.

934
00:45:38,163 --> 00:45:39,796
Raised in the coffee can.

935
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:41,600
This...

936
00:45:41,835 --> 00:45:42,716
Well...

937
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:44,499
Tell me, Mr. Krelboind...

938
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:48,061
Is this a freak or can more
be raised from the seeds?

939
00:45:48,148 --> 00:45:49,303
We should live so long.

940
00:45:49,342 --> 00:45:51,762
Well, I don't think there gonna
be will be any more, Miss, uh,

941
00:45:51,787 --> 00:45:52,787
Feuchtwanger.

942
00:45:52,811 --> 00:45:54,577
Mrs Hortense Feuchtwanger.

943
00:45:54,701 --> 00:45:57,896
I think this is gonna be the only one,
Mrs. Fishswinger.

944
00:45:58,466 --> 00:45:59,466
Feuchtwanger.

945
00:46:00,115 --> 00:46:01,131
Feuchtwanger?

946
00:46:01,242 --> 00:46:03,005
Well, it's probably indigestible anyway.

947
00:46:06,164 --> 00:46:07,164
At any rate...

948
00:46:07,836 --> 00:46:11,031
I have the honour to tell you,
Seymour Krelboind,

949
00:46:11,531 --> 00:46:15,031
that you have been selected
to receive the annual trophy...

950
00:46:15,056 --> 00:46:18,788
of the Society of Silent Flower
Observers of Southern California.

951
00:46:18,836 --> 00:46:20,234
A trophy? Me?

952
00:46:20,281 --> 00:46:22,367
Such is justice...

953
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:26,325
But tell me: When do you suppose
those large buds will open?

954
00:46:26,678 --> 00:46:29,670
Well according to what the book says
about the plants that I crossed...

955
00:46:29,970 --> 00:46:32,369
they should open the day after tomorrow at sunset.

956
00:46:32,496 --> 00:46:33,717
Ah, very well.

957
00:46:33,748 --> 00:46:36,053
Then I shall return at that
time to present the trophy

958
00:46:36,265 --> 00:46:37,265
Good day.

959
00:46:44,045 --> 00:46:45,201
Remarkable.

960
00:46:49,763 --> 00:46:51,818
Oh boy!
I'm gonna get a trophy!

961
00:46:51,849 --> 00:46:53,848
Oh, Seymour. I'm so proud of you.

962
00:46:53,873 --> 00:46:56,676
Oh, a real trophy for Audrey Jr.!

963
00:46:56,701 --> 00:46:58,914
- We'll put it on the float.
- In the rose parade.

964
00:46:58,951 --> 00:47:00,178
Oh, boy!

965
00:47:03,950 --> 00:47:05,997
Don't look at me.
I-I'm a terrible sight.

966
00:47:06,169 --> 00:47:07,927
I-I'm a complete sea hag.

967
00:47:08,098 --> 00:47:10,036
- She always says that.
- O, well, it's true.

968
00:47:10,107 --> 00:47:12,200
I haven't been feelin' very well lately.

969
00:47:12,395 --> 00:47:14,833
Audrey, this is my ma, Winifred Krelborn.

970
00:47:14,879 --> 00:47:16,520
Ma, this is Audrey Fulquard.

971
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:17,442
She's my girl.

972
00:47:17,467 --> 00:47:19,263
Hi Audrey. Are you hungry?

973
00:47:19,288 --> 00:47:21,295
I sure am. I could eat a horse.

974
00:47:21,320 --> 00:47:24,623
Oh. Well, sit right down,
and I'll go get the first course.

975
00:47:28,498 --> 00:47:29,498
Sit here, Audrey.

976
00:47:30,748 --> 00:47:31,935
You want me to take your sweater?

977
00:47:32,193 --> 00:47:33,467
Well... yeah.

978
00:47:41,882 --> 00:47:42,953
Never mind that.

979
00:47:43,219 --> 00:47:44,719
Well, now try this.

980
00:47:51,532 --> 00:47:53,313
It tastes like cough syrup.

981
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:55,423
Dr. Phlegm's cough syrup

982
00:47:55,650 --> 00:47:56,650
A toast?

983
00:47:57,944 --> 00:48:00,570
- To Audrey Jr.!
- No, to Audrey Sr.!

984
00:48:24,310 --> 00:48:26,427
You! You glutton, you!

985
00:48:26,746 --> 00:48:28,262
Tonight I keep an eye on you.

986
00:48:28,287 --> 00:48:30,911
I don't let nobody get near you.

987
00:48:41,370 --> 00:48:42,768
Coming soup.

988
00:48:44,323 --> 00:48:46,792
No, don't touch it till I
get a little flavouring.

989
00:48:47,956 --> 00:48:48,956
Gee, Audrey.

990
00:48:48,994 --> 00:48:50,770
You sure look good by candlelight.

991
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:52,815
Do I really, Seymour?

992
00:48:52,854 --> 00:48:54,643
- Yes.
- Here you are.

993
00:48:57,525 --> 00:48:58,525
Now try.

994
00:48:59,377 --> 00:49:00,728
Sure smells different.

995
00:49:00,814 --> 00:49:01,986
It's different.

996
00:49:03,189 --> 00:49:04,861
Some kind of oil, isn't it?

997
00:49:05,195 --> 00:49:06,398
Cod liver oil.

998
00:49:06,952 --> 00:49:08,358
Wonderful for the colon.

999
00:49:08,476 --> 00:49:10,499
And that's sulphur powder on top.

1000
00:49:15,819 --> 00:49:19,038
Feed me.

1001
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,202
Feed me!

1002
00:49:27,124 --> 00:49:29,328
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

1003
00:49:37,797 --> 00:49:38,797
Open it is.

1004
00:49:38,968 --> 00:49:40,266
<i>Feed me!</i>

1005
00:49:43,797 --> 00:49:44,828
I didn't hear it.

1006
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,468
<i>Feed me!</i>

1007
00:49:46,493 --> 00:49:47,493
I heard it.

1008
00:49:48,406 --> 00:49:50,797
I want food.

1009
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:53,601
A talking plant we got.

1010
00:49:53,742 --> 00:49:55,758
<i>I'm hungry.</i>

1011
00:49:56,109 --> 00:49:57,109
No.

1012
00:49:57,508 --> 00:49:58,508
Hungry?

1013
00:49:59,015 --> 00:50:01,258
And other fine kettle von fish!

1014
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:04,124
Who would you like to have tonight?

1015
00:50:04,819 --> 00:50:06,577
You look fat enough.

1016
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:12,342
We not only got a talking plant,
we got one that makes with smart cracks.

1017
00:50:12,999 --> 00:50:16,053
Will you listen to me, you botanical bum?

1018
00:50:16,389 --> 00:50:17,717
Food you wouldn't get.

1019
00:50:18,108 --> 00:50:19,600
Not from Gravis Mushnick.

1020
00:50:19,733 --> 00:50:21,334
I'm starved.

1021
00:50:21,450 --> 00:50:22,561
Excellent.

1022
00:50:23,006 --> 00:50:25,296
You would unpopulate all Skid Row.

1023
00:50:25,491 --> 00:50:26,491
Well...

1024
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:28,979
You can forget about it.

1025
00:50:29,373 --> 00:50:31,980
You wouldn't get fed from
Gravis mushnick tonight.

1026
00:50:33,623 --> 00:50:34,623
Good night

1027
00:50:35,201 --> 00:50:36,912
You'll get yours.

1028
00:50:44,099 --> 00:50:45,794
I kinda like this chow mein.

1029
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:47,458
Uh, if it tastes a little bitter...

1030
00:50:47,483 --> 00:50:50,466
it's because it's made
of Chinese herbs and it's...

1031
00:50:50,677 --> 00:50:52,219
flavored with accra myosin.

1032
00:50:52,388 --> 00:50:53,388
Epsom salt.

1033
00:50:53,825 --> 00:50:56,209
There ain't another cook in
the whole world like my ma.

1034
00:50:56,255 --> 00:50:58,888
That's what your old man said
before the last ran out on me.

1035
00:50:58,958 --> 00:51:01,888
You know, if you're gonna be
married, you gotta be a good cook.

1036
00:51:02,389 --> 00:51:04,092
Maybe you could teach me.

1037
00:51:04,233 --> 00:51:05,608
You thinkin' to get married?

1038
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:08,788
- He hasn't asked me yet.
- Who hasn't?

1039
00:51:09,015 --> 00:51:10,015
Seymour.

1040
00:51:10,241 --> 00:51:11,999
Seymour's too young to get married.

1041
00:51:12,147 --> 00:51:15,385
Look here. A boy's got to go
and play around a little bit.

1042
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:16,678
Go out on the makin'.

1043
00:51:16,703 --> 00:51:17,773
Have a ball.

1044
00:51:18,006 --> 00:51:20,780
Gee, ma. I don't wanna have a ball.
I wanna be with Audrey.

1045
00:51:20,928 --> 00:51:22,752
- Now look, Seymour.
- Oh, Seymour.

1046
00:51:22,839 --> 00:51:26,402
You promised you wouldn't get married
until you bought me an iron lung.

1047
00:51:26,738 --> 00:51:28,644
You've been breathing for years, ma.

1048
00:51:28,769 --> 00:51:29,980
Well, it ain't easy.

1049
00:51:30,191 --> 00:51:31,832
It ain't easy, son.

1050
00:51:53,837 --> 00:51:55,001
Nobody's here.

1051
00:51:55,470 --> 00:51:57,548
Black cats, 13th job...

1052
00:51:57,573 --> 00:52:00,050
Friday 13th. Stupid superstition.

1053
00:52:04,385 --> 00:52:05,385
Alright, you.

1054
00:52:05,410 --> 00:52:06,479
Come out of there.

1055
00:52:06,981 --> 00:52:08,184
Don't shoot, Mister.

1056
00:52:08,605 --> 00:52:11,402
I'm old and sick.
I wouldn't hurt even a fly.

1057
00:52:12,652 --> 00:52:14,369
Come out in the light where I can see you.

1058
00:52:15,948 --> 00:52:16,948
Come on.

1059
00:52:16,973 --> 00:52:18,129
Please don't shoot.

1060
00:52:18,231 --> 00:52:19,231
Please.

1061
00:52:19,347 --> 00:52:21,762
Please. I'm only Gravis Mushnick.
You wouldn't want to kill me.

1062
00:52:21,793 --> 00:52:22,993
Where would you hide the body?

1063
00:52:23,395 --> 00:52:25,325
Don't worry. I'm not gonna shoot you.

1064
00:52:25,793 --> 00:52:27,394
- Not unless you try something.
- Try something?

1065
00:52:27,419 --> 00:52:29,004
I never tried anything in my life.

1066
00:52:29,317 --> 00:52:31,676
I wouldn't try anything now.
You want my money? Take it.

1067
00:52:31,701 --> 00:52:35,003
You want I should go out and steal you
some more? That's alright, too. I'll do it.

1068
00:52:35,378 --> 00:52:36,753
Thank you very much.

1069
00:52:37,722 --> 00:52:39,792
I like your brand of hospitality.

1070
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:43,260
You'll excuse it isn't more.
I'm only a poor florist

1071
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,285
Yeah, yeah.

1072
00:52:45,486 --> 00:52:46,971
You got about 30 bucks here.

1073
00:52:47,650 --> 00:52:49,189
Come on now. Where's the rest of it?

1074
00:52:49,329 --> 00:52:52,556
I was in here this afternoon.
I saw about 30,000 people in here...

1075
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:54,071
They must have spent some money. Where is it?

1076
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:56,306
There ain't no more money.
They came in to look on the plant.

1077
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:58,415
It's a big attraction.
Audrey Jr.

1078
00:52:58,831 --> 00:52:59,870
The plant. Don't try to snow me, Jim.

1079
00:52:59,895 --> 00:53:01,995
30,000 square didn't come
in just to look for a plant.

1080
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:03,019
I want it!

1081
00:53:04,150 --> 00:53:06,439
I don't got no more money.
Honest. Believe me.

1082
00:53:06,486 --> 00:53:07,564
Ok, let's try this.

1083
00:53:07,806 --> 00:53:08,806
One...

1084
00:53:09,017 --> 00:53:10,017
Two...

1085
00:53:10,088 --> 00:53:11,088
Three...

1086
00:53:11,234 --> 00:53:13,573
- Four...
- I ain't got no more money, honest!

1087
00:53:13,804 --> 00:53:16,147
Alright. Try it the other way around.
Five...

1088
00:53:16,203 --> 00:53:17,203
Four...

1089
00:53:17,241 --> 00:53:18,241
Three...

1090
00:53:18,289 --> 00:53:19,367
- Two...
- Alright.

1091
00:53:19,392 --> 00:53:20,460
Alright.

1092
00:53:20,579 --> 00:53:21,907
Alright, big bad. Where?

1093
00:53:23,665 --> 00:53:24,868
In the plant.

1094
00:53:25,645 --> 00:53:26,904
In the plant?

1095
00:53:27,593 --> 00:53:29,552
The big plant, Audrey Jr.

1096
00:53:32,941 --> 00:53:34,449
I-inside the big leaf?

1097
00:53:34,637 --> 00:53:36,333
That's right. Inside.

1098
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,270
H-h-how do you get it open?

1099
00:53:40,965 --> 00:53:41,965
Just knock.

1100
00:53:58,424 --> 00:53:59,424
In there?

1101
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:00,449
In there.

1102
00:54:01,221 --> 00:54:02,221
Inside.

1103
00:54:02,478 --> 00:54:03,618
In the bottom.

1104
00:54:03,643 --> 00:54:04,846
I don't see anything.

1105
00:54:06,399 --> 00:54:07,759
Way inside.

1106
00:54:08,291 --> 00:54:09,627
Right at the bottom.

1107
00:54:22,942 --> 00:54:24,380
Argh!

1108
00:54:29,077 --> 00:54:30,652
Oi, what I did?

1109
00:54:34,575 --> 00:54:37,348
I don't care about you got
a date with Audrey tonight.

1110
00:54:37,373 --> 00:54:40,325
I am no more sitting up
with that no-goodnik plant.

1111
00:54:42,653 --> 00:54:45,309
But, see, Mr. Mushnick,
you don't have to sit up with it any more.

1112
00:54:45,334 --> 00:54:46,997
- It's all grown up now.
- Excellent.

1113
00:54:47,450 --> 00:54:50,200
Smart guy. How do you know
it don't be hungry no more?

1114
00:54:50,225 --> 00:54:52,548
- Well because...
- Tonight you are staying!

1115
00:54:52,713 --> 00:54:55,174
Then tomorrow they are coming and
they are going to give you a trophy...

1116
00:54:55,199 --> 00:54:59,267
and then after that we are getting
rid once and for all for that plant!

1117
00:54:59,431 --> 00:55:02,478
- Getting rid of it? Why?
- Don't ask. Why? Why?

1118
00:55:02,555 --> 00:55:04,430
The end. Into the garbage can.

1119
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:05,907
Aloha.

1120
00:55:05,993 --> 00:55:08,228
Oi.
Yes, Mrs. Shiva?

1121
00:55:08,290 --> 00:55:09,470
Oh, Seymour.

1122
00:55:09,501 --> 00:55:11,179
Your wonderful plant!

1123
00:55:11,204 --> 00:55:12,618
Oh, that's alright, Audrey.

1124
00:55:12,696 --> 00:55:15,048
I'll grow other plants,
even more wonderful ones.

1125
00:55:15,321 --> 00:55:16,649
I know you will.

1126
00:55:17,297 --> 00:55:19,274
Did you figure out what
we're doing tonight?

1127
00:55:19,790 --> 00:55:22,617
Yeah we're going to place
full of beautiful flowers.

1128
00:55:23,082 --> 00:55:25,035
- We have to stay here.
- Yeah.

1129
00:55:25,355 --> 00:55:27,748
Well, never mind. We'll have a picnic.

1130
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:29,660
It'll be just like going to the country.

1131
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:31,075
- Oh, boy!
<i>- ... flowers and...</i>

1132
00:55:31,100 --> 00:55:32,652
<i>and pink azaleas, for the arbour,</i>

1133
00:55:32,677 --> 00:55:35,542
- ... and the 9000 yellow mons for the...
- For the border.

1134
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:38,728
- And the... the roses
- I got them around the back.

1135
00:55:40,146 --> 00:55:43,730
What do you mean you're going to a
picnic at night with that Fulquard girl?

1136
00:55:43,950 --> 00:55:45,411
Don't you like Audrey, ma?

1137
00:55:45,489 --> 00:55:46,938
She's out after your money.

1138
00:55:47,184 --> 00:55:48,458
I don't have any money.

1139
00:55:48,520 --> 00:55:50,445
Oh, she's a smart one.

1140
00:55:50,645 --> 00:55:54,692
She'll latch onto ya till ya get
some and then goodbye, fortune!

1141
00:55:54,911 --> 00:55:56,786
But Audrey's honest girl, ma.

1142
00:55:56,848 --> 00:55:59,747
Yeah, never trust a woman who's too healthy

1143
00:56:00,121 --> 00:56:02,433
But Audrey had a bad cold a few weeks ago.

1144
00:56:02,504 --> 00:56:04,848
Oh, cold, a puny cold.

1145
00:56:05,105 --> 00:56:07,215
Why don't you get yourself
a real female with...

1146
00:56:07,240 --> 00:56:08,637
something decent like...

1147
00:56:08,662 --> 00:56:11,283
pneumonoconiosis, or-or gall stones?

1148
00:56:11,338 --> 00:56:13,238
Well, maybe she could
catch something like that.

1149
00:56:13,263 --> 00:56:15,748
The only thing she'll catch is you.

1150
00:56:16,380 --> 00:56:19,130
And she'll take you off to
some shady sanatorium...

1151
00:56:19,155 --> 00:56:22,484
and leave me to
chiropractors and faith healers.

1152
00:56:23,069 --> 00:56:24,990
I know when I'm not wanted.

1153
00:56:26,069 --> 00:56:27,662
Oh, gee, ma.

1154
00:56:27,687 --> 00:56:29,491
Don't feel sorry for me.

1155
00:56:30,218 --> 00:56:32,975
I'll just find a nice,
wet alley somewhere...

1156
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,046
and curl up and wait for the end.

1157
00:56:35,304 --> 00:56:37,913
Oh, please don't die till I get
back, will you ma?

1158
00:56:37,991 --> 00:56:40,483
I'll take care of you.
I'll always take care of you, I promise!

1159
00:56:40,508 --> 00:56:41,913
- Yeah.
- Bye.

1160
00:56:48,140 --> 00:56:50,554
Gee, Audrey, I've never
tasted food like this before.

1161
00:56:50,945 --> 00:56:53,163
It's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich

1162
00:56:53,296 --> 00:56:55,208
Peanut butter and jelly -
what does that cure?

1163
00:56:55,725 --> 00:56:57,504
Nothing. It's just a food.

1164
00:56:57,591 --> 00:56:59,481
What good is it if it
doesn't clear up pimples...

1165
00:56:59,506 --> 00:57:01,498
or shrink your sinus
tissues or something?

1166
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:03,779
You're just being silly, Seymour.

1167
00:57:05,146 --> 00:57:07,280
Seymour, what do you wanna be?

1168
00:57:08,052 --> 00:57:09,732
Oh, I wanna grow things.

1169
00:57:10,113 --> 00:57:12,169
If I had a lot of money,
I'd go to the South Seas,

1170
00:57:12,194 --> 00:57:14,567
where they grow the most
fabulous plants in the world.

1171
00:57:14,661 --> 00:57:16,215
That sounds exciting.

1172
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:17,560
Yeah.

1173
00:57:17,585 --> 00:57:20,005
I'd like to go to the South Seas, too.

1174
00:57:20,106 --> 00:57:21,996
There's no reason why you couldn't go.

1175
00:57:22,644 --> 00:57:24,579
Would you take me with you, Seymour?

1176
00:57:24,644 --> 00:57:27,348
Oh, I couldn't very well
go without you, Audrey.

1177
00:57:27,606 --> 00:57:28,606
Why not?

1178
00:57:29,129 --> 00:57:30,129
Because...

1179
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:31,918
Because I'm in love with you, Audrey.

1180
00:57:32,176 --> 00:57:34,285
Oh, I'm in love with you, too, Seymour.

1181
00:57:35,230 --> 00:57:36,511
<i>Feed me.</i>

1182
00:57:37,495 --> 00:57:38,495
What'd you say?

1183
00:57:38,675 --> 00:57:40,050
I'm...
I'm just kidding.

1184
00:57:41,121 --> 00:57:42,902
<i>I'm hungry!</i>

1185
00:57:42,934 --> 00:57:43,934
Seymour!

1186
00:57:44,105 --> 00:57:46,519
- I didn't mean it.
- Why did you say it?

1187
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:49,238
<i>Oh.
Food.</i>

1188
00:57:49,847 --> 00:57:51,144
You didn't even say that.

1189
00:57:51,169 --> 00:57:52,894
Oh yes I did.
I said it. I said it.

1190
00:57:52,933 --> 00:57:54,683
Oh, I'm looking right at you.

1191
00:57:55,026 --> 00:57:57,019
Well, I'm a ventriloquist.

1192
00:57:57,138 --> 00:57:57,955
You're what?

1193
00:57:57,980 --> 00:58:00,096
- A ventrilo...
<i>- Feed me!</i>

1194
00:58:00,924 --> 00:58:02,620
Seymour, do you feel all right?

1195
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:04,697
Well, I don't know.
I'm not sure.

1196
00:58:04,885 --> 00:58:07,667
Well, then stop all this
nonsense and kiss me.

1197
00:58:08,573 --> 00:58:10,823
<i>I'm dying from hunger!</i>

1198
00:58:10,848 --> 00:58:13,494
Alright, if you're so
hungry, eat something but...

1199
00:58:13,697 --> 00:58:14,799
forget about me.

1200
00:58:14,967 --> 00:58:15,967
Gee, I'm sorry, Audrey.

1201
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:17,812
<i>Give me to eat!</i>

1202
00:58:17,851 --> 00:58:20,335
If you can't control
yourself, I'm going home.

1203
00:58:20,360 --> 00:58:22,484
<i>I need some chow.</i>

1204
00:58:24,618 --> 00:58:26,977
Ooh, my empty stomach.

1205
00:58:28,259 --> 00:58:30,564
Audrey, please wait.
Listen to me.

1206
00:58:30,658 --> 00:58:33,580
I've listened to all the
nonsense I wanna hear, Seymour.

1207
00:58:33,814 --> 00:58:34,877
You're a nut.

1208
00:58:34,951 --> 00:58:38,429
You tell me that you love me and then
you you act like a complete idiot.

1209
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,970
Please listen, Audrey.

1210
00:58:40,033 --> 00:58:42,150
I'll be able to explain everything soon.

1211
00:58:42,300 --> 00:58:44,245
Why can't you explain now?

1212
00:58:44,847 --> 00:58:46,956
Because so many things are so important.

1213
00:58:47,433 --> 00:58:48,573
I wanna marry you.

1214
00:58:48,698 --> 00:58:50,518
But I gotta take care of mom.

1215
00:58:50,745 --> 00:58:53,354
Well, that plant in there is
gonna make it all come true.

1216
00:58:54,108 --> 00:58:56,608
Tomorrow they're gonna give me
a trophy and I'll be famous.

1217
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:58,249
I'll be a big botanist.

1218
00:58:58,702 --> 00:59:01,381
And then we can go to the South
Seas just like we planned and all.

1219
00:59:01,406 --> 00:59:04,499
But that doesn't have anything
to do with what went on in there.

1220
00:59:05,202 --> 00:59:07,538
When you're ready to come to your
senses, Seymour,

1221
00:59:07,866 --> 00:59:09,265
then I'll talk to you.

1222
00:59:09,928 --> 00:59:11,099
Good night, Seymour.

1223
00:59:19,812 --> 00:59:21,421
<i>Feed.</i>

1224
00:59:22,272 --> 00:59:23,952
I'm getting pretty tired of you.

1225
00:59:24,156 --> 00:59:26,062
I need food.

1226
00:59:26,101 --> 00:59:27,374
I don't care what you need.

1227
00:59:27,437 --> 00:59:28,648
Look what you've done to me.

1228
00:59:28,718 --> 00:59:31,554
You not only made a butcher outta
me, you drove my girl away.

1229
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:34,132
Shut up, and bring on the food!

1230
00:59:34,576 --> 00:59:36,428
Don't tell me to shut up - you shut up!

1231
00:59:37,194 --> 00:59:38,997
Who raised you from a
bunch of little seeds?

1232
00:59:39,154 --> 00:59:43,009
Who fed you all them high-class fertilizers
and sat up with you when you were sick?

1233
00:59:43,373 --> 00:59:45,162
Nodody else would have done that for you.

1234
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:48,161
You think anybody else would have
brought you human beings to eat?

1235
00:59:48,512 --> 00:59:49,864
Darm right, they wouldn't.

1236
00:59:50,227 --> 00:59:52,906
Well, I've helped you and you've helped me.

1237
00:59:52,931 --> 00:59:55,181
Now shut your trap and go to sleep.
I'm tired.

1238
00:59:55,337 --> 00:59:56,337
<i>Krelborn!</i>

1239
00:59:57,055 --> 00:59:58,055
Turn around!

1240
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:01,914
<i>Close your eyes.</i>

1241
01:00:03,688 --> 01:00:05,360
<i>You are asleep.</i>

1242
01:00:06,594 --> 01:00:07,930
Open your eyes.

1243
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:11,472
Now you will do as I say.

1244
01:00:11,555 --> 01:00:12,906
Will you follow me?

1245
01:00:12,992 --> 01:00:14,188
Yes, master.

1246
01:00:14,468 --> 01:00:18,796
You will go out and
find me some food!

1247
01:00:19,109 --> 01:00:20,335
Yes, master.

1248
01:00:20,476 --> 01:00:21,921
<i>Now begone.</i>

1249
01:00:22,342 --> 01:00:24,014
<i>And waste no time.</i>

1250
01:00:44,701 --> 01:00:45,701
<i>Idiot!</i>

1251
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:28,145
My name is Leonora Clyde.

1252
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:30,731
How's the rain on the rhubarb?

1253
01:01:32,030 --> 01:01:33,856
Master is hungry.

1254
01:01:43,542 --> 01:01:44,909
Well, hello there.

1255
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,610
I gotta find food for master.

1256
01:02:18,337 --> 01:02:20,360
Food I gotta find for master.

1257
01:02:21,297 --> 01:02:23,866
For master I gotta find food.

1258
01:02:25,047 --> 01:02:26,570
Maybe I can help.

1259
01:02:27,414 --> 01:02:30,085
- Who're you?
- My name is Leonora Clyde.

1260
01:02:30,110 --> 01:02:31,515
I love you.

1261
01:02:32,665 --> 01:02:34,516
Master wants food.

1262
01:02:34,915 --> 01:02:36,563
Let the old goat wait.

1263
01:02:36,641 --> 01:02:38,977
The night is young and so are we.

1264
01:02:39,219 --> 01:02:40,907
Master doesn't eat goat.

1265
01:02:45,458 --> 01:02:48,239
Well what kind of food does he like?

1266
01:02:51,005 --> 01:02:52,137
Oooh.

1267
01:02:52,927 --> 01:02:54,342
That's more like it.

1268
01:02:54,367 --> 01:02:55,367
Kiss me!

1269
01:02:59,272 --> 01:03:01,209
What's the matter, don't you like me?

1270
01:03:01,483 --> 01:03:02,725
Too bony.

1271
01:03:02,763 --> 01:03:03,869
Too bony?

1272
01:03:03,870 --> 01:03:05,442
Nobody ever told me that before.

1273
01:03:05,467 --> 01:03:07,302
Beef is better than veal.

1274
01:03:07,998 --> 01:03:08,998
Ach.

1275
01:03:09,060 --> 01:03:10,545
You're such a dodo.

1276
01:03:10,661 --> 01:03:13,013
What do you call this?
Chopped liver?

1277
01:03:13,904 --> 01:03:14,904
Mmm.

1278
01:03:15,489 --> 01:03:16,888
Haha.

1279
01:03:17,224 --> 01:03:19,271
Master would like more fat.

1280
01:03:19,544 --> 01:03:21,465
Speak for yourself, John.

1281
01:03:23,317 --> 01:03:24,789
My name is Seymour.

1282
01:03:24,902 --> 01:03:26,543
"My name is Seymour."

1283
01:03:26,801 --> 01:03:28,153
That's my name, too.

1284
01:03:29,043 --> 01:03:32,371
Ach. Are you interested are
you just wasting my time?

1285
01:03:32,723 --> 01:03:34,895
I never thought anybody would volunteer.

1286
01:03:35,036 --> 01:03:36,200
Do you volunteer?

1287
01:03:36,294 --> 01:03:37,630
Sure I do.

1288
01:03:38,192 --> 01:03:40,824
Alright, if you're sure
you want to... volunteer.

1289
01:03:41,207 --> 01:03:43,309
Alright. My place or yours?

1290
01:03:43,471 --> 01:03:44,565
I don't care.

1291
01:03:44,871 --> 01:03:46,817
Well,
flip a coin.

1292
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,598
I don't have a coin.

1293
01:03:49,145 --> 01:03:50,785
Flip anything, silly.

1294
01:03:51,435 --> 01:03:52,840
Well, there's a rock.

1295
01:03:55,606 --> 01:03:56,972
Wet or dry?

1296
01:03:57,051 --> 01:03:58,051
Wet.

1297
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:17,112
<i>The search was narrowing...</i>

1298
01:04:17,347 --> 01:04:19,378
<i>and we knew that soon
we would have the killer.</i>

1299
01:04:19,901 --> 01:04:21,932
<i>Not that we had any more clues than before.</i>

1300
01:04:22,042 --> 01:04:23,667
<i>But we had to tell the chief something.</i>

1301
01:04:23,876 --> 01:04:26,915
<i>I had that feeling in my bones that the
mystery was frawing to its climax.</i>

1302
01:04:27,002 --> 01:04:28,815
<i>And I was determined to be on hand.</i>

1303
01:04:29,869 --> 01:04:31,165
Alright.
Out, out, out.

1304
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:32,197
Nobody is in.

1305
01:04:32,222 --> 01:04:34,775
Today we have a special
occasion for Seymour Krelborn...

1306
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,665
which has invented a big plant.

1307
01:04:36,690 --> 01:04:39,151
So I want everybody just please
stay out of the way.

1308
01:04:39,176 --> 01:04:42,408
We want Seymour!
We want Seymour!

1309
01:04:42,432 --> 01:04:44,128
We want Seymour!

1310
01:04:49,940 --> 01:04:54,197
I tell you, this business is worse than
being a conductor in a revoluting door.

1311
01:04:54,253 --> 01:04:56,354
I'll be glad when this day is finished.

1312
01:04:56,379 --> 01:04:57,535
But the celebration!

1313
01:04:57,560 --> 01:04:59,925
They're presenting my son with a trophy.

1314
01:05:00,053 --> 01:05:01,707
Yeah? What'd he do -
run away from home?

1315
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:03,863
Please don't look at me that way, Audrey.

1316
01:05:04,004 --> 01:05:05,238
I wanna talk to you.

1317
01:05:05,582 --> 01:05:06,886
I'm sorry Seymour.

1318
01:05:07,551 --> 01:05:09,207
I just don't understand you.

1319
01:05:09,232 --> 01:05:11,285
I'll explain everything after the ceremony.

1320
01:05:11,310 --> 01:05:13,224
Yo! Police - what are you doing here?

1321
01:05:13,249 --> 01:05:14,927
Heard there was something
going on here this evening.

1322
01:05:14,952 --> 01:05:16,794
Just so, we'd keep come by,
keep an eye on things

1323
01:05:16,819 --> 01:05:19,390
Look we don't need no eyes kept on nothing.
Everything...

1324
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,273
The Society Of Silent Flower
Observers has arrived...

1325
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:24,458
and sunset is almost upon us.

1326
01:05:24,680 --> 01:05:26,438
Welcome, lady and gentlemen.

1327
01:05:26,501 --> 01:05:28,736
We are honoured for to have you.

1328
01:05:29,626 --> 01:05:31,126
Still working on those disappearances.

1329
01:05:31,282 --> 01:05:32,337
We think they were murdered.

1330
01:05:32,362 --> 01:05:33,728
Hey, look here young man.

1331
01:05:33,753 --> 01:05:35,612
That's no way to talk at a time like this.

1332
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:36,925
Let me see your tongue.

1333
01:05:37,479 --> 01:05:38,542
M-hm.

1334
01:05:38,572 --> 01:05:39,644
You know what you got?

1335
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:40,737
Just the facts, ma'am.

1336
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:41,602
Trench mouth.

1337
01:05:41,747 --> 01:05:43,473
Oh, I know, I had it back in '09.

1338
01:05:43,498 --> 01:05:45,978
- Better have that looked into, Frank.
- Whatever you say, Joe.

1339
01:05:47,294 --> 01:05:48,552
Mr. Krelborn?

1340
01:05:48,679 --> 01:05:51,663
Uh, the sun is going down now
and, uh...

1341
01:05:52,358 --> 01:05:54,790
you do think those
buds are going to open?

1342
01:05:55,171 --> 01:05:56,288
I hope so.

1343
01:05:56,334 --> 01:05:58,975
Because if they don't, Mr. Krelborn,

1344
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:01,810
we shall just have to present
the award at another time.

1345
01:06:01,982 --> 01:06:04,310
Oh! It's starting to open!

1346
01:06:05,857 --> 01:06:06,857
<i>Remarkable!</i>

1347
01:06:09,029 --> 01:06:11,826
Oh. Well, the first bud is open.

1348
01:06:17,067 --> 01:06:18,669
- Isn't that...
- The railroad cop.

1349
01:06:18,895 --> 01:06:19,911
Look at the rest.

1350
01:06:30,150 --> 01:06:32,009
Aaaah!

1351
01:06:33,118 --> 01:06:34,118
What do you think, Frank?

1352
01:06:34,151 --> 01:06:35,473
They're all there, Joe.

1353
01:06:35,698 --> 01:06:36,698
Yes, you're right.

1354
01:06:36,822 --> 01:06:38,853
Mr. Krelborn,
how do you explain this?

1355
01:06:38,878 --> 01:06:40,401
I didn't mean it.
I didn't mean it!

1356
01:06:40,426 --> 01:06:42,659
That's right, officer.
He didn't mean to kill them.

1357
01:06:42,816 --> 01:06:43,683
Oh!

1358
01:06:43,776 --> 01:06:46,222
Seymour, you promised you'd explain.

1359
01:06:46,682 --> 01:06:47,971
He's getting away, Joe.

1360
01:06:47,996 --> 01:06:50,065
Yes, you're right.
Let's catch him.

1361
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:51,267
Right.

1362
01:06:56,118 --> 01:06:59,360
- Oh, now the float will be perfect!
- Yeah.

1363
01:10:10,710 --> 01:10:13,140
You wouldn't find him
here with the toilets.

1364
01:10:13,305 --> 01:10:14,711
Let's go back.

1365
01:10:37,155 --> 01:10:40,215
You dirty rat plant.
You messed up my whole life!

1366
01:10:40,547 --> 01:10:43,961
Feed meeeee!

1367
01:10:44,305 --> 01:10:45,711
I'll feed you.

1368
01:10:49,412 --> 01:10:52,045
I'll feed you like you've
never been fed before.

1369
01:11:14,843 --> 01:11:16,561
Better to give up, gentlemen.

1370
01:11:17,319 --> 01:11:19,045
You wouldn't find him tonight.

1371
01:11:19,076 --> 01:11:21,115
Fuck.
The door is open, Frank.

1372
01:11:27,809 --> 01:11:29,815
He was such a good boy.

1373
01:11:33,723 --> 01:11:35,231
Seymour!

1374
01:11:35,629 --> 01:11:37,192
I didn't mean it.
