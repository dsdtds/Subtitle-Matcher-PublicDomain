2
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,108
Looks like a burial.

3
00:01:56,133 --> 00:01:57,842
In the road?

4
00:02:03,616 --> 00:02:05,811
Driver, what is it?

5
00:02:05,835 --> 00:02:08,771
It’s a funeral, Mademoiselle.

6
00:02:08,796 --> 00:02:11,740
They are afraid of the men
who steal dead bodies.

7
00:02:12,351 --> 00:02:16,283
So they dig the grave
in the middle of the road

8
00:02:16,307 --> 00:02:19,708
where people
pass all the time.

9
00:02:28,708 --> 00:02:34,692
Well, that’s a cheerful introduction
for you to our West Indies.

10
00:03:07,939 --> 00:03:11,359
Do you know where is the house of
monsieur Beaumont?

11
00:03:35,797 --> 00:03:38,500
Zombies! Aller vite! Allez!

12
00:03:45,874 --> 00:03:48,289
It felt like hands touching me!

13
00:04:38,715 --> 00:04:41,481
Why did you drive like that, you fool?
We might have been killed!

14
00:04:41,506 --> 00:04:45,638
Worse than that, Monsieur.
We might have been caught.

15
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,663
Caught? By whom? Those men you spoke to?

16
00:04:48,714 --> 00:04:53,497
They are not men Monsieur,
they are dead bodies.

17
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:54,949
Dead?

18
00:04:55,225 --> 00:04:58,772
Yes, Monsieur. Zombies.

19
00:04:58,796 --> 00:05:00,894
The living dead.

20
00:05:00,918 --> 00:05:07,417
Corpses taken from their graves
who are made to work in sugar mills

21
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,356
and fields at nights.

22
00:05:13,345 --> 00:05:16,780
Look! Here they come!

23
00:05:25,610 --> 00:05:27,765
Look! Look!

24
00:05:39,387 --> 00:05:42,620
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?

25
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:50,179
Did I frighten you? Ha, I’m sorry.
I’m oddly enough I suppose.

26
00:05:50,204 --> 00:05:51,461
No, it wasn’t you.

27
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:53,508
Something happened back on
the road there.

28
00:05:53,716 --> 00:05:55,719
We stopped to speak
to some men.

29
00:05:57,044 --> 00:06:00,913
Our driver told us that they weren’t
men at all. He said they were corpses.

30
00:06:03,618 --> 00:06:04,955
Corpses?

31
00:06:05,727 --> 00:06:08,002
Surely you don’t believe it, do you?

32
00:06:08,027 --> 00:06:15,131
No. But I don’t know, Haiti is full
of nonsense and superstition.

33
00:06:15,332 --> 00:06:19,532
They’re always mixed up with a lot
of mysteries that will turn your hair grey.

34
00:06:20,133 --> 00:06:24,534
I’ve been a missionary
here for, oh, thirty years,

35
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:27,060
and at times I don’t know
what to think.

36
00:06:27,537 --> 00:06:29,309
Come, let’s go
in the house.

37
00:06:29,334 --> 00:06:30,949
Oh, yes, come, dear.

38
00:06:39,726 --> 00:06:42,518
Is Mr. Beaumont in?

39
00:06:42,543 --> 00:06:44,513
You are expected, Dr. Bruner.

40
00:06:44,538 --> 00:06:48,717
Yes... I’ve been sent for to marry someone.

41
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:52,232
Maybe you...

42
00:07:04,002 --> 00:07:08,691
How long is it that you’ve
known Mr. Beaumont?

43
00:07:08,716 --> 00:07:09,920
Oh, only a few days.

44
00:07:09,945 --> 00:07:12,874
Madeline introduced him
on the docks in Port-au-Prince.

45
00:07:12,898 --> 00:07:14,429
Ah, and you?

46
00:07:14,454 --> 00:07:17,015
I met him on the ship
coming from New York.

47
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:19,005
He was very kind during the voyage.

48
00:07:19,363 --> 00:07:22,002
Madeline and I planned to be married
the moment she arrived,

49
00:07:22,156 --> 00:07:25,005
but Mr. Beaumont
persuaded us to come here.

50
00:07:25,053 --> 00:07:27,786
And he promised to take me out
of the bank at Port-au-Prince

51
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:30,042
and send me to New York as his agent.

52
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:33,043
Strange.

53
00:07:34,411 --> 00:07:36,084
Very strange.

54
00:07:36,491 --> 00:07:37,491
You...

55
00:07:39,717 --> 00:07:42,547
I’ll tell Mr. Beaumont you are here.

56
00:07:51,802 --> 00:07:53,998
It’s all right, isn’t it, doctor?

57
00:07:54,022 --> 00:07:56,510
Oh, I guess so.

58
00:07:56,535 --> 00:08:00,805
You see I, I’ve only met Mr.
Beaumont once or twice.

59
00:08:00,829 --> 00:08:05,064
But he never struck me like the man
who would take the trouble

60
00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:08,412
to play fairy godfather
to a young couple like you...

61
00:08:09,809 --> 00:08:11,009
Unless...

62
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,125
Unless what, sir?

63
00:08:28,394 --> 00:08:32,226
I suppose you’ll think
I’m a meddling old fool, but...

64
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:35,083
You know, I’d feel a good deal better
if you’d clear out of this place

65
00:08:35,107 --> 00:08:36,393
after you’re married,

66
00:08:36,417 --> 00:08:38,868
and have nothing more
to do with Mr. Beaumont.

67
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,304
The young people have arrived sir,
and Dr. Bruner.

68
00:08:46,328 --> 00:08:48,587
They are waiting in the reception hall.

69
00:08:49,372 --> 00:08:52,796
Show them to their rooms,
and tell them I’m out.

70
00:08:53,016 --> 00:08:54,502
No wait.

71
00:08:55,266 --> 00:08:57,090
Perhaps I’d better see them.

72
00:08:57,191 --> 00:08:59,002
It might look odd if I didn’t.

73
00:08:59,026 --> 00:09:00,927
Very odd, sir.

74
00:09:00,952 --> 00:09:07,347
Especially as Dr. Bruner is a trifle
skeptical as to your... motives, sir.

75
00:09:07,371 --> 00:09:09,636
Nevermind my motives.

76
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,431
Has that other person sent word yet?

77
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:13,588
No, sir. Not yet.

78
00:09:17,699 --> 00:09:19,099
He’s twenty-four hours late.

79
00:09:21,016 --> 00:09:24,703
I wish you’d keep away
from that man, sir.

80
00:09:25,003 --> 00:09:27,003
He'll make trouble for you.

81
00:09:27,105 --> 00:09:28,730
You needn't worry about that.

82
00:09:28,754 --> 00:09:30,075
I'm not affraid of him.

83
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:34,128
I'm not easily frightened, sir.
You should know that.

84
00:09:34,152 --> 00:09:36,862
But what you are planning is dangerous.

85
00:09:36,886 --> 00:09:39,421
Don’t you suppose I know that, Silver?

86
00:09:39,445 --> 00:09:42,889
You don’t seem to realize what
this girl means to me.

87
00:09:42,913 --> 00:09:46,078
Why, I’d sacrifice anything
I have in the world for her.

88
00:09:47,629 --> 00:09:50,113
Nothing matters
if I can’t have her.

89
00:09:57,769 --> 00:10:01,718
I think, ah, I think you’ll like Haiti.
Most people that...

90
00:10:03,901 --> 00:10:09,621
Madeline! I’m delighted to see you!
Neil, you’re more than welcome.

91
00:10:09,646 --> 00:10:10,721
Thank you, sir.

92
00:10:11,448 --> 00:10:13,522
Doctor, it is very kind of you to come.

93
00:10:13,624 --> 00:10:15,025
I know what a busy man you are.

94
00:10:15,049 --> 00:10:18,285
No, ah, not at all. There is
a native family live out here

95
00:10:18,309 --> 00:10:20,121
that I’ve been trying to see
for a long time.

96
00:10:20,662 --> 00:10:23,826
After this young couple are
safely married, I'll leave.

97
00:10:23,878 --> 00:10:26,329
But surely you will stay for
dinner after the ceremony?

98
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:28,205
No, no, no. No, I must run along.

99
00:10:28,379 --> 00:10:32,531
That’s a great pity. We have something
very special prepared for this occasion.

100
00:10:33,506 --> 00:10:36,930
It was very good of you, Madeline,
to humour the whim of a lonely man.

101
00:10:36,954 --> 00:10:39,044
There was so little time to prepare,

102
00:10:39,068 --> 00:10:41,616
I couldn’t do half the things
I wanted for you.

103
00:10:42,235 --> 00:10:44,882
You’ve done more than enough already
Mr. Beaumont,

104
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:47,773
for a comparative...
giving Neil a position in The States.

105
00:10:48,221 --> 00:10:48,746
Neil?

106
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:50,310
Yes. Yes indeed.

107
00:10:50,334 --> 00:10:53,412
Oh, yes of course! I’m sure Neil
will make a very good agent.

108
00:10:53,799 --> 00:10:55,740
But you must be tired
after your drive.

109
00:10:55,844 --> 00:10:58,589
You get some rest.
Silver!

110
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:02,209
Silver will show you to your rooms.

111
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:03,693
This way please.

112
00:14:30,384 --> 00:14:34,148
Delighted to see you again,
monsieur Beaumont!

113
00:14:47,571 --> 00:14:49,577
Please.

114
00:14:52,674 --> 00:14:54,046
Please.

115
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,394
I’m sorry to have kept
you waiting, monsieur.

116
00:15:05,758 --> 00:15:07,657
I’ve been on a journey

117
00:15:07,804 --> 00:15:10,383
seeking men for my mills.

118
00:15:11,092 --> 00:15:12,568
Men?

119
00:15:12,904 --> 00:15:18,809
They work faithfully...
They are not worried about long hours.

120
00:15:20,471 --> 00:15:25,984
You... can make good use of
men like mine on your plantations.

121
00:15:26,009 --> 00:15:27,060
No.

122
00:15:28,439 --> 00:15:30,813
That’s not what I want.

123
00:15:33,008 --> 00:15:35,488
Then perhaps we should talk
about the young lady

124
00:15:35,513 --> 00:15:37,549
who came to your house this evening?

125
00:15:37,574 --> 00:15:40,539
You’ve seen her? When?

126
00:15:41,533 --> 00:15:43,674
The road, tonight.

127
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,826
There was a young man with her.

128
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:02,526
They are to be married, tonight.

129
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:04,677
You waited too long to do anything.

130
00:16:05,328 --> 00:16:06,907
What do you want me to do?

131
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,723
If she were to disappear,
for a month...

132
00:16:11,907 --> 00:16:16,033
What do you hope to gain
by her disappearance?

133
00:16:16,133 --> 00:16:17,332
Everything...

134
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:18,643
Everything?

135
00:16:18,785 --> 00:16:21,692
Do you think she will forget
her lover in a month?

136
00:16:21,706 --> 00:16:25,662
Just give me a month.
One little month.

137
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:31,339
Not in a month. Not even a year,
monsieur.

138
00:16:33,483 --> 00:16:41,483
I looked into her eyes. She is deep
in love. But not with you.

139
00:16:44,223 --> 00:16:46,262
They are to be married
within an hour!

140
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:48,142
There must be a way!

141
00:16:59,145 --> 00:17:03,153
There is way.

142
00:17:05,854 --> 00:17:07,424
The cost...

143
00:17:08,925 --> 00:17:10,425
The cost is heavy!

144
00:17:11,764 --> 00:17:16,251
You give me what I want,
and you may ask anything.

145
00:17:40,155 --> 00:17:43,702
No! Not that!

146
00:18:07,236 --> 00:18:10,981
Only a pin point,
monsieur Beaumont,

147
00:18:11,001 --> 00:18:15,732
in a glass of wine
or perhaps a flower.

148
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:22,217
Take it.
The time is very brief.

149
00:18:22,385 --> 00:18:25,475
You must do your share if
I am to help you.

150
00:18:28,349 --> 00:18:30,555
Keep it, monsieur.

151
00:18:34,222 --> 00:18:39,743
Keep it.
You may change your mind.

152
00:18:53,551 --> 00:18:57,063
Send me word when you use it.

153
00:19:11,806 --> 00:19:16,258
- I’ll find another way.
- There is no other way.

154
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,392
They are driving away evil spirits!

155
00:19:36,417 --> 00:19:38,854
Close it, close it!

156
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,923
Mademoiselle!

157
00:20:02,228 --> 00:20:05,569
I love you, Madeline, more than
anything else in this whole world, dear.

158
00:20:05,593 --> 00:20:08,696
Heaven or hell lies in this
little moment for me.

159
00:20:08,721 --> 00:20:13,023
You could raise me up to paradise or
you could blast my world into nothingness.

160
00:20:13,082 --> 00:20:16,433
I can make you the envy of every woman.

161
00:20:16,934 --> 00:20:19,303
I’d give my life to make you happy!

162
00:20:21,758 --> 00:20:23,923
Oh, listen to me dear
before it’s too late!

163
00:20:24,413 --> 00:20:26,246
Don’t, please.

164
00:20:26,380 --> 00:20:28,284
Don’t go into that room.

165
00:20:28,359 --> 00:20:30,739
We can be in Port-au-Prince
in half an hour.

166
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:32,940
There’s a boat sailing at midnight.

167
00:20:34,165 --> 00:20:36,418
You’ve been so wonderful.

168
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:38,846
Don’t spoil everything now.

169
00:20:42,723 --> 00:20:45,445
One last gift
before I lose you forever!

170
00:21:29,635 --> 00:21:33,266
We are gathered together here
in the sight of God,

171
00:21:33,365 --> 00:21:35,467
and in the face of this company,

172
00:21:35,866 --> 00:21:38,767
to join together this man, this woman

173
00:21:38,968 --> 00:21:40,768
in holy matrimony.

174
00:23:14,517 --> 00:23:16,308
This is the night of nights!

175
00:23:19,509 --> 00:23:23,193
A toast to the bride!
To beauty’s queen!

176
00:23:25,597 --> 00:23:27,763
Gladly, My Lord!

177
00:23:32,291 --> 00:23:35,573
Leave but a kiss
within the glass.

178
00:23:37,195 --> 00:23:40,718
Fair gypsy, read my fortune.

179
00:23:48,022 --> 00:23:50,273
What do you see in the glass?

180
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:56,249
I see
happiness...

181
00:23:57,215 --> 00:24:03,470
I see love, far more than you
can bear.

182
00:24:03,494 --> 00:24:05,600
Is that all?

183
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,991
No.

184
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:08,784
I see...

185
00:24:16,040 --> 00:24:17,831
I see...

186
00:24:17,855 --> 00:24:18,855
What is it?

187
00:24:20,387 --> 00:24:22,424
I see death.

188
00:24:24,687 --> 00:24:25,687
Madelin!

189
00:24:29,986 --> 00:24:31,324
Madeline, what’s wrong?

190
00:24:32,065 --> 00:24:33,564
Madeline my dear, please.

191
00:24:42,888 --> 00:24:44,951
Oh, no...

192
00:24:48,527 --> 00:24:51,548
Madeline?
Madeline?

193
00:24:53,085 --> 00:24:54,898
Can’t we do something?

194
00:24:54,923 --> 00:24:57,051
Please, please.

195
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,979
Madeline!

196
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,713
Not my wife. My wife!

197
00:25:42,693 --> 00:25:47,170
Praise of our lord and saviour
and the love of god

198
00:25:47,195 --> 00:25:50,091
and the fellowship
of his angels.

199
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:54,074
Be with us ever more. Amen.

200
00:26:38,624 --> 00:26:41,908
Neil, Neil...

201
00:27:14,108 --> 00:27:15,108
Neil...

202
00:27:16,109 --> 00:27:17,109
Neil...

203
00:27:18,881 --> 00:27:21,525
Neil...
Neil...

204
00:28:15,634 --> 00:28:16,634
Look!

205
00:28:28,739 --> 00:28:29,840
Zombies!

206
00:28:31,726 --> 00:28:34,641
Yes.
They are my servants.

207
00:28:35,142 --> 00:28:37,443
Did you think we could do it alone?

208
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:41,148
In their lifetime they were my enemies.

209
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:49,141
Ledot, the witch doctor.
Once my master.

210
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:52,519
Secrets I tortured out of him.

211
00:28:52,543 --> 00:28:55,654
Von Gelder, the swine.
Swollen with riches.

212
00:28:56,154 --> 00:29:02,854
He fought against my spells until the last.
In him I have a struggling type.

213
00:29:04,515 --> 00:29:09,000
His Excellence, Richard.
Once minister of the interior.

214
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:18,265
Scarpia, Brigand Chief.
Marcquis, Captain of Gendarmerie....

215
00:29:19,161 --> 00:29:26,582
And this, this is Chauvin,
the high executioner,

216
00:29:26,607 --> 00:29:29,668
who almost executed me!

217
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,442
I took them

218
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:41,970
just as we will take
this one.

219
00:29:42,028 --> 00:29:44,471
But what if they
regain their souls?

220
00:29:46,499 --> 00:29:49,074
They would tear me to pieces.

221
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:55,052
But that, my friend,
shall never be.

222
00:31:09,288 --> 00:31:10,626
Madeline!

223
00:31:14,384 --> 00:31:16,209
Madeline!

224
00:31:21,655 --> 00:31:23,078
Madeline!

225
00:31:23,256 --> 00:31:24,716
Madeline!

226
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:53,086
There’s two explanations
that strike me,

227
00:32:53,110 --> 00:32:56,312
either the body was stolen by the
members of a death cult

228
00:32:56,336 --> 00:33:01,077
that use human bones in their
ceremonies, or else...

229
00:33:01,253 --> 00:33:02,554
Or else what?

230
00:33:02,653 --> 00:33:04,254
She’s not dead.

231
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,126
Not dead?

232
00:33:10,976 --> 00:33:12,348
Are you mad?

233
00:33:12,373 --> 00:33:15,625
I saw her die,
the doctor signed the certificate.

234
00:33:15,649 --> 00:33:16,931
I saw them bury her.

235
00:33:17,246 --> 00:33:20,762
Now, wait a minute, wait a minute,
I’m not mad.

236
00:33:21,562 --> 00:33:24,818
But I’ve lived in these islands
for a good many years,

237
00:33:24,842 --> 00:33:30,038
and I’ve seen things with my eyes
that made me think I was crazy.

238
00:33:31,125 --> 00:33:35,967
There are superstitions in Haiti that
the natives brought here from Africa.

239
00:33:36,081 --> 00:33:41,684
Some of them can be traced back
as far as ancient Egypt,

240
00:33:41,708 --> 00:33:45,842
and beyond that yet, in the countries
that was old when Egypt was young.

241
00:33:46,141 --> 00:33:48,367
Yes, but what has that
to do with Madeline?

242
00:33:48,391 --> 00:33:50,670
I kissed her as she lay
there in the coffin.

243
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,078
And her lips were cold.

244
00:33:56,076 --> 00:33:59,518
Let me explain.
Now, just a minute, I’ll explain.

245
00:34:00,037 --> 00:34:04,822
Wherever there is a superstition,
you will find there is also a practice.

246
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:06,628
Now, do you remember
what your driver told you

247
00:34:06,652 --> 00:34:08,493
the night that he took you
to Beaumont’s house?

248
00:34:08,716 --> 00:34:11,082
Oh, about those horrible
creatures we saw?

249
00:34:11,482 --> 00:34:14,202
He said they were corpses!
Taken from their graves.

250
00:34:14,226 --> 00:34:17,845
Yes - that’s the superstition!
Now for the practice.

251
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:21,644
The ghouls that steal
the dead corpses from their graves,

252
00:34:21,669 --> 00:34:24,638
are supposed to put them
there in the first place.

253
00:34:25,705 --> 00:34:28,097
Do you mean that
Madeline was murdered

254
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:30,274
so that somebody could
steal her dead body?

255
00:34:30,298 --> 00:34:31,476
Aagh! Nonsense!

256
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:34,295
No, no. Not her...

257
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:37,880
Her body, yes. But not her dead body.
That’s what I meant.

258
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:43,306
Well, surely you don’t think
she’s alive, in the hands of natives?

259
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:45,413
Oh no, better dead than that!

260
00:34:45,524 --> 00:34:48,047
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?

261
00:34:50,581 --> 00:34:51,644
Thank you.

262
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:01,105
You don’t believe that,
do you?

263
00:35:02,373 --> 00:35:07,307
Say, there’s been lots of people
that’s been pronounced dead

264
00:35:07,318 --> 00:35:09,803
that came alive again and
lived for years.

265
00:35:09,827 --> 00:35:13,001
Now, if nature can play
pranks like that,

266
00:35:13,025 --> 00:35:15,942
why isn’t it possible to play
pranks with nature?

267
00:35:15,967 --> 00:35:17,310
Oh, I don’t know.

268
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:25,313
Your driver believed he saw
dead men, walking.

269
00:35:26,316 --> 00:35:30,618
He didn’t. What he saw was men alive

270
00:35:30,642 --> 00:35:32,813
and everything but this and this.

271
00:35:35,518 --> 00:35:38,879
Oh, the whole thing has me confused!

272
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:40,594
I just can’t understand it.

273
00:35:40,821 --> 00:35:43,883
Um, I don’t blame you...
I don’t blame you.

274
00:35:43,907 --> 00:35:46,803
I’ve been trying for years to get to
the bottom of these things.

275
00:35:46,946 --> 00:35:50,071
To separate what
you call fact from fiction.

276
00:35:50,593 --> 00:35:51,824
The law!

277
00:35:52,124 --> 00:35:56,326
The law of Haiti acknowledges
the possibility of being buried alive.

278
00:35:56,527 --> 00:36:00,332
Here it is in the penal code.
I’ll read it for you.

279
00:36:01,629 --> 00:36:03,182
It’s in French,
do you speak French?

280
00:36:03,206 --> 00:36:04,206
No.

281
00:36:05,188 --> 00:36:07,330
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?

282
00:36:07,469 --> 00:36:08,791
Right here, here’s one.

283
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:10,315
Oh, thank you. I didn’t see it there.

284
00:36:10,464 --> 00:36:13,735
I’ll translate it for you.
If you could spare me.

285
00:36:13,925 --> 00:36:15,137
Article...

286
00:36:15,951 --> 00:36:17,737
Article 2.49.

287
00:36:19,140 --> 00:36:23,494
The use...
The use of drugs or other practices

288
00:36:23,518 --> 00:36:28,775
which produce lethargic coma,
or lifeless sleep,

289
00:36:28,799 --> 00:36:32,544
shall be considered attempted murder.

290
00:36:33,307 --> 00:36:33,907
Attempted!

291
00:36:34,057 --> 00:36:35,068
Yes I see.

292
00:36:36,425 --> 00:36:39,428
If the person has been
buried alive,

293
00:36:39,452 --> 00:36:42,753
the act should be considered murder

294
00:36:42,777 --> 00:36:45,113
no matter what result follows.

295
00:36:46,369 --> 00:36:47,647
Beaumont!

296
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:52,549
Say, you said you couldn’t understand
why he was so interested in us.

297
00:36:52,912 --> 00:36:54,617
Do you think he did this?

298
00:36:54,893 --> 00:36:57,152
No. No, I think his natives would.

299
00:36:57,202 --> 00:36:59,302
Natives would be right.

300
00:36:59,352 --> 00:37:02,353
Of course if you want to,
we could go to Beaumont’s house first.

301
00:37:03,851 --> 00:37:09,402
If I could get my hands on the devil
that’s responsible for this,

302
00:37:09,426 --> 00:37:12,777
I’ll make him such an example
that every witch doctor in Haiti

303
00:37:12,802 --> 00:37:14,570
would be shaking in his sandals.

304
00:37:14,594 --> 00:37:17,468
But we can’t do this alone.

305
00:37:17,492 --> 00:37:18,926
Can’t the authorities help?

306
00:37:19,851 --> 00:37:24,564
The authorities, Neil, my boy,
you don’t know these islands.

307
00:37:24,663 --> 00:37:27,314
The native authorities are
afraid to meddle.

308
00:37:27,364 --> 00:37:30,666
I am not. I’ve got friends
among the natives.

309
00:37:31,018 --> 00:37:34,295
They’ll tell me things that no gendarme
could ever get out of them.

310
00:37:35,219 --> 00:37:38,370
Because I am a preacher.

311
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:40,093
They think I am a magician.

312
00:37:42,903 --> 00:37:47,773
Before we get through with this thing,
we may uncover sins

313
00:37:47,798 --> 00:37:51,099
that even the devil
would be ashamed of.

314
00:37:53,613 --> 00:37:56,780
Oh, these witch doctors...

315
00:39:13,868 --> 00:39:14,913
Madeline...

316
00:40:06,529 --> 00:40:12,433
Foolish things, they can’t bring
back the light to those eyes.

317
00:40:15,763 --> 00:40:21,180
I was mad to do this,
but if you had smiled on me,

318
00:40:21,204 --> 00:40:25,238
I’d have done anything for you,
given you anything.

319
00:40:27,329 --> 00:40:34,694
I thought that beauty alone would satisfy,
but the soul is gone...

320
00:40:35,743 --> 00:40:39,444
I can’t bear those
empty staring eyes.

321
00:40:42,628 --> 00:40:45,447
Oh, forgive me, Madeline.
Forgive me!

322
00:40:47,312 --> 00:40:51,801
I can’t bear it any longer,
I must take you back.

323
00:40:54,613 --> 00:40:58,053
Back to the grave,
Monsieur?

324
00:40:59,921 --> 00:41:06,356
No, you must put the life back into her
eyes and bring laughter to her lips.

325
00:41:07,026 --> 00:41:09,359
She must be gay and
happy again!

326
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:12,805
You paint a charming picture,
Monsieur.

327
00:41:13,076 --> 00:41:16,459
One that I should
like to see myself!

328
00:41:38,561 --> 00:41:40,490
You must bring her back.

329
00:41:40,966 --> 00:41:44,350
Aren’t you a trifle afraid,
Monsieur?

330
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:48,738
How do suppose those
eyes will regard you

331
00:41:48,762 --> 00:41:51,413
when the brain is able
to understand?

332
00:42:24,637 --> 00:42:29,332
Better to see hatred in them
than that dreadful emptiness.

333
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:31,692
Perhaps you’re right.

334
00:42:32,191 --> 00:42:36,009
It would be a pity to destroy
such a lovely flower.

335
00:42:38,451 --> 00:42:41,696
Let’s drink to the future
of this flower.

336
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:42,720
A glass of wine!

337
00:42:45,288 --> 00:42:49,855
Silver, bring wine!
We have a toast to drink.

338
00:43:17,939 --> 00:43:20,813
To the future,
Monsieur!

339
00:43:36,247 --> 00:43:41,505
Only a pin point,
Monsieur.

340
00:43:41,529 --> 00:43:42,735
In a flower...

341
00:43:43,473 --> 00:43:47,223
or perhaps in a glass of wine?

342
00:43:56,044 --> 00:43:58,548
You devil!
What are you trying to do to me?

343
00:43:59,088 --> 00:44:02,716
I have other plans
for Mademoiselle.

344
00:44:02,740 --> 00:44:06,263
And I am afraid you might not agree.

345
00:44:10,417 --> 00:44:15,242
I have taken a fancy to you,
Monsieur!

346
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:18,763
Silver! Silver!

347
00:45:26,565 --> 00:45:28,065
Don’t, don’t!

348
00:45:59,008 --> 00:46:01,519
To the future,
Monsieur!

349
00:46:27,813 --> 00:46:30,605
The vulture,
you...

350
00:46:39,896 --> 00:46:44,603
No. Not that.
Not that!

351
00:46:50,433 --> 00:46:53,039
We ought to be picking up an old witch
doctor around here pretty soon.

352
00:46:53,063 --> 00:46:57,151
His name is Pierre, I’ve known
him for years. Bright old fellow.

353
00:46:57,175 --> 00:47:00,946
I don’t know just
where we’ll find him.

354
00:47:21,431 --> 00:47:27,541
Come, son.
There are evil spirits in the road.

355
00:47:27,945 --> 00:47:35,945
I will give you an awonga.
And here, this one for the ox.

356
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:51,526
Young man is sick with distress.

357
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,973
Well hey, wait a minute, we can’t
afford to have you sick.

358
00:47:56,299 --> 00:48:00,168
Neil, why don’t you go over there,
we've got a hard day before us tomorrow.

359
00:48:02,632 --> 00:48:07,836
Now, now then Pierre, come on.
He’s gone. We can talk.

360
00:48:07,861 --> 00:48:11,382
It is a dangerous thing
you ask me to do.

361
00:48:11,407 --> 00:48:15,149
Well now listen here you know,
we're old friends, you and me,

362
00:48:15,174 --> 00:48:16,790
and I want to go on.

363
00:48:16,814 --> 00:48:20,115
Turn back before it is too late!

364
00:48:20,638 --> 00:48:23,063
Oh, no. I’ve come too
far to turn back now.

365
00:48:23,351 --> 00:48:27,736
I’m too old to go all this way with you.

366
00:48:27,891 --> 00:48:32,042
Well listen, can’t you get somebody
to go with us?

367
00:48:32,237 --> 00:48:36,544
My people all afraid of the mountain.

368
00:48:36,569 --> 00:48:37,654
Why?

369
00:48:38,054 --> 00:48:44,648
Because it is called
the land of the living dead.

370
00:48:44,852 --> 00:48:48,278
Well, have, have you ever been there?

371
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:55,838
I am the only man that has ever
come back from there alive.

372
00:48:58,508 --> 00:49:06,158
There is an evil spirit man
that is called Murder.

373
00:49:06,183 --> 00:49:12,559
Come, I will tell you all about
what he did.

374
00:50:06,556 --> 00:50:07,557
Vulture.

375
00:50:18,683 --> 00:50:20,657
Just as old Pierre said.

376
00:50:21,961 --> 00:50:27,391
A cloud of vultures always hovers
over the house of the living dead.

377
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:30,616
Madeline...

378
00:50:31,468 --> 00:50:33,005
Is she there?

379
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,269
Oh, I must go and see her.

380
00:50:35,294 --> 00:50:42,304
Neil, my boy, please, please
lie down and rest. Please.

381
00:50:43,963 --> 00:50:46,210
You’ll feel stronger
in the morning.

382
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,600
You rest.

383
00:50:52,612 --> 00:50:55,337
Let me go up
and see what I can do.

384
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,823
Why is she so restless tonight?

385
00:51:21,876 --> 00:51:24,556
Perhaps she remembers something?

386
00:51:25,936 --> 00:51:30,751
They never remember anything
when they are like that.

387
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:31,832
No?

388
00:51:32,615 --> 00:51:36,553
Because she’s cut off.

389
00:52:22,164 --> 00:52:23,164
Madeline!

390
00:52:24,697 --> 00:52:25,697
Madeline!

391
00:53:03,661 --> 00:53:05,525
No, no, I can’t,

392
00:53:05,549 --> 00:53:06,638
I can’t!

393
00:53:06,662 --> 00:53:09,977
You must, it’s your turn.

394
00:53:10,001 --> 00:53:11,001
Let’s run away!

395
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:15,589
He might hear you!

396
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:19,901
No way. I can’t stand it.
I am going to run away!

397
00:53:20,989 --> 00:53:24,403
He will find you
and make you like her.

398
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,630
Can you still hear me?

399
00:54:46,659 --> 00:54:50,240
It is unfortunate you are
no longer able to speak.

400
00:54:51,940 --> 00:54:55,436
I should be interested to hear
you describe your symptoms...

401
00:55:07,141 --> 00:55:13,544
You see, you are the first man
to know what is happening.

402
00:55:18,288 --> 00:55:22,348
None of the others
did.

403
00:55:43,374 --> 00:55:46,984
You refused to shake hands once.

404
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:49,109
I remember.

405
00:55:50,940 --> 00:55:52,060
Well, well.

406
00:55:53,349 --> 00:55:55,811
We understand each other better now.

407
01:01:57,343 --> 01:01:58,764
Madeline!

408
01:02:04,611 --> 01:02:06,060
Madeline!

409
01:02:29,531 --> 01:02:30,827
Madeline!

410
01:02:33,745 --> 01:02:37,060
Madeline!
I found you!

411
01:02:37,084 --> 01:02:39,696
You’re alive.
Alive!

412
01:02:40,627 --> 01:02:44,132
What’s the matter?
It’s I, Neil.

413
01:02:55,033 --> 01:02:59,439
Oh my darling,
what have they done to you?

414
01:03:19,397 --> 01:03:21,056
Who are you?

415
01:03:23,552 --> 01:03:24,928
And what are they?

416
01:03:25,092 --> 01:03:28,553
For you, my friend,
they are the angels of death.

417
01:04:04,026 --> 01:04:07,501
Come! Zombies!
Duck!

418
01:04:27,218 --> 01:04:28,375
Look!

419
01:05:16,527 --> 01:05:20,390
Madeline, don’t you know me,
dear?

420
01:05:20,704 --> 01:05:22,042
It’s Neil.

421
01:05:22,370 --> 01:05:26,900
I could swear, for a moment
she recognized you.

422
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:31,902
Come on, don’t let
him get away!

423
01:06:29,504 --> 01:06:32,327
Madeline, my darling!

424
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:46,810
Neil, I...
I dreamed?

425
01:06:52,693 --> 01:06:58,058
Excuse me please,
have you got a match?

426
