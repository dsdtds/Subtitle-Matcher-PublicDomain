2
00:03:50,305 --> 00:03:54,582
At the next intersection,
why don't you turn south?

3
00:03:54,622 --> 00:04:01,613
Chocolate Mountains were east last
time we headed that way. Who needs
the mountains? Head for San Felipe.

4
00:04:01,653 --> 00:04:06,166
There's nothing to do in San Felipe
but fish. Well. . .

5
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,964
That was the idea, wasn't it?

6
00:04:08,965 --> 00:04:11,241
Yeah, I guess so.

7
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:15,159
We might just pick up a drink
in Mexicale.

8
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:19,596
Remember Floribel
at the Alhambra Club? Yeah.

9
00:04:21,113 --> 00:04:26,786
She's probably dead by now. It was a
long time ago. Yeah. Poor Floribel.

10
00:04:26,826 --> 00:04:31,906
Well, there's no harm
in drinking a toast to her. OK.

11
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:39,570
Except for the war, this is my first
time away from Maudie and the kids.

12
00:04:39,610 --> 00:04:44,486
D'you wanna turn back?
No, no. We've come this far.

13
00:04:44,526 --> 00:04:47,364
Mexicale's beginning to sound good.

14
00:04:55,957 --> 00:04:58,437
Guess maybes.

15
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:04,276
I remember that joint.

16
00:05:32,278 --> 00:05:36,672
Bienvenidos, cavallieros!
Bienvenidos a Mexico. . .

17
00:05:36,712 --> 00:05:43,506
This is the place, senors, come in.
Juanita's starting her famous
fan dance. You're just in time.

18
00:05:43,546 --> 00:05:47,340
We might as well take a look.
. .Hey, Gil. Gil?

19
00:05:49,618 --> 00:05:52,178
Sorry, friend, no sale.

20
00:05:59,045 --> 00:06:02,526
Oh, well. San Felipe, here we come.

21
00:06:21,185 --> 00:06:23,665
Out of gas? Yeah. Hop in.

22
00:06:31,372 --> 00:06:37,724
We're going to San Felipe.
You can pick up gas there
and hitch a ride back.

23
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,648
Waiting out there long? Yeah.

24
00:06:44,357 --> 00:06:47,201
Light me a cigarette, will you?

25
00:06:49,995 --> 00:06:51,553
Smoke?

26
00:06:52,992 --> 00:06:54,750
No.

27
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,355
What are you doing, rolling 'em?

28
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:02,551
Face front.

29
00:07:04,177 --> 00:07:06,975
And keep driving.

30
00:07:08,171 --> 00:07:10,651
Sure, I'm Emmet Myers.

31
00:07:11,728 --> 00:07:18,167
Do what I tell you. . .and
no fast moves. A lot of dead heroes
back there got nervous.

32
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,476
From now on, when you're driving,
keep both hands high on that wheel.

33
00:07:24,516 --> 00:07:27,993
You, keep one hand
on the top of this seat,

34
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:31,030
the other hand high on that window.

35
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:36,275
All right. Now turn off
the next side road we come to.

36
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:49,135
Pull up.

37
00:07:52,844 --> 00:07:55,529
Open the glove compartment.

38
00:08:01,438 --> 00:08:03,554
What's the box?

39
00:08:03,594 --> 00:08:06,478
Cartridges, 22s. Give 'em to me.

40
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:13,274
Close it.

41
00:08:17,419 --> 00:08:22,345
Now this is how we get out
after this. First, give me the keys.

42
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:30,611
Stand away from the car. Then you.

43
00:08:33,642 --> 00:08:36,247
Let's go.

44
00:08:42,994 --> 00:08:46,907
Drop your jackets
around your elbows.

45
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,428
Turn around.

46
00:08:58,893 --> 00:09:01,692
We're gonna open the trunk.

47
00:09:01,732 --> 00:09:03,330
Move.

48
00:09:08,284 --> 00:09:10,844
Pull your jackets up.

49
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:16,477
You, open the trunk.

50
00:09:16,517 --> 00:09:20,117
Both of you,
keep your hands on the lid.

51
00:09:22,192 --> 00:09:24,668
Throw me the keys.

52
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,785
Now get the blankets.

53
00:09:27,825 --> 00:09:32,301
You'd never make it!
Get the groceries.

54
00:09:36,414 --> 00:09:41,409
Whose gun is that? Mine.
Do you like to shoot? Yeah.

55
00:09:41,449 --> 00:09:46,525
So do I. So I'm warning you,
don't try anything smart with me.

56
00:09:46,565 --> 00:09:48,447
Move!

57
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:34,755
I told you my name. What's yours?

58
00:10:34,795 --> 00:10:39,308
Mine's Gilbert Bowen.
He's Roy Collins.

59
00:10:39,348 --> 00:10:42,186
What do you do for a living?

60
00:10:42,226 --> 00:10:45,142
I'm a draughtsman. He runs a garage.

61
00:10:45,182 --> 00:10:47,978
That makes you smarter.

62
00:10:48,018 --> 00:10:50,344
Or does it?

63
00:10:51,454 --> 00:10:57,368
CLICK
You're lucky. It hit an empty
chamber. I used it a while back.

64
00:10:57,408 --> 00:11:01,725
No fast moves!
The last guy made that mistake.

65
00:11:31,452 --> 00:11:34,129
When are you due back?

66
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:40,161
No particular time. We told our
wives to expect us when we got there.

67
00:11:40,201 --> 00:11:43,480
You got wives, huh? Any kids?

68
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,634
I have. Just keep thinking
how nice it'll be to see 'em again.

69
00:11:53,588 --> 00:11:57,426
There's a checkpoint. Slow down.
No talking.

70
00:11:57,466 --> 00:12:00,145
If I give you the word, step on it.

71
00:12:27,953 --> 00:12:30,589
This car rides pretty good.

72
00:12:30,629 --> 00:12:35,424
When I get where I'm going,
I think I'll sell it.

73
00:12:35,464 --> 00:12:38,221
Where are we going?

74
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:42,975
Pull in at the next pump.
We'll fill up and get a road map.

75
00:12:43,015 --> 00:12:45,451
I got an idea. . .

76
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:48,215
a pretty good one.

77
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,508
Aqui estas, senor. Gracias.

78
00:13:09,548 --> 00:13:14,502
Speak English. He doesn't understand
English. I don't understand Mexican.

79
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:17,063
Leave the change. Let's go.

80
00:13:20,892 --> 00:13:22,496
Loco!

81
00:13:26,051 --> 00:13:28,770
Gimme the map.

82
00:13:42,633 --> 00:13:45,591
Take the first side road we come to.

83
00:14:04,326 --> 00:14:06,533
Pull up.

84
00:14:09,963 --> 00:14:11,960
Keys.

85
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,522
All right,
now get out like I told you.

86
00:14:19,954 --> 00:14:24,675
Here, you're the smart guy.
Spread the map out on the hood.

87
00:14:29,422 --> 00:14:34,416
Get your hands up on the car. Look
for a town called Santa Rosalia.

88
00:14:37,893 --> 00:14:40,410
How far is it?

89
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:47,242
About 500 miles. Is it on the Gulf
of California? Yeah. Does it talk
about a ferry across the Gulf?

90
00:14:47,282 --> 00:14:48,766
Friday.

91
00:14:49,962 --> 00:14:51,998
Not bad.

92
00:14:52,038 --> 00:14:54,795
We're loaded with time.

93
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:57,514
We can make that easy.

94
00:15:00,549 --> 00:15:04,792
After that,
I won't need you guys any more.

95
00:15:06,503 --> 00:15:10,615
I guess we won't be having rabbit
for dinner.

96
00:15:10,655 --> 00:15:13,300
I wasn't trying.

97
00:15:20,765 --> 00:15:22,284
Collins.

98
00:15:22,324 --> 00:15:25,048
Put the can out on that rock there.

99
00:15:28,877 --> 00:15:31,277
Gimme the map.

100
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:42,231
Not that one! The other one.

101
00:15:44,579 --> 00:15:47,096
That's it.

102
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:53,535
All right, Collins.
Put the can back on the rock.

103
00:15:58,127 --> 00:16:03,929
Don't forget, this is loaded too.
You try. Let's see how good you are.

104
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:11,431
Go ahead.

105
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,627
Not bad.

106
00:16:19,667 --> 00:16:21,581
Collins.

107
00:16:21,621 --> 00:16:23,947
Pick up the can.

108
00:16:26,975 --> 00:16:29,811
Take it onto that point there.

109
00:16:29,851 --> 00:16:33,649
If you don't,
I'll let Bowen have it.

110
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:36,485
Onto the point, that's right.

111
00:16:36,525 --> 00:16:38,771
Further.

112
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,473
Now hold it up. You won't get hurt,
your buddy's good with guns.

113
00:16:47,513 --> 00:16:52,391
You're crazy! I won't do it.
It'sjust a game. Go ahead.

114
00:16:52,431 --> 00:16:55,315
Collins, hold it closer to you.

115
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:00,819
What's the matter, are you scared?
Hold it closer.

116
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:04,186
You want me to try?
I might miss this time.

117
00:17:09,770 --> 00:17:11,613
Shoot.

118
00:17:37,739 --> 00:17:40,583
Come on Gil, get going.

119
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:50,688
Nervous? Relax.

120
00:17:52,044 --> 00:17:55,042
All right, Collins, come on in.

121
00:17:55,082 --> 00:17:56,964
Fun's over.

122
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:01,122
You guys worked up quite a sweat.

123
00:18:26,727 --> 00:18:28,285
Collins.

124
00:18:29,445 --> 00:18:35,117
Collins! What do you want?
Turn on the radio. Why bother?

125
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:40,077
All you get is Mexican commercials.
Never mind. . .Turn it on.

126
00:18:49,346 --> 00:18:54,340
Get something else. Like what? One
of those news guys from the States.

127

Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
Sam Hayes reporting.

Hitch-hike murderer, Emmet Myers,
is still at large. Yesterday,
the devil thumbed another ride

141
00:20:10,454 --> 00:20:17,288
and William Johnson of Portland asked
him to hop in. Now, he is dead. In

Out.

149
00:21:17,982 --> 00:21:19,381
Move.

150

Each of you take one.

151
00:21:34,407 --> 00:21:37,012
Get around the car.

I know what you're thinking,
Collins.

154
00:21:54,744 --> 00:21:57,389
You haven't got a chance.

155
00:21:59,378 --> 00:22:04,615
You guys are gonna die, that's all.
It's just a question of when.

156
00:22:04,655 --> 00:22:08,729
Santa Rosalia,
that's the end of the line.

157
00:22:08,769 --> 00:22:11,927
If the cops find out we're together

158
00:22:11,967 --> 00:22:14,646
or if you try to cross me up. . .

159
00:22:22,518 --> 00:22:27,399
You know, you make pretty good
targets from where I sit.

160
00:22:27,511 --> 00:22:32,107
Anyway, you couldn't tell
if I was awake or asleep.

161
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:36,059
I've one bum eye.

162
00:22:36,099 --> 00:22:39,017
It won't stay closed.

163
00:22:39,057 --> 00:22:41,463
Pretty good, huh?

164
00:23:45,945 --> 00:23:51,341
We're getting out here and buy
some grub. We get out like usual.

165
00:23:51,381 --> 00:23:56,894
You guys go in the store ahead of
me. No Mexican. I'm talking to you.

166
00:23:56,934 --> 00:24:01,010
When he tells you how much, you pay.
Is that clear?

167
00:24:01,050 --> 00:24:08,045
One other thing. I'll have my hand
in my pocket. So far, my record in
Mexico's clean. Let's keep it clean.

168
00:24:08,085 --> 00:24:10,013
Let's go.

169
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:20,673
Buenos dias, senores.

170
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:36,693
Buenos dias, senores. Provisiones?

171
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:46,443
. .in Tijuana. What did he say
about Tijuana? He said their prices
are about the same as in Tijuana.

172
00:24:46,483 --> 00:24:49,160
Never mind the kid.

173
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:55,754
What do you want?
Some beans and stuff. And tomato
soup. I like that. Get four cans.

174
00:24:55,794 --> 00:25:00,748
He wants four cans of beans and
tomato soup, three cans of chilli.

175
00:25:01,829 --> 00:25:08,780
It's no use. He doesn't understand
English. You're not talking Mexican.
Take the cans. Give them to Collins.

176
00:25:22,605 --> 00:25:25,483
I can take some more.

177
00:25:30,116 --> 00:25:33,005
Go on, load it up.

178
00:25:34,472 --> 00:25:37,191
That'll hold us. Pay him.

179
00:25:38,310 --> 00:25:41,666
Quince pesos, diez centavos, senor.

180
00:25:50,932 --> 00:25:53,812
Deme una manzana. Deme una manzana.

181
00:25:53,852 --> 00:25:57,054
Deme una manzana.

182
00:25:58,846 --> 00:26:01,690
Get her away from me.

183
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:09,556
Put the kid down. Let's get outta
here. Come on, Collins.
Muchas gracias.

184
00:26:12,952 --> 00:26:15,825
Vaya usted con Dios.

185
00:26:15,865 --> 00:26:20,703
What did you say? You wouldn't
understand. What did you say?

186
00:26:20,743 --> 00:26:24,104
I said,
"Go you with God, little one."

187
00:26:41,882 --> 00:26:43,918
Get in.

188
00:26:45,315 --> 00:26:47,273
Hey, mister.

189
00:26:47,313 --> 00:26:52,154
You live in El Centro. I live there
some time. Nice place, huh?

190
00:28:03,036 --> 00:28:06,072
Where'd you get the watch, Bowen?

191
00:28:06,112 --> 00:28:08,746
My wife gave it to me.

192
00:28:08,786 --> 00:28:11,271
Throw it over here.

193
00:28:15,338 --> 00:28:19,900
Didn't you hear me?
I told you to throw it over here.

194
00:28:37,077 --> 00:28:41,273
I had a watch like this once,
when I was 17.

195
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:43,950
Nobody gave it to me.

196
00:28:43,990 --> 00:28:46,266
I took it.

197
00:28:46,306 --> 00:28:51,542
I knocked off a broken-down
jewellery store outside of Tulsa.

198
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:53,703
It was a cinch.

199
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:58,334
You guys are soft.

200
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:04,647
You know what makes you that way?

201
00:29:04,687 --> 00:29:07,564
You're up to your necks in IOUs.

202
00:29:07,604 --> 00:29:10,442
You're suckers.

203
00:29:10,482 --> 00:29:14,959
You're scared to get out
on your own.

204
00:29:14,999 --> 00:29:19,272
You always had it good,
so you're soft.

205
00:29:19,312 --> 00:29:21,467
Well, not me.

206
00:29:22,827 --> 00:29:25,583
Nobody ever gave me anything.

207
00:29:25,623 --> 00:29:28,302
So I don't owe nobody.

208
00:29:30,140 --> 00:29:32,897
My folks were duff.

209
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:39,091
When I was born, they took
one look at this. . .puss of mine
and told me to get lost.

210
00:29:39,131 --> 00:29:43,245
I didn't need 'em.
I didn't need any of em.

211
00:29:43,285 --> 00:29:46,203
I got what I wanted my own way.

212
00:29:47,443 --> 00:29:54,360
When you get the know-how
and a few bucks in your pocket,
you can buy anything or anybody.

213
00:29:55,557 --> 00:30:00,597
Especially if they're at the point
of a gun. That really scares 'em.

214
00:30:01,869 --> 00:30:05,942
You ever been
at the other end of a gun? No.

215
00:30:05,982 --> 00:30:07,898
And I never will be.

216
00:30:12,576 --> 00:30:15,579
I'm gonna listen to the news.

217
00:30:30,478 --> 00:30:37,316
Turn it up. We'd like to hear. You
just get the grub ready. Anything
interesting, I'll let you know.

218
00:30:38,946 --> 00:30:43,900
We've got to raise the hood and
put that radio out of commission.

219
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:48,697
When he finds out they're looking
for us together, we're through.

220
00:30:48,737 --> 00:30:53,370
Never mind the radio. We gotta get
HIM. You can't beat him that way.

221
00:30:53,410 --> 00:30:58,246
Give him one good reason and he'll
kill us. We gotta take the chance.

222
00:30:58,286 --> 00:31:04,519
As long as he needs us, we'll stay
alive. When he's ready to jump us,
we'll jump him. Not before.

223
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:07,277
Maybe today, maybe tomorrow.

224
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:12,202
All right, now.

225
00:31:14,947 --> 00:31:17,791
They've found Johnson's car.

226
00:31:21,182 --> 00:31:23,787
They know I'm in Mexico.

227
00:31:25,536 --> 00:31:30,852
And they're looking for you, too,
in the Chocolate Mountains.

228
00:31:30,892 --> 00:31:33,013
Where are the Chocolate Mountains?

229
00:31:34,288 --> 00:31:38,327
In Arizona, near home.
Not in Mexico? No.

230
00:31:40,681 --> 00:31:43,684
Well, what d'you know?

231
00:31:45,118 --> 00:31:50,750
That's where you told your wives you
were going? Then you came to Mexico.

232
00:31:51,829 --> 00:31:53,946
What for?

233
00:31:53,986 --> 00:31:55,584
Dames?

234
00:31:56,824 --> 00:32:00,501
You boys should be ashamed
of yourselves.

235
00:32:00,541 --> 00:32:02,937
Causing all that trouble.

236
00:32:02,977 --> 00:32:04,985
Telling lies.

237
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:10,293
You've got everybody looking for you
in them mountains.

238
00:32:23,116 --> 00:32:26,834
I told you, turn the radio on.
I did.

239
00:32:26,874 --> 00:32:29,428
It takes time to warm up.

240
00:32:30,548 --> 00:32:33,153
Try another station.

241
00:32:34,742 --> 00:32:41,215
Stop it. Stop it! I can't. I gotta
pull up and disconnect it. Pull up!

242
00:32:52,564 --> 00:32:55,123
Raise the hood.

243
00:32:55,163 --> 00:32:57,842
Keep your hands on it.

244
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:01,878
Come on, Collins, get to work.

245
00:33:01,918 --> 00:33:04,756
Get the right one the first time.

246
00:33:05,795 --> 00:33:08,116
Don't pull the radio wire!

247
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:19,255
Faster!
I thought you were a mechanic.

248
00:33:19,295 --> 00:33:22,418
I'm going as fast as I can.

249
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:35,321
Watch it.

250
00:33:53,098 --> 00:33:54,827
Come on.

251
00:33:59,012 --> 00:34:01,936
Throw the tools in the back.

252
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,796
The radio, remember? Make it work.

253
00:34:22,869 --> 00:34:25,235
I can't.

254
00:34:26,342 --> 00:34:27,946
Pull up.

255
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:33,178
So you did bust it, Collins.

256
00:34:34,734 --> 00:34:39,290
Cut it out! He didn't do it.
It's the static in the hills.

257
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:45,889
The stations aren't strong enough
in the daytime. Tonight it'll work.
It'd better. Take the wheel.

258
00:34:47,562 --> 00:34:50,599
Now, in Punta Prieta,

259
00:34:50,639 --> 00:34:56,869
on August 7th, three Americans
stopped for provisions at a store
owned by Jose Andrare.

260
00:34:56,909 --> 00:35:00,948
Andrare gave a description of Myers
as being one of them.

261
00:35:00,988 --> 00:35:05,142
Another witness stated
that three men left the store

262
00:35:05,182 --> 00:35:09,217
and drove away in a green sedan
bearing the same plates.

263
00:35:09,257 --> 00:35:16,492
This confirms our theory that Collins
and Bowen are with him. He seems to
be heading south, avoiding highways.

264
00:35:16,532 --> 00:35:23,164
Exactly. To the west,
this is more or less barren
and would afford no means of escape.

265
00:35:23,204 --> 00:35:27,840
His most logical move
would be Santa Rosalia.

266
00:35:27,880 --> 00:35:30,923
Then Guaymas.

267
00:35:33,151 --> 00:35:37,713
Make sure that fire's out.
Pour the coffee on it.

268
00:35:38,986 --> 00:35:41,068
Get down!

269
00:35:49,734 --> 00:35:54,210
I've gotta get a closer look
at that car. On your feet.

270
00:35:54,250 --> 00:35:58,488
Through there. At the other end,
lie flat. Get going!

271
00:36:32,052 --> 00:36:37,365
Get a move on! Are you trying
to wreck it? Drive like I tell you.

272
00:36:57,022 --> 00:36:58,819
Out!

273
00:37:03,175 --> 00:37:07,691
What did I tell you? Shut up!
Get that spare tyre out. Move!

274
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:31,790
Keep working. Keep your traps shut,
no matter what. I'll be watching.

275
00:37:43,452 --> 00:37:46,012
Buenos dias, senores.

276
00:37:46,052 --> 00:37:49,413
Son Americanos? Do you need any help?

277
00:38:00,677 --> 00:38:07,788
The search for Gilbert Bowen and Roy
Collins, believed to have been last
seen with Emmet Myers, mass killer,

278
00:38:07,828 --> 00:38:14,939
'is being stepped up. Helicopters
are scouring the area from El Centro
south to the Gulf of California.

279
00:38:14,979 --> 00:38:21,412
'Planes are maintaining
close liaison with the ground,
reporting isolated cars and campers.

280
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:26,896
'The Mexican police have now joined
this strange race against death.'

281
00:40:40,504 --> 00:40:43,189
Hold it right there.

282
00:40:46,257 --> 00:40:47,827
Around.

283
00:40:58,446 --> 00:41:00,926
Break the lock.

284
00:41:23,338 --> 00:41:25,863
OK, one of you on the pump.

285
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:17,846
"Maudie and Gilbert Bowen."

286
00:42:23,312 --> 00:42:25,709
Si, si, pronto.

287
00:42:25,749 --> 00:42:30,745
Now, as you will notice,
when interrogated at the road block,

288
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:35,661
the man and his wife were definite
that they only saw two men.

289
00:42:35,701 --> 00:42:40,098
There is a point, however,
which we feel is of importance.

290
00:42:40,138 --> 00:42:46,569
The couple said the behaviour
of the men seemed strange.
They refused to talk to them.

291
00:42:46,609 --> 00:42:51,885
It's possible that Myers my have been
concealed nearby, covering them.

292
00:42:51,925 --> 00:42:54,442
We'll consider that possibility.

293
00:42:54,482 --> 00:43:01,034
Now, on the assumption that Myers
is listening to the radio,
we're issuing these broadcasts,

294
00:43:01,074 --> 00:43:07,758
containing false information as to
his whereabouts and not connecting
the two men with him.

295
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,484
This ought to be the main highway.
It isn't. What do you mean?

296
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:36,719
Looks like an abandoned airstrip.
It's OK for tonight. Go over there.

297
00:43:43,150 --> 00:43:49,703
No, you're wrong! It's no use
trying to talk me out of it. Tonight
I'm gonna chance it. You're mad!

298
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:54,217
I've played it your way long enough.
We've got to stick together.

299
00:43:54,257 --> 00:43:56,822
You do whatever you want. . .

300
00:45:45,299 --> 00:45:48,257
Across the runway, there's trees.

301
00:45:57,246 --> 00:45:59,453
Keep going.

302
00:46:14,789 --> 00:46:17,426
You guys are really dumb.

303
00:46:17,466 --> 00:46:19,951
Why, you dirty. . .

304
00:46:22,620 --> 00:46:25,337
You thought I was asleep, huh?

305
00:46:25,377 --> 00:46:29,740
You're beginning to get ideas. . .
I don't like that.

306
00:46:30,812 --> 00:46:33,648
Load him in the car.

307
00:46:33,688 --> 00:46:37,414
Your buddy's all washed up
for tonight.

308
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,328
Over there.

309
00:47:20,795 --> 00:47:22,160
Move!

310
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:39,858
You, Collins,
throw a rock down that shaft.

311
00:47:50,167 --> 00:47:54,012
Nice and deep.

312
00:48:03,590 --> 00:48:10,423
This is fine. Cut it out! If you're
gonna kill us, do it. I thought
you never killed without a reason.

313
00:48:10,463 --> 00:48:17,499
Go get the rest of the canned goods
out of the car.
We'll have a real good meal.

314
00:48:57,097 --> 00:49:01,136
Save 'em for the next guy
that picks you up.

315
00:49:02,208 --> 00:49:04,647
Anything you say.

316
00:49:04,687 --> 00:49:11,439
'We interrupt this hour of music
to bring you a flash bulletin. The
police have abandoned their theory

317
00:49:11,479 --> 00:49:17,470
'that Emmet Myers
is connected with the disappearance
of Gilbert Bowen and Roy Collins.

318
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:22,306
'They have been missing since last
Sunday, supposedly on a fishing trip.

319
00:49:22,346 --> 00:49:29,501
'The police now feel that Myers
is travelling alone and has abandoned
his intention of seeking escape

320
00:49:29,541 --> 00:49:31,901
'by way of Santa Rosalia.'

321
00:49:37,933 --> 00:49:42,449
What d'you know? !
This kind of changes my plan.

322
00:49:43,848 --> 00:49:48,000
Looks like you and me
are going fishing after all.

323
00:49:49,119 --> 00:49:52,759
On your feet. Back to the car.
Let's go.

324
00:49:55,395 --> 00:49:58,271
We're not going anyplace.

325
00:49:58,311 --> 00:49:59,875
Stand up!

326
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:12,947
What did you do to it? There's
a big hole in that crankcase.

327
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:20,814
All right, we'll walk.

328
00:50:22,844 --> 00:50:27,599
Just what that sore ankle of yours
needs - a nice, long hike.

329
00:50:32,993 --> 00:50:34,790
Get up!

330
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:43,743
Now get the fishing gear
out of the back. Move!

331
00:51:14,911 --> 00:51:19,705
Stay with it. He'll never leave you
out here alive. Yeah.

332
00:51:19,745 --> 00:51:21,912
Cut the gab.

333
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,217
Get down!

334
00:51:46,277 --> 00:51:48,313
Let's get going.

335
00:51:54,470 --> 00:51:58,873
Maybe we'll have to leave you here.
Too bad(!)

336
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:04,940
Come on, Roy, try.

337
00:53:04,713 --> 00:53:07,869
Here we are! Here we are!

338
00:53:07,909 --> 00:53:10,474
Can't you see us?

339
00:53:11,506 --> 00:53:15,660
Look! Here we are! Down here.

340
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:20,498
Oh, please, God! Hear me!

341
00:53:20,538 --> 00:53:22,815
Hear me!

342
00:53:22,855 --> 00:53:25,453
Come back!

343
00:53:25,493 --> 00:53:27,853
Come back.

344
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,444
Leave him alone.
Can't you see he's praying?

345
00:54:46,003 --> 00:54:48,847
Get under the bridge, quick!

346
00:55:11,578 --> 00:55:13,296
Relax.

347
00:55:34,155 --> 00:55:36,874
Go ahead if you can stand the stuff.

348
00:55:52,097 --> 00:55:56,730
You know, Collins?
You're just about my size.

349
00:55:56,770 --> 00:56:02,487
Put you in a black shirt and dark
pants. . .with a leather jacket. . .

350
00:56:03,923 --> 00:56:06,919
. .you'd look just like Emmet Myers

351
00:56:06,959 --> 00:56:09,557
to anyone who never saw him.

352
00:56:09,597 --> 00:56:12,879
Nobody in Santa Rosalia
ever saw him.

353
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:17,076
Let's change.

354
00:56:20,306 --> 00:56:25,744
COCKS RIFLE
Get up on the bank
and take your clothes off.

355
00:56:45,079 --> 00:56:47,684
Come on, get up!

356
00:58:02,155 --> 00:58:04,953
Looks great, doesn't it?

357
00:58:04,993 --> 00:58:11,825
You won't be there long. Collins!
There are cops down there. In
those clothes, they might shoot you.

358
00:58:11,865 --> 00:58:18,181
That'd solve your problems,
wouldn't it? Not if they found
they'd made a mistake.

359
00:58:18,221 --> 00:58:23,213
We'll hit a joint on the outskirts.
I might even buy you boys a beer.

360
00:58:23,253 --> 00:58:25,340
Get moving.

361
00:58:31,766 --> 00:58:36,439
Buenos tardes, senores.
Buenos tardes. Give us three beers.

362
00:58:36,479 --> 00:58:39,076
No hablo ingles.

363
00:58:39,116 --> 00:58:42,510
He doesn't speak English.

364
00:58:42,550 --> 00:58:45,391
Tres cervezas. Si, si.

365
00:58:45,431 --> 00:58:51,148
You can talk Mex when I say. Sit
down, Collins. Rest your sore foot.

366
00:58:54,379 --> 00:58:58,215
You can talk it now.
Ask about the ferry to Guaymas.

367
00:58:58,255 --> 00:59:02,697
I'll be watching his face.
If he looks frightened, I shoot.

368
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:16,602
Friday - that's today - and Tuesday,
9 o'clock. Ask where we catch it.

369
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:31,423
You're out of luck. The ferry burned
up. It's being repaired in Guaymas.

370
00:59:32,540 --> 00:59:34,856
You're lying.

371
00:59:34,896 --> 00:59:38,974
Ask if he knows anyone
who speaks English.

372
00:59:48,043 --> 00:59:52,277
He says his cousin speaks English.
Follow him. Up.

373
00:59:52,317 --> 00:59:53,483
Jose!

374
00:59:57,153 --> 00:59:59,519
Jose, Jose.

375
01:00:12,616 --> 01:00:15,415
What can I do for you?

376
01:00:15,455 --> 01:00:20,526
We wanna find out about the ferry
to Guaymas. You wanna go fishing?

377
01:00:20,566 --> 01:00:26,241
Too bad. No ferry no more for the
next two months maybe. She burned up.

378
01:00:26,281 --> 01:00:32,555
Thank you. Fishing is good here. Not
as good as Guaymas or La Paz, but OK.

379
01:00:32,595 --> 01:00:36,750
You have motor boat?
You know someone who has one?

380
01:00:36,790 --> 01:00:41,705
Sure, sure. My friend Jime has one.
Motor runs good.

381
01:00:41,745 --> 01:00:49,376
Where is this Jime? In the mine,
where he works. Let's go. He's not
finished until six. Maybe tomorrow.

382
01:00:49,416 --> 01:00:52,015
I wanna go now.

383
01:00:52,055 --> 01:00:57,885
At six, then. By the time he gets
the boat ready, there is no sun.

384
01:00:59,685 --> 01:01:04,201
My friend does not like using
too much boat at night.

385
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:10,233
He sees his wife and kids
only at night. Give him some more.

386
01:01:10,273 --> 01:01:12,231
For me?

387
01:01:12,271 --> 01:01:15,270
Yeah. You pay my friend too? Yeah.

388
01:01:15,310 --> 01:01:19,991
You be at pier at 8.30.
The name of the boat is Estrella.

389
01:01:21,781 --> 01:01:24,591
A thousand thanks, senor.

390
01:01:26,181 --> 01:01:27,819
Good.

391
01:01:29,856 --> 01:01:34,498
We'll go to town and wait
by the water till dark. Let's go.

392
01:02:16,369 --> 01:02:19,566
Hold it a minute, will you? Hang on.

393
01:02:48,175 --> 01:02:52,498
Go fishing while you've the chance.
It's what you came for.

394
01:02:55,006 --> 01:02:57,846
You guys are really fools.

395
01:02:57,886 --> 01:03:02,200
If you wanted,
one of you would have got away.

396
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:07,355
But you kept thinking about each
other. So you missed some chances.

397
01:03:07,395 --> 01:03:10,518
You got tired. You slowed down.

398
01:03:11,712 --> 01:03:14,267
Now it's pretty late.

399
01:03:14,307 --> 01:03:17,304
Yeah, tomorrow I'll be in Guaymas.

400
01:03:18,825 --> 01:03:23,259
Too bad you're not making
the whole trip with me.

401
01:03:23,299 --> 01:03:26,501
That'd be kinda silly, wouldn't it?

402
01:03:31,568 --> 01:03:34,165
You stink, Myers!

403
01:03:34,205 --> 01:03:37,005
You smell. Just like your clothes.

404
01:03:37,045 --> 01:03:43,236
Sure, you'll get to Guaymas,
but they'll catch you
and put you out of your misery.

405
01:03:43,276 --> 01:03:48,553
You haven't got a chance. You haven't
got a thing except that gun.

406
01:03:48,593 --> 01:03:54,344
Better hang on to it, because without
it, you're nothing. You're finished.

407
01:03:54,384 --> 01:03:56,471
Shut up!

408
01:03:59,621 --> 01:04:01,657
Gracias, Carlos.

409
01:04:11,486 --> 01:04:13,090
Caramba!

410
01:04:15,283 --> 01:04:17,444
Pronto! La policia!

411
01:04:28,228 --> 01:04:32,949
Bueno. La policia.
No, no, no, la policia!

412
01:05:04,232 --> 01:05:06,280
Hold it.

413
01:05:12,741 --> 01:05:18,175
All right, Collins. Now you get
to take a nice walk all by yourself.

414
01:05:18,215 --> 01:05:25,046
Down the alley and out on the dock.
Me and Bowen will follow. If you tip
anyone off, I'll let Bowen have it.

415
01:05:25,086 --> 01:05:29,050
You wouldn't want that, would you?
Get going.

416
01:06:30,860 --> 01:06:33,417
Go ahead, Collins.

417
01:06:33,457 --> 01:06:37,376
All the way out.
Keep under the lights.

418
01:08:13,589 --> 01:08:17,065
Alto!

419
01:08:17,105 --> 01:08:20,422
Alto ahi! I'm not Myers!

420
01:08:20,462 --> 01:08:24,938
I'm not Myers! D'you hear me?
I'm not Myers!

421
01:08:32,567 --> 01:08:35,286
Alto! Alto!

422
01:08:42,516 --> 01:08:44,916
Alto! Alto ahi!

423
01:08:47,152 --> 01:08:49,473
Alto! Alto!

424
01:08:50,510 --> 01:08:53,274
Put your hands up. Walk this way.

425
01:08:55,346 --> 01:08:59,510
Do as he tells you, Myers.
You're all through.

426
01:09:46,210 --> 01:09:48,212
That's enough!

427
01:09:56,998 --> 01:10:01,915
I'm sorry.
We have to have full report.

428
01:10:01,955 --> 01:10:04,873
We understand. Gracias.

429
01:10:11,066 --> 01:10:12,590
It's all right.

430
01:10:13,305 --> 01:11:13,511
