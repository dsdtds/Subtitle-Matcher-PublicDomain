1
00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,743
[sci-fi sounds]

2
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:34,763
[dog barking]

3
00:02:47,428 --> 00:02:48,864
[cat screeching]

4
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:53,651
[dog barking]

5
00:04:23,567 --> 00:04:27,658
[gasping and struggling]

6
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:56,834
Only Chairman Mao has
the key to that lock.

7
00:05:56,965 --> 00:05:59,924
All we can do is to warn
the rest of the world.

8
00:06:00,055 --> 00:06:02,013
How much time is there?

9
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,363
Less than 72 hours.

10
00:06:21,729 --> 00:06:22,730
I have all I need.

11
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:23,513
All right.

12
00:06:23,644 --> 00:06:24,296
Follow me.

13
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,086
FEMALE PERSONNEL: 55 is
suspended several miles

14
00:07:58,216 --> 00:07:59,479
below the control unit.

15
00:08:03,787 --> 00:08:06,311
We are certain the
force of this detonation

16
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:09,837
will rupture the faults
of the Earth's surface

17
00:08:09,967 --> 00:08:12,796
and set off a chain
reaction of explosions

18
00:08:12,927 --> 00:08:15,930
when the Earth's
tension is broken.

19
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,758
There only 51 hours left.

20
00:08:17,888 --> 00:08:18,759
We better notify the president.

21
00:08:54,751 --> 00:08:57,580
MAN [ON PA]: No go on
pressure parity here.

22
00:08:57,711 --> 00:09:02,977
Two, check your output lodging
at uniform alpha double zulu.

23
00:09:03,107 --> 00:09:05,806
Unit niner, alpha two.

24
00:09:05,936 --> 00:09:08,809
We have a slight
hold at T minus 120.

25
00:09:08,939 --> 00:09:10,854
This is a fuel
pressure parity check.

26
00:09:10,985 --> 00:09:11,899
Repeat.

27
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:21,778
Hold at T minus 120.

28
00:09:21,909 --> 00:09:25,129
Gentlemen, it is T minus 120.

29
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:27,479
So we'll have to
make this very brief.

30
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,614
You all know Colonel Price, life
commander of our Project Astra.

31
00:09:31,745 --> 00:09:34,486
[applause]

32
00:09:37,098 --> 00:09:38,882
MAN: Colonel, why
this trip to Venus?

33
00:09:39,013 --> 00:09:41,406
I understand it's over
160 million miles away.

34
00:09:41,537 --> 00:09:43,104
It'll take you four
months to get there,

35
00:09:43,234 --> 00:09:45,715
and you'll be gone
for two years.

36
00:09:45,846 --> 00:09:47,935
Gentlemen, we've come a
long way in spaceflight

37
00:09:48,065 --> 00:09:49,676
in the last 10 years.

38
00:09:49,806 --> 00:09:53,375
Since 1965, our fixed
satellites, our space stations,

39
00:09:53,505 --> 00:09:56,247
our lunar landing, and base
established there several years

40
00:09:56,378 --> 00:10:00,295
ago, our probes of the outer
solar system, all these efforts

41
00:10:00,425 --> 00:10:03,298
have helped prepare us for
the payoff of phase one,

42
00:10:03,428 --> 00:10:05,343
putting man on Venus.

43
00:10:05,474 --> 00:10:06,910
MAN [ON PA]:
Attention, countdown

44
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,652
has resumed from T minus 120.

45
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:14,614
Repeat, countdown is
resuming from T minus 120.

46
00:10:14,744 --> 00:10:16,703
Gentlemen, any more questions?

47
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,401
Yes, why the astronauts
take the long way

48
00:10:19,531 --> 00:10:20,924
to get to a planet?

49
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,883
Instead of hopping
straight across to it?

50
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:25,407
MAN [ON PA]: Will Dr. Haines
contact operator five?

51
00:10:25,537 --> 00:10:26,669
Repeat.

52
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,802
Will Dr. Haines
contact operator five?

53
00:10:28,932 --> 00:10:31,543
Urgent.

54
00:10:31,674 --> 00:10:32,936
Operator.

55
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:36,331
Get me a ground control
then base security.

56
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:38,333
And operator, keep
this line open.

57
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:45,209
Actually, we take
the shortest route.

58
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:47,168
I'll show you.

59
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,779
This is the inner
solar system-- Mars,

60
00:10:49,910 --> 00:10:51,302
Earth, Venus, and Mercury.

61
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:54,349
Note Venus is the next
closest planet to the Sun.

62
00:10:54,479 --> 00:10:56,307
Your question is,
why don't we drop

63
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:58,048
right down here to
Venus, taking advantage

64
00:10:58,179 --> 00:10:59,789
of the sun's gravitation?

65
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,530
Venus wouldn't be there
when we got there.

66
00:11:01,661 --> 00:11:03,184
It travels along its own orbit.

67
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:04,707
You'll make a
rendezvous with it?

68
00:11:04,838 --> 00:11:06,883
Exactly.

69
00:11:07,014 --> 00:11:10,452
Colonel, make this brief.

70
00:11:10,582 --> 00:11:13,194
COLONEL PRICE: This is our
starting point and Venus

71
00:11:13,324 --> 00:11:15,196
at our point of rendezvous.

72
00:11:15,326 --> 00:11:18,416
Unit to orbit around the Earth
as a launching point in space.

73
00:11:18,547 --> 00:11:20,157
Then taking advantage
of the Earth's speed

74
00:11:20,288 --> 00:11:22,986
along its own orbit, we
take off into deep space

75
00:11:23,117 --> 00:11:25,946
on a ballistic course
that ends here.

76
00:11:26,076 --> 00:11:28,513
Now we drop into a Venus
orbit and prepare to land.

77
00:11:28,644 --> 00:11:30,777
And it's as simple as that?

78
00:11:30,907 --> 00:11:32,169
Nothing's that simple.

79
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:33,997
How long will the journey take?

80
00:11:34,128 --> 00:11:37,697
Barring unusual circumstances,
four months to reach Venus.

81
00:11:37,827 --> 00:11:40,177
But counting the return trip
and planned explorations,

82
00:11:40,308 --> 00:11:42,310
we'll be gone two years.

83
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,269
Well, what do you consider
unusual circumstances?

84
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,533
Anything we're not prepared
for-- excessive radiation,

85
00:11:48,664 --> 00:11:50,492
meteors, unknown factors.

86
00:11:50,622 --> 00:11:53,713
MAN [ON PA]: The time
is T minus 117 minutes.

87
00:11:53,843 --> 00:11:56,454
All unauthorized
personnel are instructed

88
00:11:56,585 --> 00:11:58,630
to clear the launch area.

89
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:01,721
Second stage fueling
will now begin.

90
00:12:01,851 --> 00:12:03,766
Flight crew stand by.

91
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:04,941
Repeat.

92
00:12:05,072 --> 00:12:07,683
Flight crew, stand by.

93
00:12:07,814 --> 00:12:08,902
That includes me, gentleman.

94
00:12:09,032 --> 00:12:11,339
WOMAN: Well, one
last thing, please.

95
00:12:11,469 --> 00:12:12,819
Yes?

96
00:12:12,949 --> 00:12:15,822
What about your family,
your wife, sweetheart?

97
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:18,215
That's the most difficult
part of the whole trip.

98
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:21,566
Two years alone?

99
00:12:21,697 --> 00:12:24,134
Gentlemen, thank you.

100
00:12:36,364 --> 00:12:37,539
Tech confirmed, Dr. Haines.

101
00:12:37,669 --> 00:12:39,019
Right from the top.

102
00:12:39,149 --> 00:12:40,020
Right, like this is it.

103
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:40,934
We'll speed it up.

104
00:12:41,064 --> 00:12:42,109
Right.

105
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:43,937
This is ground
control operation.

106
00:12:44,067 --> 00:12:45,199
Urgent.

107
00:12:45,329 --> 00:12:47,505
Unauthorized personnel
clear the area.

108
00:12:47,636 --> 00:12:50,726
Repeat, unauthorized
personnel clear the area.

109
00:12:58,299 --> 00:13:01,606
You still think an old
warhorse like me can't take it?

110
00:13:01,737 --> 00:13:03,391
Doesn't matter what
I think, doctor.

111
00:13:03,521 --> 00:13:05,872
Your technical knowledge gives
you an override on the computer

112
00:13:06,002 --> 00:13:07,482
to the contrary.

113
00:13:07,612 --> 00:13:08,962
I hope you make it.

114
00:13:09,092 --> 00:13:11,921
Frankly, so do I.
Anyhow, it'll be worth it.

115
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:14,489
You know, I've dreamt
of this adventure

116
00:13:14,619 --> 00:13:15,969
ever since I was a kid.

117
00:13:16,099 --> 00:13:17,361
That's tellin' them, doc.

118
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:20,582
It's the only way to go.

119
00:13:20,712 --> 00:13:21,539
I can think of other ways.

120
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,501
Especially for you.

121
00:13:26,631 --> 00:13:28,938
What's the matter, a navigator
got the countdown jitters?

122
00:13:29,069 --> 00:13:30,897
$10 billion worth of
taxpayers' money and we

123
00:13:31,027 --> 00:13:32,159
gotta put up with clowns.

124
00:13:32,289 --> 00:13:34,074
Come on, you two, cut it out.

125
00:13:34,204 --> 00:13:35,858
I just hope we're something
more than Guinea pigs

126
00:13:35,989 --> 00:13:38,600
for our brain trust out there.

127
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:40,863
MAN [ON PA]:
Attention t-minus 98.

128
00:13:40,994 --> 00:13:45,128
Stage one fueling
detail, stand by.

129
00:13:45,259 --> 00:13:46,434
Repeat.

130
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:49,480
Stage one fueling
detail, stand by.

131
00:13:49,611 --> 00:13:51,308
Hey, stage one.

132
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:53,310
That's the coal stuff, deluxe.

133
00:13:53,441 --> 00:13:55,225
What's happening?

134
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:56,661
They're speeding it up.

135
00:13:56,792 --> 00:13:58,098
Eh, it must be the weather.

136
00:13:58,228 --> 00:14:00,448
We're tied to those
tracking cameras.

137
00:14:00,578 --> 00:14:02,798
Who cares about pictures?

138
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:05,540
Doctor, get those Pentagon
pen pushers off their lard

139
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,933
and behind their computers.

140
00:14:07,063 --> 00:14:09,544
Our lives depend on
ballistics not pictures.

141
00:14:09,674 --> 00:14:12,373
MAN [ON PA]: Attention, all
base security personnel.

142
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:15,985
Attention, all base
security personnel.

143
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,769
This is a class 1 alert.

144
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,162
Condition red.

145
00:14:19,293 --> 00:14:21,251
Alpha phase is in effect.

146
00:14:21,382 --> 00:14:23,514
All civilians not
actually engaged

147
00:14:23,645 --> 00:14:26,909
in the Astra countdown report
to security headquarters

148
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,693
for reclassification.

149
00:14:28,824 --> 00:14:30,043
Been an alert?

150
00:14:30,173 --> 00:14:31,522
They must be kidding.

151
00:14:31,653 --> 00:14:33,133
Cruise ship went
up with miniskirts.

152
00:14:33,263 --> 00:14:35,222
This is 1975.

153
00:14:35,352 --> 00:14:36,876
Even if you kept up
with your comic books,

154
00:14:37,006 --> 00:14:38,703
you outta know what China's
been fooling around with.

155
00:14:43,012 --> 00:14:44,884
Give me control.

156
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:47,321
MAN [ON PA]: Attention,
all Sac personnel,

157
00:14:47,451 --> 00:14:49,714
report to duty
stations immediately.

158
00:14:49,845 --> 00:14:51,455
All leaves are cancelled.

159
00:14:51,586 --> 00:14:53,544
Base now operating
under martial law.

160
00:15:13,216 --> 00:15:13,869
What is this?

161
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,305
Where's the colonel?

162
00:15:15,436 --> 00:15:16,785
MAN [ON PA]: Astra
Control Center will amend

163
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,743
countdown to accelerate launch.

164
00:15:18,874 --> 00:15:21,790
All minor system check
outs are cancelled.

165
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:25,489
Reset all timers from T
minus 90 to T minus 50.

166
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:28,971
Flight crew, prepare
to board at T minus 30.

167
00:15:29,102 --> 00:15:30,930
Those check outs
can't be bypassed.

168
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:32,714
It's a red alert, Mason.

169
00:15:32,844 --> 00:15:33,889
The ICBMs are flying.

170
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:34,934
It's fairly simple.

171
00:15:35,064 --> 00:15:36,544
This base is a strategic target.

172
00:15:36,674 --> 00:15:37,893
They want us airborne.

173
00:15:38,024 --> 00:15:39,242
What do you say, doc?

174
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:40,113
Relax, Danny.

175
00:15:40,243 --> 00:15:41,114
We'll know soon enough.

176
00:15:57,043 --> 00:15:58,087
Sir, what is it?

177
00:15:58,218 --> 00:15:58,914
We've got to suit
up, [inaudible],

178
00:15:59,045 --> 00:16:00,437
take off T minus 30.

179
00:16:00,568 --> 00:16:02,657
Colonel, we can't let them
bypass those check outs.

180
00:16:02,787 --> 00:16:04,789
We've got to check
with security.

181
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:05,573
Excuse me, gentlemen.

182
00:16:08,924 --> 00:16:10,056
Are we under attack?

183
00:16:10,186 --> 00:16:11,492
COLONEL PRICE: All
I know, gentlemen,

184
00:16:11,622 --> 00:16:12,797
is that we're in some
kind of military crisis.

185
00:16:12,928 --> 00:16:14,495
It may or may not
be the big rumble,

186
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:15,844
but you know the routine.

187
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:17,367
All bases scramble,
and that includes

188
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:19,108
our big bird out there.

189
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:22,024
Colonel, what about
those secondary checks?

190
00:16:22,155 --> 00:16:23,547
You and Doc Perry
get together and see

191
00:16:23,678 --> 00:16:25,419
if you can live with your
pet fixes as they are.

192
00:16:25,549 --> 00:16:27,508
It's go for anything
short of a fuel leak.

193
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:30,076
What's the use of launching
if we're gonna blow it?

194
00:16:30,206 --> 00:16:31,773
You know as well as I do
without a full check out,

195
00:16:31,903 --> 00:16:33,079
anything can happen.

196
00:16:33,209 --> 00:16:34,558
And we're gonna be
out there two years.

197
00:16:34,689 --> 00:16:36,647
Anything can happen
while we're standing here.

198
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:50,705
Colonel Price?

199
00:16:50,835 --> 00:16:52,185
COLONEL PRICE: Yes.

200
00:16:52,315 --> 00:16:55,536
I'm from the Central
Intelligence Agency.

201
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:58,582
We have top priority for
replacement on this flight.

202
00:16:58,713 --> 00:16:59,627
Replacements?

203
00:16:59,757 --> 00:17:01,585
Colonel, I'm Donahue.

204
00:17:01,716 --> 00:17:02,717
This is Colonel Mathis.

205
00:17:02,847 --> 00:17:04,284
Hello.

206
00:17:04,414 --> 00:17:07,504
We have special orders
to you from the president.

207
00:17:07,635 --> 00:17:08,984
Gentlemen, what
is the situation?

208
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:11,900
Red alert, that is
all we can say now.

209
00:17:12,031 --> 00:17:13,423
Russia has advised us that--

210
00:17:13,554 --> 00:17:15,382
MAN [ON PA]: T minus 45 minutes.

211
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:16,905
General, there's no
time for that now.

212
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,777
You are to replace
three of your crew

213
00:17:19,908 --> 00:17:21,344
with three other officers.

214
00:17:21,475 --> 00:17:22,302
Women?

215
00:17:22,432 --> 00:17:24,304
Now I've heard everything.

216
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:25,653
Colonel, this is ridiculous.

217
00:17:25,783 --> 00:17:27,437
It's absolutely insane.

218
00:17:27,568 --> 00:17:29,309
Gentlemen, I don't understand.

219
00:17:29,439 --> 00:17:33,052
You will, colonel, but
there's no time to argue.

220
00:17:33,182 --> 00:17:34,314
What's this?

221
00:17:34,444 --> 00:17:36,185
Special sealed cargo.

222
00:17:36,316 --> 00:17:37,491
It's to go on board.

223
00:17:37,621 --> 00:17:38,361
I can't take extra weight.

224
00:17:38,492 --> 00:17:39,754
You know that.

225
00:17:39,884 --> 00:17:41,495
The weights have been
calculated, colonel.

226
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:44,324
We three women weigh less
than the men we're replacing.

227
00:17:44,454 --> 00:17:47,153
Oh, and, uh, just who do
you have in mind replacing?

228
00:17:47,283 --> 00:17:49,546
They're in your
orders, colonel.

229
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,418
Dr. Brown, flight surgeon.

230
00:17:51,548 --> 00:17:52,984
Well, that's me.

231
00:17:53,115 --> 00:17:55,378
Lieutenant [inaudible]
tech and assistant navigator

232
00:17:55,509 --> 00:17:58,816
and Major Williams, copilot
and systems engineer.

233
00:17:58,947 --> 00:17:59,904
Yes, sir.

234
00:18:00,035 --> 00:18:02,690
MAN [ON PA]: T minus 44 minutes.

235
00:18:02,820 --> 00:18:04,257
Pardon me, sir.

236
00:18:04,387 --> 00:18:06,694
You or the Joint
Chiefs or the president

237
00:18:06,824 --> 00:18:08,261
can order what you wish.

238
00:18:08,391 --> 00:18:11,177
But personally, I think
you're out of your minds.

239
00:18:11,307 --> 00:18:13,353
Colonel Price, it's not
in your province to judge.

240
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:14,136
Isn't it?

241
00:18:14,267 --> 00:18:15,355
COLONEL MATHIS: No.

242
00:18:15,485 --> 00:18:16,878
What about the
emotional stability

243
00:18:17,008 --> 00:18:19,402
of a mixed crew in deep
space for over two years?

244
00:18:19,533 --> 00:18:22,144
Colonel, we're quite stable.

245
00:18:22,275 --> 00:18:24,886
We have no special
accommodations on that ship.

246
00:18:25,016 --> 00:18:27,367
There's no privacy at all.

247
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:30,283
Nor are we asking for any
special privileges, sir.

248
00:18:30,413 --> 00:18:34,025
Colonel, this is
Dr. Marion Turner,

249
00:18:34,156 --> 00:18:37,464
flight surgeon, microbiologist.

250
00:18:37,594 --> 00:18:39,422
[whistles]

251
00:18:40,771 --> 00:18:42,469
Where do we put
on our suits, sir.

252
00:18:42,599 --> 00:18:43,948
There goes my stability.

253
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:45,559
What's the story, general?

254
00:18:45,689 --> 00:18:46,908
What's going on, general?

255
00:18:47,038 --> 00:18:47,952
Let us in on it.

256
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:48,866
Let us in and take some shots.

257
00:18:48,997 --> 00:18:50,607
Let us in.

258
00:18:50,738 --> 00:18:53,480
Lieutenant Carlson, computer
[inaudible] and meteorologist.

259
00:18:53,610 --> 00:18:55,003
Hi.

260
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,441
Major Bronski, copilot,
survival specialist.

261
00:18:58,572 --> 00:18:59,747
Bronski, the Russian?

262
00:18:59,877 --> 00:19:00,661
First woman on the moon.

263
00:19:00,791 --> 00:19:02,576
That is right.

264
00:19:02,706 --> 00:19:04,273
Fortunately, I was
at the International

265
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:08,408
Space Conference in Washington
when this emergency arose.

266
00:19:08,538 --> 00:19:09,931
I'm happy to say
that my government

267
00:19:10,061 --> 00:19:11,976
has authorized me to join you.

268
00:19:12,107 --> 00:19:13,195
Emergency?

269
00:19:13,326 --> 00:19:14,849
You haven't said
anything yet, doc.

270
00:19:14,979 --> 00:19:16,067
What can you say, colonel?

271
00:19:16,198 --> 00:19:18,113
It's a presidential order.

272
00:19:18,244 --> 00:19:19,767
There must be worst
fates, colonel.

273
00:19:19,897 --> 00:19:21,682
Gentlemen, I'd like
to consult our project

274
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:22,509
director, Dr. Haines.

275
00:19:22,639 --> 00:19:23,901
I'm sure he--

276
00:19:24,032 --> 00:19:25,903
CIA PERSONNEL: You don't
have time, colonel.

277
00:19:26,034 --> 00:19:28,079
Please get these
women ready at once.

278
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,038
MAN [ON PA]: T minus 43 minutes.

279
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:33,041
Attention, Astra flight
crew, stand by for man

280
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:35,086
pick up at T minus 30.

281
00:19:35,217 --> 00:19:36,610
I'm sorry, men.

282
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:38,916
Three years of preparation.

283
00:19:39,047 --> 00:19:42,355
Well, at least my wife will
appreciate these replacements.

284
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:43,182
Good luck, sir.

285
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:46,185
Thank you.

286
00:19:46,315 --> 00:19:46,968
Ladies?

287
00:19:52,234 --> 00:19:54,715
I don't believe it.

288
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:56,369
I don't believe it!

289
00:19:56,499 --> 00:19:59,807
You know, there must be a
practical side to having women.

290
00:19:59,937 --> 00:20:02,940
You mean, like having
your socks washed.

291
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,333
Everything OK?

292
00:20:04,464 --> 00:20:05,160
A OK.

293
00:20:14,952 --> 00:20:26,399
MAN [ON PA]: T minus 10,
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.

294
00:20:36,887 --> 00:20:39,977
Ground control to Astra.

295
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,241
Everything is A-OK from here.

296
00:20:45,113 --> 00:20:46,114
All systems are going.

297
00:20:46,245 --> 00:20:49,639
You have a good climbing angle.

298
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:53,948
Your velocity is 3250
at T plus two minutes.

299
00:20:54,078 --> 00:20:58,126
Confirm time sync and
prepare for booster cut off.

300
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,346
Astra to GC.

301
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:01,303
A-OK.

302
00:21:01,434 --> 00:21:03,827
All go here.

303
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:04,611
Time sync.

304
00:21:09,616 --> 00:21:14,185
T plus two minutes, 15 seconds.

305
00:21:14,316 --> 00:21:16,579
Cut off T plus three.

306
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:18,059
Read you loud and clear.

307
00:21:18,189 --> 00:21:22,237
Confirm BECO, at T plus three.

308
00:21:22,368 --> 00:21:24,805
We don't like Dr.
Perry's pulse here.

309
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:29,549
You'll have it made.

310
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:31,725
We can only take a second
stage into Earth orbit.

311
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:35,946
Astra to GC, read you.

312
00:21:36,077 --> 00:21:38,427
30 seconds to cut off.

313
00:21:38,558 --> 00:21:40,864
Colonel Price,
this is Dr. Turner.

314
00:21:40,995 --> 00:21:42,431
Clear the air, Dr. Turner.

315
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:44,694
How much time do we have
before second stage cut in?

316
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,087
Clear the air.

317
00:21:46,217 --> 00:21:48,785
Doctor, you would ha
several minutes at low G

318
00:21:48,916 --> 00:21:52,441
before the second booster
takes us into Earth's orbit.

319
00:21:52,572 --> 00:21:54,095
The ship's gravity
control is on.

320
00:21:54,225 --> 00:21:56,140
Ground to Astra.

321
00:21:56,271 --> 00:21:58,055
Dr. Turner has a point.

322
00:21:58,186 --> 00:21:59,666
Before second stage cut in--

323
00:21:59,796 --> 00:22:02,146
MAN [ON PA]: We are at T
plus two and 45 seconds.

324
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,566
Kurt, sequence your check outs.

325
00:22:30,697 --> 00:22:33,874
You've got two
minutes before cut in.

326
00:22:34,004 --> 00:22:35,919
Give me a half G on the
gravity neutralizer.

327
00:22:36,050 --> 00:22:37,791
You've got it.

328
00:22:37,921 --> 00:22:39,096
Colonel, what about Dr. Perry?

329
00:22:47,409 --> 00:22:48,062
He'll have to chance.

330
00:22:57,985 --> 00:23:00,204
Dr. Perry must have pure
oxygen. Now ask [inaudible]

331
00:23:00,335 --> 00:23:01,031
medical for his reading.

332
00:23:07,473 --> 00:23:10,693
Control to Astra, your
flight attitude is fair.

333
00:23:10,824 --> 00:23:13,609
Roll sequence is programming
in, changing [inaudible]

334
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,438
to 75 degrees northeast.

335
00:23:16,569 --> 00:23:17,221
Do you read?

336
00:23:22,618 --> 00:23:25,142
Astra to GC, roger.

337
00:23:25,273 --> 00:23:29,146
Take sequence 2-1 as follows.

338
00:23:29,277 --> 00:23:34,543
Cabin temperature
90, air pressure 5.5,

339
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:38,025
relative humidity 36 degrees.

340
00:23:38,155 --> 00:23:41,855
Sequence 2-5 next.

341
00:23:41,985 --> 00:23:43,770
Danny, read off.

342
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,468
It's 11-3 tracking
at green here,

343
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:49,079
a little hash from shielding.

344
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,561
Colonel, I warned you not to
bypass those subsystem checks.

345
00:23:52,692 --> 00:23:54,345
Take it, Kurt.

346
00:23:54,476 --> 00:23:57,000
Auto guidance is sluggish.

347
00:23:57,131 --> 00:24:00,134
Manual override seems OK.

348
00:24:00,264 --> 00:24:03,572
[inaudible] this is
following computer control.

349
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:05,792
Two degrees per second, over.

350
00:24:05,922 --> 00:24:07,533
Ground control to Astra.

351
00:24:07,663 --> 00:24:11,754
Dr. Turner, the arrow med
readings on Dr. Perry--

352
00:24:11,885 --> 00:24:15,628
Dr. Turner, you must
let me run this ship.

353
00:24:15,758 --> 00:24:18,631
Astra to ground, come in.

354
00:24:18,761 --> 00:24:21,547
MAN [ON PA]: You have one minute
before firing second stage.

355
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,070
Where is your prior fire data?

356
00:24:31,382 --> 00:24:33,515
Repeat, where is your
fire commit data?

357
00:24:36,518 --> 00:24:37,214
That's Perry's sequence.

358
00:24:42,089 --> 00:24:43,612
COLONEL PRICE: Major
Bronski, get into your seat.

359
00:24:43,743 --> 00:24:44,874
We fire in less than a minute.

360
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:51,359
Major Bronski!

361
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:57,974
MAN [ON PA]: Capcom to
Astra, for heat exchanges

362
00:24:58,105 --> 00:25:01,108
and pressurization,
give status on sequencer

363
00:25:01,238 --> 00:25:03,763
units before program commit.

364
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:05,852
Astra to Capcom.

365
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:09,508
We are T plus 4
minutes and 10 seconds.

366
00:25:09,638 --> 00:25:12,423
What is your attitude
for orbital entry?

367
00:25:12,554 --> 00:25:13,729
Are we hitting the slot?

368
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:15,514
MAN [ON PA]: Capcom to Astra.

369
00:25:15,644 --> 00:25:17,385
We can't bring up your nose.

370
00:25:17,516 --> 00:25:19,430
Hit your overrides
and fly by wire.

371
00:25:19,561 --> 00:25:22,521
You need four degrees
vertical pitch.

372
00:25:22,651 --> 00:25:23,957
Throw the automatic
tanks on manual.

373
00:25:24,087 --> 00:25:24,740
Bring us up.

374
00:25:28,265 --> 00:25:30,572
I'm on wire.

375
00:25:30,703 --> 00:25:33,488
[breathing heavily]

376
00:25:37,448 --> 00:25:39,668
That's it.

377
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:43,150
15 seconds to
second stage cut in.

378
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:46,283
Major Bronski,
Danny, 15 seconds!

379
00:25:59,601 --> 00:26:02,299
[breathing heavily]

380
00:26:05,346 --> 00:26:08,523
Commit the sequencers
on the gas generators.

381
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,357
Committed.

382
00:26:16,487 --> 00:26:17,271
Everybody grab tight.

383
00:26:21,667 --> 00:26:24,713
MAN [ON PA]: Capcom to
Astra, all lights are green.

384
00:26:24,844 --> 00:26:27,934
4, 3, 2, 1, 0.

385
00:27:04,927 --> 00:27:05,580
Good boy, Colonel.

386
00:27:05,711 --> 00:27:07,277
You're in the slot.

387
00:27:07,408 --> 00:27:08,714
Earth orbit established.

388
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:12,631
Prepare for Venus
launch at T plus 1100.

389
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:16,112
Venus launch, T plus 1100.

390
00:27:16,243 --> 00:27:18,898
Plus 11?

391
00:27:19,028 --> 00:27:21,117
They're moving us ahead again.

392
00:27:21,248 --> 00:27:22,597
DR. PERRY: Combustion
sequence in.

393
00:27:22,728 --> 00:27:24,207
First valve's green.

394
00:27:24,338 --> 00:27:26,514
Gas generator's full pressure.

395
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,297
You're A-OK.

396
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:48,841
You know, Dr.
Perry might've lost

397
00:27:48,971 --> 00:27:50,190
his life if you hadn't, uh--

398
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,061
We're thinking of one life.

399
00:27:52,192 --> 00:27:54,063
The colonel was
thinking of all of us.

400
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:57,980
Escape velocity reducing
to ballistic course speed.

401
00:27:58,111 --> 00:28:02,506
Dropping to 18,000
miles per hour.

402
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:06,510
Cabin pressure up
to a 0.9 atmospheres.

403
00:28:06,641 --> 00:28:14,127
Set control to AGCS and
secure final flight mod.

404
00:28:14,257 --> 00:28:15,389
And here we are.

405
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:18,218
The old girl
didn't pop a rivet.

406
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:21,961
Venus, open your arms.

407
00:28:22,091 --> 00:28:26,182
They sure pushed us
out of Earth orbit fast.

408
00:28:26,313 --> 00:28:27,401
I've got a feeling
there's something

409
00:28:27,531 --> 00:28:30,578
more than a war involved.

410
00:28:30,709 --> 00:28:33,450
You'll have plenty
of time to ask them.

411
00:28:33,581 --> 00:28:34,364
Everybody get unplugged.

412
00:28:38,934 --> 00:28:42,198
Does she know why we're here?

413
00:28:42,329 --> 00:28:43,199
No.

414
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,159
Are you going to tell her?

415
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:47,377
I hope she never
has to find out.

416
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:51,294
Yes.

417
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:18,191
What'd you read on
the Doppler scope?

418
00:29:18,321 --> 00:29:20,062
It's been throwing
out a good spectrum.

419
00:29:20,193 --> 00:29:20,889
Hmm.

420
00:29:24,023 --> 00:29:25,764
The shift is declining.

421
00:29:25,894 --> 00:29:28,201
[static]

422
00:29:30,333 --> 00:29:34,294
Velocity 17,500.

423
00:29:34,424 --> 00:29:37,079
I'd say we're 40,000 miles out.

424
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:39,038
Put it in the ship's computer
and see what we get, doc.

425
00:29:39,168 --> 00:29:40,300
Right.

426
00:29:40,430 --> 00:29:42,302
And let's get these
wires off, huh?

427
00:29:42,432 --> 00:29:43,999
Yeah.

428
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:45,827
What's her name, uh, Turner,
she's a doctor, isn't she?

429
00:29:45,958 --> 00:29:47,176
Mhm.

430
00:29:47,307 --> 00:29:49,135
Can't wait to take
inventory, huh, Kurt?

431
00:29:49,265 --> 00:29:51,615
I happen to think she knows
more about this cruise ship

432
00:29:51,746 --> 00:29:53,835
that she's letting on.

433
00:29:53,966 --> 00:29:55,532
Danny, give me a Aster control.

434
00:29:55,663 --> 00:29:58,318
I want to talk to Dr. Haynes.

435
00:29:58,448 --> 00:29:59,101
Right.

436
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:05,673
Hey, they've got us.

437
00:30:05,804 --> 00:30:07,936
Don't think about
Russia and the US.

438
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:09,764
Chinese are at it again.

439
00:30:09,895 --> 00:30:11,461
That's news?

440
00:30:11,592 --> 00:30:13,855
Picking up a bomb of static,
must be the Van Allen belt.

441
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:16,945
Or China with her nuclear toys.

442
00:30:17,076 --> 00:30:18,599
What does that mean, doc?

443
00:30:18,729 --> 00:30:21,254
Well, it's possible that new
device they came up with--

444
00:30:21,384 --> 00:30:22,821
Well, that's why
the big rumble.

445
00:30:22,951 --> 00:30:24,387
Well, that's my guess.

446
00:30:24,518 --> 00:30:27,042
Their principle could
start an uncontrolled chain

447
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:29,392
reaction, that is if they're
mad enough to try it.

448
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:34,441
Doc, you better
get your check up.

449
00:30:34,571 --> 00:30:36,878
Oh I'm much better,
thanks, much better.

450
00:30:37,009 --> 00:30:39,707
You know, for a while there,
I thought I'd never make it.

451
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,056
If it weren't for
you, I'd probably--

452
00:30:41,187 --> 00:30:42,101
Me?

453
00:30:42,231 --> 00:30:44,016
Thank Major Bronski and Danny.

454
00:30:44,146 --> 00:30:46,714
I don't know if they make
'em like that anymore.

455
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:47,497
Come on, Kurt.

456
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:55,114
They have to bury
these probes so deeply.

457
00:30:55,244 --> 00:30:56,767
It's less than a bee sting.

458
00:30:56,898 --> 00:30:58,682
[gasp]

459
00:30:59,858 --> 00:31:01,642
You could knock, Colonel Price.

460
00:31:01,772 --> 00:31:04,166
I thought the
proprieties were out.

461
00:31:04,297 --> 00:31:05,602
What's in?

462
00:31:05,733 --> 00:31:07,866
At least let us get
familiar with the routine.

463
00:31:07,996 --> 00:31:10,999
True, doctor, we do have
a long time ahead of us.

464
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,393
And with only three personnel
modules on this ship,

465
00:31:13,523 --> 00:31:16,787
we should get quite
familiar with the routine.

466
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:19,399
Why is this,
sophisticated Americans

467
00:31:19,529 --> 00:31:21,923
suffering from false modesty?

468
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,533
In Russia, we are more mature.

469
00:31:23,664 --> 00:31:27,407
Shall we proceed, doc?

470
00:31:27,537 --> 00:31:28,799
When you're through
in here, doctor.

471
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:36,807
Coming, Kurt?

472
00:31:36,938 --> 00:31:37,591
Oh.

473
00:31:43,292 --> 00:31:46,165
Nice, huh?

474
00:31:46,295 --> 00:31:49,255
Katie, this isn't a hay ride.

475
00:31:49,385 --> 00:31:51,300
We're here for a
serious purpose.

476
00:31:51,431 --> 00:31:53,781
What could be more
serious than a hay ride?

477
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:57,698
I don't think she realizes
how serious this is.

478
00:31:57,828 --> 00:31:59,091
What are you two talking about?

479
00:32:03,486 --> 00:32:04,096
There you go, major.

480
00:32:16,021 --> 00:32:19,633
I can't get over it.

481
00:32:19,763 --> 00:32:21,940
Putting females together
with the male animal

482
00:32:22,070 --> 00:32:24,072
in a cage like this.

483
00:32:24,203 --> 00:32:26,205
What are we supposed to
do for the next two years?

484
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:26,988
Breed?

485
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,341
How about some
check outs while, uh,

486
00:32:32,472 --> 00:32:33,690
communications clear?

487
00:32:33,821 --> 00:32:35,257
You know something?

488
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:38,260
Kurt could have a point here.

489
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:39,783
What do you mean?

490
00:32:39,914 --> 00:32:42,525
Well, those Pentagon
computers are pretty sharp.

491
00:32:42,656 --> 00:32:44,092
Sending us three women?

492
00:32:44,223 --> 00:32:49,141
Well, supposing China
did destroy the world,

493
00:32:49,271 --> 00:32:51,970
could be nothing left
for us to come back to.

494
00:32:52,100 --> 00:32:53,580
Come on, doc,
you're space happy.

495
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,103
You've been reading
the pulps again.

496
00:32:55,234 --> 00:32:55,886
Doomsday.

497
00:32:56,017 --> 00:32:57,323
[chuckles] Get him.

498
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,069
Well, I mean, you guys aren't
taking him seriously, are you?

499
00:33:04,199 --> 00:33:06,419
Those chopstick jockeys couldn't
come off with a planet buster,

500
00:33:06,549 --> 00:33:07,811
could they?

501
00:33:07,942 --> 00:33:09,944
Look, it doesn't have
to be the Chinese.

502
00:33:10,075 --> 00:33:11,685
Accidents could
happen on any sign.

503
00:33:14,731 --> 00:33:16,342
For the love of--
increase the gravity.

504
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:17,125
Right.

505
00:33:22,957 --> 00:33:25,568
Ham sandwich?

506
00:33:25,699 --> 00:33:26,395
With mustard.

507
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,750
This is the first time I've
seen the Earth and the moon

508
00:33:33,881 --> 00:33:36,014
together from space.

509
00:33:36,144 --> 00:33:38,712
Of course, the Russian
probes have photographed

510
00:33:38,842 --> 00:33:41,845
most of the solar system.

511
00:33:41,976 --> 00:33:44,587
Of course.

512
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,894
I speak the simple
truth, comrade Mason.

513
00:33:47,025 --> 00:33:51,029
So do I. And don't
call me comrade.

514
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:57,513
First into space, first to
set the record for manned

515
00:33:57,644 --> 00:33:59,559
orbital flight, first to--

516
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:02,127
The question isn't
what you did but how.

517
00:34:02,257 --> 00:34:03,563
What do you mean?

518
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:05,913
I saw one of your
unannounced tries in Earth

519
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:09,786
orbit, a ruptured hulk with
a corpse for a passenger.

520
00:34:09,917 --> 00:34:11,484
How many more are there?

521
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:15,792
Perhaps, Captain Mason, we
are more dedicated to science.

522
00:34:15,923 --> 00:34:16,924
To science?

523
00:34:17,055 --> 00:34:18,447
Ha.

524
00:34:18,578 --> 00:34:20,232
Hey, Kurt, lay off, will you?

525
00:34:20,362 --> 00:34:22,364
I can take care of
myself, lieutenant.

526
00:34:22,495 --> 00:34:24,671
I'm sure you can, major.

527
00:34:24,801 --> 00:34:26,238
But if you ever need the
reserves, just whistle.

528
00:34:29,415 --> 00:34:30,807
I'll be on the lower
deck if I'm needed.

529
00:34:36,248 --> 00:34:37,075
He's not really a fink.

530
00:34:37,205 --> 00:34:38,685
He just asks like one.

531
00:34:38,815 --> 00:34:39,947
A what?

532
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:40,730
Never mind.

533
00:35:08,671 --> 00:35:10,543
Hello.

534
00:35:10,673 --> 00:35:11,674
Enjoy your shower?

535
00:35:11,805 --> 00:35:13,937
Mm.

536
00:35:14,068 --> 00:35:15,200
Love your homemade water.

537
00:35:25,297 --> 00:35:28,735
We do travel first class.

538
00:35:28,865 --> 00:35:31,477
Where's that music coming from?

539
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:34,436
Our latter day Marconi seems to
have broken through the static.

540
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:35,698
Who?

541
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:38,005
Oh, Danny.

542
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:39,702
I think he's cute.

543
00:35:39,833 --> 00:35:40,660
If you like boys.

544
00:35:48,537 --> 00:35:53,020
Say, I've been wondering,
uh, do you got a specialty?

545
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:54,021
Uh-huh.

546
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,023
Oh?

547
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,285
Meteorology.

548
00:35:57,416 --> 00:35:58,068
Oh.

549
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:03,987
Would you care to join
me on a tour of the ship,

550
00:36:04,118 --> 00:36:05,554
see what makes it tick?

551
00:36:05,685 --> 00:36:07,382
I know what it makes it tick.

552
00:36:07,513 --> 00:36:08,166
You do?

553
00:36:08,296 --> 00:36:08,992
Uh-huh.

554
00:36:11,691 --> 00:36:14,520
You're divorced.

555
00:36:14,650 --> 00:36:18,567
Colonel Price is separated
from his wife at present.

556
00:36:18,698 --> 00:36:26,923
And Danny, sweet,
merit badge for him.

557
00:36:27,054 --> 00:36:29,839
You do get around.

558
00:36:29,970 --> 00:36:33,756
You, uh, forgot grandpa.

559
00:36:33,887 --> 00:36:37,891
Dr. Perry's age will
protect me there.

560
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:39,197
I wouldn't bank on it.

561
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:46,378
Let's cut out the games, huh?

562
00:36:46,508 --> 00:36:48,510
You know what's ahead of us.

563
00:36:48,641 --> 00:36:51,948
We're all gonna be cozy
together for a nice, long time.

564
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:56,562
Now why don't you
relax and enjoy it.

565
00:37:09,749 --> 00:37:12,142
You're very
forceful, aren't you?

566
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:14,580
Do I, uh, need force?

567
00:37:14,710 --> 00:37:16,973
I was talking about vibration.

568
00:37:17,104 --> 00:37:19,367
Oh.

569
00:37:19,498 --> 00:37:21,674
How are yours doing?

570
00:37:21,804 --> 00:37:24,764
What do they say?

571
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,027
I'm not sure, but I like 'em.

572
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:36,950
And they like you-- in time.

573
00:38:52,112 --> 00:38:54,593
Oh, you startled me.

574
00:38:54,723 --> 00:38:58,074
I'm, uh, finding a high
DNA distortion rate

575
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,426
due to, uh, hard radiation.

576
00:39:01,556 --> 00:39:05,778
Probably the Van Allen
belt or solar flares.

577
00:39:05,908 --> 00:39:09,303
Speaking of flares,
I, uh, wonder what

578
00:39:09,434 --> 00:39:10,609
happened to the
fireworks back home.

579
00:39:13,612 --> 00:39:15,570
Well, I just thank God that
any destruction was averted.

580
00:39:19,618 --> 00:39:21,315
COLONEL PRICE: I could've
told them they were crazy.

581
00:39:21,446 --> 00:39:24,971
This whole mess was unnecessary.

582
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:27,974
I mean, bringing
you women along.

583
00:39:28,104 --> 00:39:30,063
Some stargazer panicked
and thought the world

584
00:39:30,193 --> 00:39:32,935
was going to end, didn't he?

585
00:39:33,066 --> 00:39:34,720
It was a joint
recommendation of a National

586
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,723
Security Committee and the
Scientific Advisory Board.

587
00:39:37,853 --> 00:39:40,595
The president had to act
before the Astra was launched.

588
00:39:40,726 --> 00:39:42,728
So in case the
world did end, they

589
00:39:42,858 --> 00:39:44,338
figured a few people
like you and me could

590
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:47,950
do a rerun on Adam and Eve?

591
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:49,474
Yes.

592
00:39:49,604 --> 00:39:50,388
Something like that.

593
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:56,263
Look, colonel, we're only doing
what we were ordered to do.

594
00:39:56,394 --> 00:39:59,658
And if it doesn't suit
you, well, I'm very sorry.

595
00:39:59,788 --> 00:40:02,356
You know, without your glasses,
you're a very pretty doctor.

596
00:40:11,409 --> 00:40:13,759
Oh, sorry.

597
00:40:13,889 --> 00:40:15,630
I came to see about supper.

598
00:40:15,761 --> 00:40:17,589
Uh, it's the altitude.

599
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:20,722
It works up the appetite.

600
00:40:20,853 --> 00:40:24,944
--[clears throat]
I'll help you, Katie.

601
00:40:25,074 --> 00:40:31,864
But doctor, Captain Mason has
not, uh, got to me, as you say.

602
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:35,258
Ah, there we are folks,
fresh off the space farm.

603
00:40:35,389 --> 00:40:37,739
I must confess, your
country is certainly

604
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:40,438
first in the culinary
art of space cooking.

605
00:40:40,568 --> 00:40:41,613
Ah, it now delicious, Danny.

606
00:40:41,743 --> 00:40:42,396
Thank you.

607
00:40:50,535 --> 00:40:55,583
By they way, major, remember
those Russian ghost ships

608
00:40:55,714 --> 00:40:57,846
that Kurt mentioned?

609
00:40:57,977 --> 00:40:58,934
I'd like to ask you--

610
00:40:59,065 --> 00:41:01,415
I know of no ghost ships.

611
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:05,593
Well, there was an early Venus
probe, the, uh, Izvestia II,

612
00:41:05,724 --> 00:41:07,377
I believe.

613
00:41:07,508 --> 00:41:10,076
Yes, the Izvestia II.

614
00:41:10,206 --> 00:41:12,339
That was lost in space.

615
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:16,474
Well, it's maneuvers were
much too sophisticated

616
00:41:16,604 --> 00:41:18,171
for it to be unmanned.

617
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,652
Izvestia II was a robot ship.

618
00:41:20,782 --> 00:41:22,218
There were no men aboard.

619
00:41:22,349 --> 00:41:23,785
I see.

620
00:41:23,916 --> 00:41:25,613
Then it was purely coincidental
that a certain Igor

621
00:41:25,744 --> 00:41:29,051
Nikonov just
happened to disappear

622
00:41:29,182 --> 00:41:30,749
just about that same time?

623
00:41:30,879 --> 00:41:33,665
Colonel Nikonov did
not die in space.

624
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:36,798
They would have told us.

625
00:41:36,929 --> 00:41:39,279
I knew him very well.

626
00:41:39,409 --> 00:41:42,761
He was my instructor in
astronautical science and--

627
00:41:42,891 --> 00:41:47,809
Yes, he was also a very
important party man.

628
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,205
We do not mix
politics with science.

629
00:41:52,335 --> 00:41:53,162
MAN [ON RADIO]: We interrupt--

630
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:09,222
He was cut off.

631
00:42:16,838 --> 00:42:17,752
What's happening?

632
00:42:17,883 --> 00:42:19,537
Why did the delay?

633
00:42:19,667 --> 00:42:21,103
A million miles out, it takes
a few seconds for transmission

634
00:42:21,234 --> 00:42:22,017
to return.

635
00:42:22,148 --> 00:42:22,931
What do you see, Kurt?

636
00:42:23,062 --> 00:42:24,585
Nothing unusual.

637
00:42:24,716 --> 00:42:25,368
Still there.

638
00:42:30,983 --> 00:42:31,810
What is it?

639
00:42:38,468 --> 00:42:40,514
MAJOR MASON: My god!

640
00:42:40,645 --> 00:42:41,297
They did it.

641
00:42:44,736 --> 00:42:46,694
It's happened.

642
00:42:46,825 --> 00:42:47,521
Pure war.

643
00:42:57,096 --> 00:42:58,140
Come on, everybody.

644
00:42:58,271 --> 00:42:59,011
What's all the big
surprise about?

645
00:43:03,537 --> 00:43:14,635
Two years from now
when we get back-- when

646
00:43:14,766 --> 00:43:19,466
we get back-- if we get back.

647
00:43:22,295 --> 00:43:24,689
No, no.

648
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:26,952
[SCREAMS] No!

649
00:43:27,082 --> 00:43:29,258
[explosions]

650
00:43:31,826 --> 00:43:37,136
It's the one thing we feared,
nuclear chain reaction.

651
00:43:37,266 --> 00:43:38,485
[explosions]

652
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:42,010
It can't be.

653
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:45,057
Yes, it is.

654
00:43:45,187 --> 00:43:46,972
How?

655
00:43:47,102 --> 00:43:48,626
No.

656
00:43:48,756 --> 00:43:49,409
No.

657
00:43:54,370 --> 00:43:56,024
That static.

658
00:43:56,155 --> 00:43:57,852
It's radiation.

659
00:43:57,983 --> 00:43:59,462
Oh!

660
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:01,377
Ah.

661
00:44:01,508 --> 00:44:02,161
Get me the filters.

662
00:44:09,690 --> 00:44:11,823
Bring it in close.

663
00:44:11,953 --> 00:44:15,653
[explosions]

664
00:44:21,659 --> 00:44:23,225
It's gone.

665
00:44:23,356 --> 00:44:27,142
[explosions]

666
00:44:32,147 --> 00:44:34,933
Hold on.

667
00:44:35,063 --> 00:44:37,413
[cries]

668
00:44:40,503 --> 00:44:43,071
Would you shut up?

669
00:44:43,202 --> 00:44:44,203
Mason!

670
00:44:44,333 --> 00:44:45,508
-Will you shut up?
-[screams]

671
00:44:45,639 --> 00:44:46,422
Shut up!

672
00:45:17,584 --> 00:45:19,586
That should quiet her.

673
00:45:19,717 --> 00:45:20,456
What about you?

674
00:45:20,587 --> 00:45:22,545
You gonna be all right?

675
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:24,809
Yeah.

676
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:26,462
I'm just so cold.

677
00:45:26,593 --> 00:45:32,860
So am I. Radiation.

678
00:45:32,991 --> 00:45:34,383
Yes, and it's rising.

679
00:45:34,514 --> 00:45:37,778
But that's not all,
Don, Earth fragments,

680
00:45:37,909 --> 00:45:40,172
great broken masses
of land hurdling

681
00:45:40,302 --> 00:45:41,739
toward us at meteoric speed.

682
00:45:41,869 --> 00:45:43,566
Earth fragments,
that's right, meteors.

683
00:45:43,697 --> 00:45:46,352
We'll have to change
if they get any closer.

684
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:48,223
You and Kurt get the
radiation shielding up.

685
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:49,007
Right.

686
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,590
We're gonna make it.

687
00:46:07,721 --> 00:46:10,550
Well, I hope so.

688
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:12,030
I-- I want to live.

689
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:17,209
[SCREAMS] I want to live!

690
00:46:20,647 --> 00:46:23,345
Come on, Kurt, get
a hold of yourself.

691
00:46:23,476 --> 00:46:24,520
We all want to live.

692
00:46:28,698 --> 00:46:32,877
Danny, Danny, do you hear me?

693
00:46:33,007 --> 00:46:34,487
He's just been
sitting there like.

694
00:46:38,970 --> 00:46:40,798
He reminds me of my
little brother years

695
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:42,843
ago when he fell from
the roof of the barn.

696
00:46:45,585 --> 00:46:46,891
He's gonna be all right.

697
00:46:47,021 --> 00:46:49,110
Danny.

698
00:46:49,241 --> 00:46:50,546
Danny.

699
00:46:50,677 --> 00:46:51,330
Danny!

700
00:46:55,377 --> 00:46:57,249
What happened?

701
00:46:57,379 --> 00:46:59,207
He's all right.

702
00:46:59,338 --> 00:47:00,687
I'll be out if you need me.

703
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:09,000
I'm some astronaut.

704
00:47:09,130 --> 00:47:10,610
There's nothing to be
ashamed of, lieutenant.

705
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,525
We're all very shaken up.

706
00:47:12,655 --> 00:47:14,614
You seem very calm.

707
00:47:14,744 --> 00:47:17,660
My years of training.

708
00:47:17,791 --> 00:47:19,488
Say, what made you
become an astronaut?

709
00:47:19,619 --> 00:47:21,229
You ask because I have a woman?

710
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,970
Yeah.

711
00:47:23,101 --> 00:47:26,365
In my country, women follow
the same professions as men.

712
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:29,629
I excelled in science
in the university.

713
00:47:29,759 --> 00:47:31,152
It was only natural
that I should become

714
00:47:31,283 --> 00:47:33,633
a part of the space program.

715
00:47:33,763 --> 00:47:35,069
Were you interested in it?

716
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,637
It never occurred
to me to question.

717
00:47:37,767 --> 00:47:41,206
I followed the advice
of my superiors.

718
00:47:41,336 --> 00:47:44,774
I was proud to be the only
woman in a class with six men.

719
00:47:44,905 --> 00:47:46,124
Oh?

720
00:47:46,254 --> 00:47:50,389
Well, uh, don't you
miss being a woman?

721
00:47:50,519 --> 00:47:52,043
I mean--

722
00:47:52,173 --> 00:47:54,915
I know what you mean.

723
00:47:55,046 --> 00:47:57,918
You know something, Danny?

724
00:47:58,049 --> 00:47:58,919
I like you.

725
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,486
You do?

726
00:48:00,616 --> 00:48:02,488
Yes, Danny, I do.

727
00:48:16,850 --> 00:48:19,374
That's a lot better.

728
00:48:19,505 --> 00:48:21,550
That curtain cuts the
radiation to about 5%.

729
00:48:28,601 --> 00:48:31,038
Flight crew, secure.

730
00:48:31,169 --> 00:48:32,300
Get into your seats.

731
00:48:32,431 --> 00:48:33,084
Meteors.

732
00:48:36,174 --> 00:48:38,741
Repeat, secure.

733
00:48:38,872 --> 00:48:41,135
Meteors, meteors.

734
00:48:41,266 --> 00:48:44,312
Come on, Mason.

735
00:48:44,443 --> 00:48:45,270
You OK?

736
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,619
Yes, sir.

737
00:48:46,749 --> 00:48:47,402
Come on, then.

738
00:48:54,453 --> 00:48:55,323
Our suits!

739
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:56,803
There's no time.

740
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:00,589
Hold the cabin pressure
at 0.9 atmospheres.

741
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,503
Let's do it!

742
00:49:04,463 --> 00:49:06,682
What if we catch
a-- hole in the hull?

743
00:49:06,813 --> 00:49:08,641
We've got emergency patches.

744
00:49:08,771 --> 00:49:12,253
Without suits, we'd never
get a chance to use them.

745
00:49:12,384 --> 00:49:12,993
Here we go.

746
00:49:19,913 --> 00:49:22,698
[incessant beeping]

747
00:49:24,004 --> 00:49:25,266
Would you cut
that damned alarm?

748
00:49:25,397 --> 00:49:26,702
It's driving me nuts!

749
00:49:26,833 --> 00:49:29,792
It's 15 degrees
elevation, fast.

750
00:49:29,923 --> 00:49:32,665
We're-- we're not plotted.

751
00:49:32,795 --> 00:49:34,188
We'll get lost.

752
00:49:34,319 --> 00:49:36,495
15 degrees.

753
00:49:36,625 --> 00:49:37,322
15 degrees!

754
00:49:49,551 --> 00:49:51,901
Doc, how much reserve
fuel can I use?

755
00:49:52,032 --> 00:49:53,903
We've go the whole
return booster.

756
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:56,341
We're not going home, so
shoot the works, skipper.

757
00:49:56,471 --> 00:49:57,646
Why don't you shut up?

758
00:49:57,777 --> 00:49:58,473
Mason.

759
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:02,434
We're clear.

760
00:50:02,564 --> 00:50:05,045
Drop us back 15.

761
00:50:05,176 --> 00:50:05,828
Cut the engines.

762
00:50:08,918 --> 00:50:09,789
Cut the engines.

763
00:50:09,919 --> 00:50:11,356
Save the fuel.

764
00:50:11,486 --> 00:50:14,011
I will when you level out.

765
00:50:14,141 --> 00:50:14,794
Oh.

766
00:50:24,847 --> 00:50:27,067
COLONEL PRICE: Way off course,
but until this meteor traffic

767
00:50:27,198 --> 00:50:28,677
bends, we've got
no other choice.

768
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:30,201
How much fuel did
we use, Skipper?

769
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:33,682
We've used 20% of
the third stage tanks.

770
00:50:33,813 --> 00:50:36,294
And it'll take that much again
to get us back on course.

771
00:50:36,424 --> 00:50:37,817
Mason, relax.

772
00:50:37,947 --> 00:50:39,471
It's only fuel we would've
used on the return trip.

773
00:50:39,601 --> 00:50:41,255
Doc?

774
00:50:41,386 --> 00:50:42,952
We need a new course.

775
00:50:43,083 --> 00:50:48,175
What we need is time to collect
what brains we have left.

776
00:50:48,306 --> 00:50:51,135
What are we gonna do?

777
00:50:51,265 --> 00:50:52,484
What's gonna happen to us?

778
00:51:04,191 --> 00:51:05,366
How do you feel?

779
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:07,194
Lousy.

780
00:51:07,325 --> 00:51:09,892
All right.

781
00:51:10,023 --> 00:51:12,504
Let's run a play back on this
whole thing from the beginning.

782
00:51:18,336 --> 00:51:21,687
So fortunately for us,
they saw the end coming

783
00:51:21,817 --> 00:51:24,559
and reshuffled our crew.

784
00:51:24,690 --> 00:51:25,865
In other words,
we've been paired

785
00:51:25,995 --> 00:51:29,347
off on a latter day Noah's ark.

786
00:51:29,477 --> 00:51:34,308
Well, there's nothing like
facing the facts, is there?

787
00:51:34,439 --> 00:51:38,443
I've got myself railroaded
into a stud poker game.

788
00:51:38,573 --> 00:51:39,661
Hey!

789
00:51:39,792 --> 00:51:41,489
Not bad, eh, kid?

790
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,057
Who'd a thought of it?

791
00:51:44,188 --> 00:51:45,841
Katie Carlson, the
girl who thought she

792
00:51:45,972 --> 00:51:48,192
had everything going for her.

793
00:51:48,322 --> 00:51:50,019
Now the future
mother of a nation.

794
00:51:52,457 --> 00:51:53,110
Katie!

795
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:02,771
May, uh, an older
man offer something?

796
00:52:02,902 --> 00:52:05,600
The past is gone.

797
00:52:05,731 --> 00:52:11,040
Every second brings us closer
to a new, untouched world,

798
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,652
our world.

799
00:52:13,782 --> 00:52:15,915
We're the lucky ones.

800
00:52:16,045 --> 00:52:18,613
At least we have a tomorrow.

801
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:37,110
Doc, he got us back
on course again.

802
00:52:37,241 --> 00:52:39,808
All we have to do is slide
down your orbit, four months of

803
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:41,767
free falling, and we're home.

804
00:52:41,897 --> 00:52:45,118
Don, can I talk to you alone?

805
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:47,076
Sure, doc.

806
00:52:47,207 --> 00:52:49,035
Kurt?

807
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:50,558
Uh-uh.

808
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:55,737
Rank has no privileges
anymore and no secrets.

809
00:52:55,868 --> 00:52:57,174
It's all right, doc, go ahead.

810
00:52:57,304 --> 00:52:59,567
All right.

811
00:52:59,698 --> 00:53:01,830
We can't afford four months.

812
00:53:01,961 --> 00:53:04,572
We've got to get there
in less than two.

813
00:53:04,703 --> 00:53:05,704
Two?

814
00:53:05,834 --> 00:53:06,705
Impossible.

815
00:53:06,835 --> 00:53:08,141
We'd drain the fuel.

816
00:53:08,272 --> 00:53:09,490
We wouldn't have enough
to make the Venus entry.

817
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:11,536
The Earth's
explosion has tripled

818
00:53:11,666 --> 00:53:12,580
the radiation out there.

819
00:53:12,711 --> 00:53:13,712
And it's non-directional.

820
00:53:13,842 --> 00:53:15,496
We just can't shield it out.

821
00:53:15,627 --> 00:53:17,803
Ah, it's mostly soft
stuff, alphas and betas.

822
00:53:17,933 --> 00:53:20,197
The gamma concentration
isn't critical.

823
00:53:20,327 --> 00:53:22,416
Yes, I know but for
months' exposure to it

824
00:53:22,547 --> 00:53:25,550
will mean just one
thing-- sterilization.

825
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:27,900
[chuckles]

826
00:53:29,945 --> 00:53:33,079
In hell do you find amusing?

827
00:53:33,210 --> 00:53:34,733
Procreation.

828
00:53:34,863 --> 00:53:38,389
[chuckles] The only thing
our damn machines can't do,

829
00:53:38,519 --> 00:53:39,738
and we're gonna lose.

830
00:53:39,868 --> 00:53:42,480
[laughs]

831
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:48,399
At most, doc, we-- we
can't land without fuel.

832
00:53:48,529 --> 00:53:51,402
A few could by
stripping the ship,

833
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:53,012
dropping the booster shelf.

834
00:53:53,142 --> 00:53:55,406
Oh, I know it sounds ridiculous
to say that the weight

835
00:53:55,536 --> 00:53:58,626
of a few people could affect
the safety of a 50-ton ship,

836
00:53:58,757 --> 00:54:00,802
but I've checked and
rechecked it on the computer,

837
00:54:00,933 --> 00:54:03,675
and-- and there's
no other answer.

838
00:54:03,805 --> 00:54:04,980
Our fuel?

839
00:54:05,111 --> 00:54:09,028
But-- yes, Georgianna?

840
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:12,379
I just came in to
open the ISPM switches.

841
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,076
Danny and Katie are
doing maintenance

842
00:54:14,207 --> 00:54:15,643
on the digital units.

843
00:54:15,774 --> 00:54:19,125
Yes I asked him to check
the stellar beam registers.

844
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:20,735
We can't get a
good fix on Sirius.

845
00:54:20,866 --> 00:54:21,562
I see.

846
00:54:26,654 --> 00:54:28,090
How long was she standing there?

847
00:54:31,877 --> 00:54:32,965
I don't know.

848
00:54:38,623 --> 00:54:40,233
Georgianna?

849
00:54:40,364 --> 00:54:41,016
What is it?

850
00:55:14,354 --> 00:55:17,531
Well, that should do it.

851
00:55:17,662 --> 00:55:19,620
Hey.

852
00:55:19,751 --> 00:55:21,056
Hey, those are tears.

853
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:56,831
Something else you wanted?

854
00:55:56,962 --> 00:55:57,963
Mhm.

855
00:55:58,093 --> 00:55:58,746
Don't.

856
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:08,147
Don't your vibrations ever stop?

857
00:56:08,277 --> 00:56:11,063
You know it has to
be sooner or later.

858
00:56:11,193 --> 00:56:12,151
Why don't we make it sooner?

859
00:56:19,593 --> 00:56:20,855
[screams]

860
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:22,335
[screams]

861
00:56:22,466 --> 00:56:23,380
For god sakes, cool it, Mason.

862
00:56:23,510 --> 00:56:24,903
What are you trying to do?

863
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:27,601
As if I couldn't guess.

864
00:56:27,732 --> 00:56:29,386
Take your hands off her.

865
00:56:29,516 --> 00:56:32,171
It's too damn crowded in this
sardine can to be playing tag.

866
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:33,390
I said take your hands off her.

867
00:56:39,439 --> 00:56:41,789
Break it up!

868
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:43,487
Mason, I've had it with you.

869
00:56:43,617 --> 00:56:45,010
Either you straighten
up or spend the next two

870
00:56:45,140 --> 00:56:45,837
months locked below.

871
00:56:53,845 --> 00:56:56,369
Come on forward.

872
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:57,762
Dr. Perry has something
to say to all of us.

873
00:57:07,467 --> 00:57:11,645
So you see, the omnipresence
of all this radiation

874
00:57:11,776 --> 00:57:15,083
leaves us no option.

875
00:57:15,214 --> 00:57:21,046
We have to protect the three
people who'll survived.

876
00:57:21,176 --> 00:57:22,439
Three?

877
00:57:22,569 --> 00:57:24,005
Yes, three.

878
00:57:24,136 --> 00:57:26,834
So four of us will
have to [inaudible].

879
00:57:26,965 --> 00:57:30,185
Fuel and weight factors
leave us no other choice.

880
00:57:30,316 --> 00:57:32,274
It's beyond despairing.

881
00:57:32,405 --> 00:57:34,189
Why should you despair?

882
00:57:34,320 --> 00:57:37,279
In a fire, the mares are
always saved, aren't they?

883
00:57:37,410 --> 00:57:39,978
Nothing ever changes
in space or people.

884
00:57:40,108 --> 00:57:42,415
OK who decides what?

885
00:57:42,546 --> 00:57:44,286
We have everyone's XL file.

886
00:57:44,417 --> 00:57:45,766
A computer will be programmed.

887
00:57:45,897 --> 00:57:47,159
Ha.

888
00:57:47,289 --> 00:57:48,813
Sex and the machine.

889
00:57:48,943 --> 00:57:49,988
Well, who does the programming?

890
00:57:56,821 --> 00:57:57,778
Dr. Perry.

891
00:57:57,909 --> 00:57:58,518
Any objections?

892
00:58:45,609 --> 00:58:48,481
COLONEL PRICE:
We'll be there soon.

893
00:58:48,612 --> 00:58:49,961
It'll remind you
of home, I hope.

894
00:58:53,617 --> 00:58:56,533
How close are we?

895
00:58:56,663 --> 00:58:59,144
Less than a million miles.

896
00:58:59,274 --> 00:59:03,844
Only a few days now, and we'll
be entering into orbit around.

897
00:59:03,975 --> 00:59:06,368
Only three of us.

898
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:07,326
Only three.

899
00:59:11,896 --> 00:59:13,419
I hope you're one of them.

900
00:59:19,033 --> 00:59:20,208
I hope you are.

901
00:59:26,345 --> 00:59:30,523
Start of this trip, I had a
whole world to choose from.

902
00:59:30,654 --> 00:59:33,265
Now--

903
00:59:33,395 --> 00:59:35,876
Now there's just me, huh?

904
00:59:36,007 --> 00:59:37,051
Just you and me.

905
00:59:57,550 --> 00:59:58,638
What's the answer?

906
00:59:58,769 --> 01:00:00,684
Huh?

907
01:00:00,814 --> 01:00:01,859
You're out of order, captain.

908
01:00:05,776 --> 01:00:07,647
Pretty fancy programming, doc.

909
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:09,562
That information is
for Colonel Price.

910
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:10,563
Why?

911
01:00:10,694 --> 01:00:13,087
We're all in the same mess.

912
01:00:13,218 --> 01:00:13,827
You're gonna love this.

913
01:00:17,396 --> 01:00:18,527
I know, Katie.

914
01:00:18,658 --> 01:00:21,966
You must be bitterly
disappointed.

915
01:00:22,096 --> 01:00:23,358
No, not at all.

916
01:00:23,489 --> 01:00:24,795
It's almost Biblical.

917
01:00:24,925 --> 01:00:28,233
A patriarch Adam,
fatherly, kindly.

918
01:00:28,363 --> 01:00:29,582
I think it's a fine choice.

919
01:00:35,544 --> 01:00:37,590
Amazing.

920
01:00:37,721 --> 01:00:41,594
The wisdom of an
unemotional machine.

921
01:00:41,725 --> 01:00:43,988
That man represents a
million years of knowledge

922
01:00:44,118 --> 01:00:46,033
for tomorrow's generation.

923
01:00:46,164 --> 01:00:46,991
You really buy it, huh?

924
01:00:50,298 --> 01:00:53,475
I don't care what the
damn computer says.

925
01:00:53,606 --> 01:00:58,872
There's only going to be one
decision, and I've made it.

926
01:00:59,003 --> 01:01:00,395
You with me, baby?

927
01:01:00,526 --> 01:01:01,222
You and me.

928
01:01:05,009 --> 01:01:07,402
I've waited long enough for you.

929
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:08,534
You're mine.

930
01:01:08,665 --> 01:01:11,189
[gasps]

931
01:01:11,319 --> 01:01:13,234
No one else is going to
get their hands on you.

932
01:01:13,365 --> 01:01:15,062
[shouts]

933
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:18,109
Colonel Price!

934
01:01:18,239 --> 01:01:19,110
Colonel Price!

935
01:01:27,684 --> 01:01:28,685
You're crazy, Kurt,
you know that?

936
01:01:28,815 --> 01:01:29,468
You're crazy!

937
01:01:29,598 --> 01:01:31,992
You don't want me.

938
01:01:32,123 --> 01:01:36,388
You and Perry-- it's disgusting.

939
01:01:36,518 --> 01:01:37,868
Come here.

940
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:38,869
Come here!

941
01:01:38,999 --> 01:01:40,087
Come here!

942
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:41,610
You asked for an
impersonal decision,

943
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,264
we must see the logic.

944
01:01:46,050 --> 01:01:49,357
Georgianne, I just
don't know what to say.

945
01:01:49,488 --> 01:01:51,925
I'm happy for you and Katie.

946
01:01:52,056 --> 01:01:53,884
Besides, I'm the oldest.

947
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,364
And that's it?

948
01:01:56,495 --> 01:01:57,844
And?

949
01:01:57,975 --> 01:01:59,019
The computer was programmed.

950
01:01:59,150 --> 01:02:00,368
It doesn't make errors.

951
01:02:00,499 --> 01:02:03,763
DANNY: It's manmade,
so it can make errors.

952
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:05,939
We've become
machine worshippers.

953
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,201
Don't you see it?

954
01:02:07,332 --> 01:02:08,812
We're so used to
flying on instruments,

955
01:02:08,942 --> 01:02:10,727
we don't know solid ground
when we're standing on it.

956
01:02:10,857 --> 01:02:12,467
What are you trying to say?

957
01:02:12,598 --> 01:02:16,036
He's trying to say that you and
Marion are very much in love.

958
01:02:16,167 --> 01:02:18,647
You're young and vital,
essential ingredients

959
01:02:18,778 --> 01:02:19,823
for an infant humanity.

960
01:02:29,223 --> 01:02:32,009
You're an animal!

961
01:02:32,139 --> 01:02:34,011
That's right, baby, an animal.

962
01:02:34,141 --> 01:02:35,490
We're all animals!

963
01:02:35,621 --> 01:02:36,491
No rules.

964
01:02:36,622 --> 01:02:38,015
No more [inaudible].

965
01:02:38,145 --> 01:02:38,929
Survival! [inaudible].

966
01:02:44,499 --> 01:02:46,850
Look out!

967
01:02:46,980 --> 01:02:50,767
[screaming]

968
01:03:21,841 --> 01:03:25,540
Kurt, Katie, would you
come up forward, please?

969
01:03:25,671 --> 01:03:27,325
[ON PA] Captain Mason,
Katie, do you hear me?

970
01:03:40,425 --> 01:03:41,295
My god!

971
01:03:46,431 --> 01:03:47,736
Katie.

972
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:48,520
Kurt.

973
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:53,481
Ohh.

974
01:04:11,282 --> 01:04:12,152
No, not that.

975
01:04:12,283 --> 01:04:13,545
What is it?

976
01:04:13,675 --> 01:04:15,460
Five year supply of
food concentrates.

977
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,679
They've thought of
everything, didn't they?

978
01:04:17,810 --> 01:04:20,073
Well, it's enough
for this load, anyway.

979
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:20,857
OK.

980
01:04:28,429 --> 01:04:29,691
Those are earth fragments.

981
01:04:29,822 --> 01:04:32,172
Entry should begin at once.

982
01:04:32,303 --> 01:04:34,087
Doc, we didn't reject
the computer's decision.

983
01:04:34,218 --> 01:04:35,088
Why should you?

984
01:04:35,219 --> 01:04:36,829
Well, I consider it settled.

985
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:41,007
You and Marion and Major Bronski
will carry on, right, Danny?

986
01:04:41,138 --> 01:04:42,791
Right.

987
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:44,489
Suppose I had stayed at home.

988
01:04:44,619 --> 01:04:46,317
At least this way I get
a chance to wave goodbye.

989
01:04:49,363 --> 01:04:49,973
I've gotta get my gear.

990
01:04:53,628 --> 01:04:58,851
It'll be all right,
because it has to be.

991
01:04:58,982 --> 01:05:00,070
COLONEL PRICE: Danny, hold it.

992
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:02,246
Nobody leaves this ship.

993
01:05:02,376 --> 01:05:03,247
It's all of us or nobody.

994
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:04,074
What?

995
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:05,031
You heard me.

996
01:05:05,162 --> 01:05:06,380
But that's suicide.

997
01:05:06,511 --> 01:05:07,207
The extra weight.

998
01:05:07,338 --> 01:05:07,991
We're going to chat.

999
01:05:08,121 --> 01:05:08,861
But colonel--

1000
01:05:08,992 --> 01:05:10,819
Hit the booster commit.

1001
01:05:10,950 --> 01:05:13,648
That's an order.

1002
01:05:13,779 --> 01:05:16,216
All right.

1003
01:05:16,347 --> 01:05:17,609
Committed.

1004
01:05:17,739 --> 01:05:19,350
OK.

1005
01:05:19,480 --> 01:05:22,048
In less than 10 minutes, the
last stage will blast free,

1006
01:05:22,179 --> 01:05:24,485
and we'll begin deceleration.

1007
01:05:24,616 --> 01:05:27,358
Everybody secure.

1008
01:05:27,488 --> 01:05:28,837
Look, the board!

1009
01:05:28,968 --> 01:05:31,188
We never got my
subsystem check out.

1010
01:05:31,318 --> 01:05:33,930
The circuit's been shorted
There's a misalignment

1011
01:05:34,060 --> 01:05:35,322
in the booster connector.

1012
01:05:35,453 --> 01:05:36,193
Let me get it, skipper.

1013
01:05:52,774 --> 01:05:54,298
He will be all right, won't he?

1014
01:05:54,428 --> 01:05:57,954
If the booster blasts free,
he could use it as a raft.

1015
01:05:58,084 --> 01:05:59,129
We're committed.

1016
01:05:59,259 --> 01:06:02,393
We can't stop a sequence.

1017
01:06:02,523 --> 01:06:03,916
You mean he can't
get back to the ship?

1018
01:06:04,047 --> 01:06:04,917
We'd be gone.

1019
01:06:09,487 --> 01:06:10,270
Fasten your straps.

1020
01:07:05,586 --> 01:07:06,457
Are you getting a green light?

1021
01:07:09,590 --> 01:07:10,548
Yes.

1022
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:12,419
It's not holding.

1023
01:07:12,550 --> 01:07:13,855
You've got four
minutes, Colonel.

1024
01:07:17,685 --> 01:07:18,686
Don?

1025
01:07:18,817 --> 01:07:19,513
Dr. Perry?

1026
01:07:19,644 --> 01:07:20,645
We're Georgianna?

1027
01:07:20,775 --> 01:07:21,428
She's gone!

1028
01:07:24,257 --> 01:07:25,650
COLONEL PRICE: What's
the problem, Danny?

1029
01:07:25,780 --> 01:07:28,087
I'm trying, skipper,
but I haven't

1030
01:07:28,218 --> 01:07:30,698
got enough mass to swing it.

1031
01:07:30,829 --> 01:07:31,699
It's really jammed.

1032
01:07:31,830 --> 01:07:33,136
Keep trying, Danny.

1033
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:34,050
Keep trying.

1034
01:07:57,986 --> 01:07:58,900
That's it, Danny.

1035
01:07:59,031 --> 01:08:00,554
You got it.

1036
01:08:22,620 --> 01:08:24,796
We made it.

1037
01:08:24,926 --> 01:08:27,103
Oh thank god.

1038
01:08:27,233 --> 01:08:29,105
Amen to that.

1039
01:08:29,235 --> 01:08:32,282
100 million miles from
home, and we ran out of gas.

1040
01:08:35,241 --> 01:08:37,243
Georgie, why did you do it?

1041
01:08:37,374 --> 01:08:40,028
You needed help, didn't you?

1042
01:08:40,159 --> 01:08:40,812
I guess so.

1043
01:08:43,815 --> 01:08:47,732
This is like sitting in Central
Park on a warm summer's night.

1044
01:08:47,862 --> 01:08:50,909
Have you ever been
to Central Park?

1045
01:08:51,039 --> 01:08:53,303
No, Danny, I have never
been in Central Park.

1046
01:08:53,433 --> 01:08:55,435
It was a beautiful place.

1047
01:08:55,566 --> 01:09:00,179
It started at 59th
Street and-- hey, look!

1048
01:09:03,095 --> 01:09:04,836
They're just meteorites.

1049
01:09:04,966 --> 01:09:05,793
No, no, over there!

1050
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:24,986
It's a miracle, a
beautiful, floating miracle.

1051
01:09:25,117 --> 01:09:25,770
Come on!

1052
01:09:34,779 --> 01:09:35,649
How's the fuel?

1053
01:09:35,780 --> 01:09:36,433
A-OK.

1054
01:09:39,349 --> 01:09:40,001
We're gonna make it.

1055
01:10:16,212 --> 01:10:17,691
DANNY: Georgie, it's Russian.

1056
01:10:26,178 --> 01:10:28,049
She's got solar cells.

1057
01:10:28,180 --> 01:10:30,182
That means we've
got electricity.

1058
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,014
MAJOR BRONSKI: [inaudible]
is [inaudible] too.

1059
01:10:40,540 --> 01:10:42,977
DANNY: I don't care if
it's the Flying Dutchman.

1060
01:10:43,108 --> 01:10:44,762
Let's go inside to
repair the ring.

1061
01:10:44,892 --> 01:10:45,545
Come on.

1062
01:11:14,966 --> 01:11:17,969
We've got some excess baggage.

1063
01:11:18,099 --> 01:11:20,232
MAJOR BRONSKI: What is it?

1064
01:11:20,363 --> 01:11:21,755
DANNY: Looks like a
countryman of yours.

1065
01:12:24,644 --> 01:12:28,169
Well, at least we've
got some oxygen

1066
01:12:28,300 --> 01:12:31,651
and emergency power from the
batteries, what's left of them.

1067
01:12:31,782 --> 01:12:34,132
There's no main power.

1068
01:12:34,262 --> 01:14:56,709
That means-- Hey,
we've got juice.

1069
01:14:56,840 --> 01:14:58,972
We're on the air.

1070
01:14:59,103 --> 01:15:00,713
Oh, Danny.

1071
01:15:00,844 --> 01:15:03,324
I knew such a miracle
couldn't be wasted.

1072
01:15:03,455 --> 01:15:04,848
We're going to live!

1073
01:15:04,978 --> 01:15:07,024
How's that for
long shots, honey?

1074
01:15:07,154 --> 01:15:08,329
Somebody's betting on us.

1075
01:15:08,460 --> 01:15:10,375
We've got to win.

1076
01:15:10,506 --> 01:15:13,639
Those systems ought to
come on now like crazy.

1077
01:15:13,770 --> 01:15:17,991
But first, let's see if
we've got a home to go to.

1078
01:15:18,122 --> 01:15:22,909
I think I can milk 108 megs out
of this rig, even in Russian.

1079
01:15:23,040 --> 01:15:26,739
Hello, Astra, this is the
Izvestia II calling Astra.

1080
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:27,958
Do you read me, Astra?

1081
01:15:28,088 --> 01:15:28,741
Over.

1082
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:36,096
I don't believe it.

1083
01:15:42,668 --> 01:15:44,191
Danny!

1084
01:15:44,322 --> 01:15:46,324
Where are you?

1085
01:15:46,454 --> 01:15:48,065
This is Astra calling.

1086
01:15:48,195 --> 01:15:48,848
Izvestia II?

1087
01:16:02,819 --> 01:16:04,168
Don't give up, Danny.

1088
01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:05,648
Keep trying.

1089
01:16:05,778 --> 01:16:07,171
Izvestia II to Astra.

1090
01:16:07,301 --> 01:16:07,954
Come in, please.

1091
01:16:08,085 --> 01:16:08,738
Over.

1092
01:16:12,959 --> 01:16:13,917
Hello, Astra.

1093
01:16:14,047 --> 01:16:15,005
Are you there?

1094
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:16,267
Come in, Astra.

1095
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:17,268
Answer me.

1096
01:16:17,398 --> 01:16:19,879
Anybody, please.

1097
01:16:20,010 --> 01:16:24,492
Izvestia II calling
Astra, come in, please.

1098
01:16:24,623 --> 01:16:26,103
Come in, Danny!

1099
01:16:26,233 --> 01:16:30,281
Come in you wonderful,
crazy-- do you hear me, over?

1100
01:16:30,411 --> 01:16:32,326
DANNY [ON RADIO] :
Our craft is operable.

1101
01:16:32,457 --> 01:16:35,895
We need guidance for entry.

1102
01:16:36,026 --> 01:16:37,680
We read your signal, Astra.

1103
01:16:37,810 --> 01:16:40,204
It's faint, but we
can beam in on it.

1104
01:16:40,334 --> 01:16:41,205
Keep it coming.

1105
01:16:41,335 --> 01:16:42,467
We're on our way.

1106
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,078
I'm switching to manual control.

1107
01:17:26,990 --> 01:17:28,644
What?

1108
01:17:28,774 --> 01:17:30,167
COLONEL PRICE [ON RADIO]:
Danny, where are you?

1109
01:17:38,436 --> 01:17:40,133
Georgie, activate
the view screen.

1110
01:17:40,264 --> 01:17:41,613
I want to see where
I'm going if I'm

1111
01:17:41,744 --> 01:17:44,572
taking this baby in by hand.

1112
01:17:44,703 --> 01:17:48,054
I'm activating the
image stabilizer systems.

1113
01:17:48,185 --> 01:17:50,013
We're set on wide scan.

1114
01:17:50,143 --> 01:17:52,842
Should be able to get
reception from Venus shortly.

1115
01:17:59,544 --> 01:18:00,458
DANNY [ON RADIO] : Hello, Astra.

1116
01:18:00,588 --> 01:18:03,417
All our systems are go.

1117
01:18:03,548 --> 01:18:05,376
I'm reading your
signal, but I'm not

1118
01:18:05,506 --> 01:18:07,291
getting any audio transmission.

1119
01:18:07,421 --> 01:18:09,249
Astra, I know you can read us.

1120
01:18:09,380 --> 01:18:12,339
In two seconds, we're going
to boost our reception.

1121
01:18:23,873 --> 01:18:25,744
Stand by to confirm
you're holding

1122
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,703
us on beam for all our entry.

1123
01:18:33,273 --> 01:18:34,100
Do you read?

1124
01:18:34,231 --> 01:18:34,927
Over.

1125
01:18:39,279 --> 01:18:40,933
Astra, Astra, what's happened?

1126
01:18:41,064 --> 01:18:42,239
Where are you?

1127
01:18:42,369 --> 01:18:46,417
We're picking up no
signals from you.

1128
01:18:46,547 --> 01:18:47,374
No, it's OK.

1129
01:18:47,505 --> 01:18:48,898
We've got their signal.

1130
01:18:49,028 --> 01:18:49,812
Or do we?

1131
01:19:21,408 --> 01:19:22,018
Astra, where are you?

1132
01:19:22,148 --> 01:19:23,976
Astra.

1133
01:19:24,107 --> 01:19:25,238
DISEMBODIED VOICE:
Last of man, listen.

1134
01:19:34,378 --> 01:19:37,990
The craft you are attempting
to communicate with no longer

1135
01:19:38,121 --> 01:19:39,731
exists.

1136
01:19:39,862 --> 01:19:44,083
Your sister craft
no longer exists.

1137
01:19:44,214 --> 01:19:47,652
The signal you are
following is a warning.

1138
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,394
Had you been able to
decipher its meaning,

1139
01:19:50,524 --> 01:19:53,919
you would not have attempted
to trespass on our world.

1140
01:19:58,358 --> 01:19:59,446
Your world?

1141
01:19:59,577 --> 01:20:00,273
Who are you?

1142
01:20:13,025 --> 01:20:15,723
DISEMBODIED VOICE: We all the
collective minds of the world

1143
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:18,291
your craft now orbits.

1144
01:20:18,422 --> 01:20:21,033
Easy enough for you to
know that during the span

1145
01:20:21,164 --> 01:20:24,471
of our evolution
our civilization

1146
01:20:24,602 --> 01:20:28,214
has witnessed the birth and
death of worlds and suns

1147
01:20:28,345 --> 01:20:28,998
untold.

1148
01:20:34,438 --> 01:20:35,395
But enough.

1149
01:20:35,526 --> 01:20:36,832
Your time is short.

1150
01:20:36,962 --> 01:20:39,095
You may not enter our world.

1151
01:20:39,225 --> 01:20:42,228
We have witnessed the
self-destructive powers of

1152
01:20:42,359 --> 01:20:45,188
the green planet you can earth.

1153
01:20:45,318 --> 01:20:48,147
We have no malice toward you.

1154
01:20:48,278 --> 01:20:50,410
You have destroyed your
place in the universe.

1155
01:21:08,385 --> 01:21:12,606
Last of man, listen of
this we will tell you.

1156
01:21:12,737 --> 01:21:14,870
Your journey will continue.

1157
01:21:15,000 --> 01:21:18,743
Something very
strange and very great

1158
01:21:18,874 --> 01:21:21,746
awaits you beyond the
rim of the universe.

1159
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,924
And now, last of man,
your journey will begin.

1160
01:21:30,233 --> 01:21:32,539
[explosion]

1161
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:39,546
