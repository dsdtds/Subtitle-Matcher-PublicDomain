1
00:01:29,832 --> 00:01:32,494
I'm afraid you're on
a wild goose chase, Mr. Chan.

2
00:01:32,602 --> 00:01:34,900
Have sometimes caught wild goose.

3
00:01:35,004 --> 00:01:38,906
Well, if you ask me, there's something fishy
about the whole business.

4
00:01:39,008 --> 00:01:42,273
A man walks out on a fortune
seven years ago.

5
00:01:42,378 --> 00:01:47,213
Then all of a sudden,
he appears from nowhere to claim it.

6
00:01:47,316 --> 00:01:50,649
A little tough on the Colby heirs
if he's alive.

7
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:54,086
- Tough on Allen Colby if dead.
- Yeah.

8
00:02:02,365 --> 00:02:05,095
Ah. They're bringing him up now.

9
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:23,018
Get back.

10
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:36,330
Take in on the winch.

11
00:02:41,203 --> 00:02:43,330
All right, swing him aboard.

12
00:02:45,007 --> 00:02:47,271
All right, get him down there.

13
00:02:56,185 --> 00:02:59,348
Body not that of Allen Colby.

14
00:02:59,455 --> 00:03:02,481
- Well, I guess that ends it.
- Not so certain.

15
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:07,589
Passenger list indicate
30 persons on board.

16
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:10,427
Twenty-seven rescued by lifeboats.

17
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:13,058
Two bodies recovered today.

18
00:03:13,169 --> 00:03:16,332
Twenty-seven plus two make 29.

19
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:19,101
Leave one body missing.

20
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:23,338
Maybe Allen Colby escape
by clinging to wreckage.

21
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,971
Well, if he did,
the sharks got him by now.

22
00:03:26,082 --> 00:03:28,414
You can't drift around
in these waters for two weeks.

23
00:03:28,517 --> 00:03:31,850
May have been picked up
by boat without radio.

24
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:34,821
Must not overlook any possibility.

25
00:03:38,861 --> 00:03:41,022
Mr. Chan.

26
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:43,928
- I found this in one of the bunks.
- Thank you so much.

27
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,569
Initials A.C.

28
00:03:48,838 --> 00:03:50,806
Allen Colby.

29
00:04:21,637 --> 00:04:24,970
As soon as you get Duke aboard,
get under way!

30
00:04:25,074 --> 00:04:27,201
How soon we make port?

31
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:29,334
Oh, a couple of hours.

32
00:04:29,445 --> 00:04:31,504
May send radiogram, please?

33
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:35,380
Sure. They can relay it
from the land station.

34
00:04:37,687 --> 00:04:39,587
What do you wanna say?

35
00:04:39,689 --> 00:04:44,353
To Mrs. Henrietta Lowell,
San Francisco.

36
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:48,226
Fate of Allen Colby still uncertain.

37
00:04:50,466 --> 00:04:56,234
Leaving Honolulu at once
on new clipper airship...

38
00:04:56,338 --> 00:05:00,399
to continue investigation
on mainland.

39
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,069
Sign Charlie Chan, please.

40
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:16,858
"D."

41
00:05:18,728 --> 00:05:20,696
"E."

42
00:05:22,531 --> 00:05:24,499
"A."

43
00:05:27,503 --> 00:05:29,903
"D." Dead.

44
00:05:32,241 --> 00:05:34,835
There can be no doubt, Baxter.

45
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:39,074
Allen is dead.
It was a message from his father.

46
00:05:39,181 --> 00:05:42,639
To be perfectly frank, madam...

47
00:05:42,752 --> 00:05:45,516
- this sort of thing makes me quite creepy.
- Oh, nonsense.

48
00:05:48,891 --> 00:05:51,655
A radiogram, Mrs. Lowell.

49
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,389
We haven't finished yet.
Sit down.

50
00:05:58,968 --> 00:06:01,061
Hand me the telephone.

51
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:09,844
Oh, get off the wire, Alice.
You can talk to Dick some other time.

52
00:06:09,945 --> 00:06:13,972
All right, Mother, in just a second.
Dick, I'll have to go now.

53
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:15,983
All right.
Now remember, darling...

54
00:06:16,085 --> 00:06:19,054
we've got a date tonight if the chief
doesn't send me out on a story.

55
00:06:19,155 --> 00:06:24,354
Well, I like that. You think more
of your old newspaper than you do me.

56
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:29,295
Well, Dick, I simply must hang up now.
Mother wants to use the phone.

57
00:06:29,398 --> 00:06:31,730
Of course I do.

58
00:06:31,834 --> 00:06:33,802
Good-bye.

59
00:06:35,971 --> 00:06:38,906
- Call Mr. Phelps's office for me.
- Yes, ma'am.

60
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:44,377
- What is the wire?
- Another radiogram from Charlie Chan.

61
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:48,177
- He's arriving sometime today.
- The line's busy, ma'am.

62
00:06:48,284 --> 00:06:51,412
Try again. And remind me
to call Professor Bowan.

63
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,149
I want to tell him that we're holding
a séance tonight at 8:30.

64
00:06:55,257 --> 00:06:58,021
If you have nothing else to do,
take some flowers out to Colby House...

65
00:06:58,127 --> 00:07:00,425
and tell Ulrich
to have everything ready.

66
00:07:00,529 --> 00:07:02,827
- All right, Mother.
- Do you want Baxter to help you?

67
00:07:02,932 --> 00:07:06,527
No, thanks. I'll shanghai Dick.

68
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,935
Hello, Mr. Phelps?
Just one moment. Mrs. Lowell.

69
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:12,940
Hello, Warren.

70
00:07:13,042 --> 00:07:17,240
It's your mother.
Yes, Mrs. Lowell.

71
00:07:17,346 --> 00:07:19,246
He's arriving today?

72
00:07:20,749 --> 00:07:23,513
Yes, everything concerning
the estate is in order.

73
00:07:23,619 --> 00:07:27,521
I've been going over matters with your son-in-law.
He and Mrs. Gage are here now.

74
00:07:29,158 --> 00:07:33,026
Certainly, I'll tell them to be there.
At 8:30.

75
00:07:33,128 --> 00:07:36,393
Yes, I'll come too. Good-bye.

76
00:07:36,498 --> 00:07:38,557
Was she talking about Allen?

77
00:07:38,667 --> 00:07:41,864
No, Charlie Chan.
He's arriving this afternoon.

78
00:07:41,971 --> 00:07:44,337
He must have definite news
about Allen.

79
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:47,034
Otherwise, he wouldn't be coming
all the way from Honolulu.

80
00:07:47,142 --> 00:07:49,303
I don't see why Mother
had to drag him into this.

81
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:51,641
Well, you can hardly blame her
for being worried.

82
00:07:51,747 --> 00:07:54,477
If Allen is alive, it places
a great responsibility on her.

83
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:58,246
But from what you've said,
it places a great responsibility on all of us.

84
00:07:58,354 --> 00:08:02,154
We'll have to turn the estate over to him
and account for every penny we've spent.

85
00:08:02,258 --> 00:08:04,453
Well, after all,
it was his father's money.

86
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:06,494
But Mother was Uncle Bernard's sister.

87
00:08:06,595 --> 00:08:09,393
Regardless of Allen,
she should be entitled to something.

88
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:13,059
Unfortunately not,
if Allen is alive.

89
00:09:19,335 --> 00:09:21,303
Ulrich.!

90
00:09:22,871 --> 00:09:25,203
Ulrich.!

91
00:09:25,307 --> 00:09:27,275
Ulrich!

92
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:32,647
Ulrich!

93
00:10:33,842 --> 00:10:36,743
- Hello, Alice.
- Hmm. Where were you
when I called at the office?

94
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:39,177
Now wait a minute.
I had to go out on a story.

95
00:10:39,281 --> 00:10:41,613
So I phoned your mother,
and she said you were coming here.

96
00:10:41,717 --> 00:10:45,778
- Well, I wanted you to help me with these flowers.
- More spook business tonight?

97
00:10:45,888 --> 00:10:50,120
Oh, please don't kid about it, Dick.
At least not when Mother's around.

98
00:10:50,225 --> 00:10:52,284
I'm always nervous
when I come to this old house.

99
00:10:52,394 --> 00:10:57,263
Oh, don't worry. I won't let the old bogeyman
get you. I want you myself.

100
00:10:57,366 --> 00:11:00,927
Even if Allen came back and claimed
all the money and I was poor?

101
00:11:01,036 --> 00:11:03,937
Say, when I marry,
I don't expect to work for a living.

102
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:06,599
Aw, go away.
You're just a fortune hunter.

103
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,938
How'd you guess it?

104
00:11:09,044 --> 00:11:10,944
Dick, what's that?

105
00:11:11,046 --> 00:11:12,946
Well, it's not a ghost!

106
00:11:19,054 --> 00:11:21,682
- Oh, it's Lucifer.

107
00:11:21,790 --> 00:11:23,690
Something must have frightened him.

108
00:11:23,792 --> 00:11:27,228
There, Alice. You have the solution
to all ghost stories.

109
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:29,422
Not to all the things
that happen in this house.

110
00:11:29,531 --> 00:11:33,524
You know, I don't see why your mother doesn't
have this old squirrel's cage torn down.

111
00:11:33,635 --> 00:11:36,297
She's too devout a believer
in psychic research.

112
00:11:36,405 --> 00:11:39,431
Why, this place means as much to her
as it did to Uncle Bernard.

113
00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:41,441
Yeah, and he was a little cracked.

114
00:11:41,543 --> 00:11:44,637
Oh, don't say that, Dick.
He believed in it.

115
00:11:44,746 --> 00:11:48,341
That's why he rebuilt this house
with all these funny rooms.

116
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:50,782
So the poor spirits
could have a home.

117
00:11:50,886 --> 00:11:53,878
Come on. Let's get out of here
and go somewheres a little more cheerful.

118
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:58,016
Not yet. I have to arrange those flowers
for tonight's séance.

119
00:11:58,127 --> 00:12:00,322
And you're going to help me.

120
00:12:04,666 --> 00:12:08,432
I very rarely visit the old house, sir,
since Mr. Colby died.

121
00:12:08,537 --> 00:12:10,528
It was only because
of your late arrival...

122
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,005
that Mrs. Lowell told me
to bring you here.

123
00:12:13,108 --> 00:12:16,339
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's a pleasure, sir.

124
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:18,675
I don't mind admitting
to you frankly, sir...

125
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:21,476
that I don't feel at all myself
in this atmosphere.

126
00:12:21,583 --> 00:12:24,017
- No?
- No, sir.

127
00:12:24,119 --> 00:12:28,920
There's a tinge of the graveyard
which positively awes me.

128
00:12:29,024 --> 00:12:33,085
Yes. Mysterious shadows of night
cling to old house...

129
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:35,720
like moss on tombstone?

130
00:12:35,831 --> 00:12:40,700
Quite right— Quite right, sir.

131
00:12:40,802 --> 00:12:44,636
That, sir, is the—
is the front door.

132
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,268
The—The back door
is... at the rear.

133
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:53,405
Most interesting.
Shall we enter by front door?

134
00:12:53,515 --> 00:12:56,450
Yes. Yes.

135
00:13:16,572 --> 00:13:18,540
This way, sir.

136
00:13:20,142 --> 00:13:22,702
The family will be waiting
for you in here, sir.

137
00:13:22,811 --> 00:13:26,406
These are the accounts
you spoke of, Mrs. Lowell.

138
00:13:26,515 --> 00:13:28,506
No, not now.

139
00:13:28,617 --> 00:13:32,280
- Mr. Chan.
- Oh. I'm so glad you arrived, Charlie.

140
00:13:32,387 --> 00:13:35,356
I knew I could depend on you.
You know everyone here.

141
00:13:35,457 --> 00:13:38,358
- Good evening, Mr. Chan.
- Greetings at end of journey...

142
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:41,122
like refreshing rain
after long drought.

143
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,597
Yes, yes, Mr. Chan,
but let's get to your report.

144
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:47,464
Yes, Charlie.
What about Allen?

145
00:13:47,569 --> 00:13:49,469
Uh—

146
00:14:17,799 --> 00:14:20,768
Then it's your belief
that Allen is still alive?

147
00:14:20,869 --> 00:14:25,602
Cannot be certain but, if so,
suspect life may be in danger.

148
00:14:25,707 --> 00:14:29,643
- Now why do you say that?
- Observe.

149
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,680
More than one attempt
made on Allen Colby's life.

150
00:14:32,781 --> 00:14:36,683
Just a scheme to create an impression.
This fellow may be an impostor.

151
00:14:36,785 --> 00:14:39,481
Correction, please.

152
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:43,581
Passport visaed by French
and British consuls...

153
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,058
indicate he is real Allen Colby.

154
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:50,120
Then why did he wait all these years
before communicating with his family?

155
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:53,065
Investigation prove Allen Colby...

156
00:14:53,168 --> 00:14:55,966
enlisted in French Foreign Legion...

157
00:14:56,071 --> 00:14:58,198
was taken prisoner by Riffs.

158
00:14:58,307 --> 00:15:00,366
Escaped only recently.

159
00:15:00,475 --> 00:15:02,568
Could not have communicated sooner.

160
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:06,705
Unless he was drowned, we can expect him
to appear at any time to claim the estate?

161
00:15:06,815 --> 00:15:10,512
He has a right to the money, more than we have.

162
00:15:10,619 --> 00:15:12,814
What is it, Ulrich?

163
00:15:12,921 --> 00:15:17,483
Uh, Professor Bowan and Carlotta
are ready to start the séance.

164
00:15:17,592 --> 00:15:21,323
Tell them we'll be there in a moment,
and see that we're not disturbed.

165
00:15:29,271 --> 00:15:33,173
I can't stand that man!
He's forever staring at me.

166
00:15:33,275 --> 00:15:36,870
- Why don't we get rid ofhim?
- We've gone over that before, Janice.

167
00:15:36,978 --> 00:15:39,606
- Shall we go into the other room?
- Perhaps Mr. Chan would rather wait here.

168
00:15:39,715 --> 00:15:43,116
- He may not be interested in a séance.
- I'm sure he will be.

169
00:15:46,121 --> 00:15:49,921
Tonight Professor Bowan has promised us
a message concerning Allen.

170
00:15:50,025 --> 00:15:54,291
- I would like to have you present.
- Would appreciate very much.

171
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:59,527
- Chinese people interested in all things psychic.
- Yes.

172
00:16:01,903 --> 00:16:04,838
Have they started
the séance yet, Ulrich?

173
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:07,431
- They're just about to begin, miss.
- Thanks.

174
00:16:07,542 --> 00:16:13,105
You're always causing me grief.
If we'd been late, Mother would have been furious.

175
00:16:17,486 --> 00:16:21,445
- Is everything ready, Baxter?
- Yes, ma'am.

176
00:16:21,556 --> 00:16:24,184
- Sorry I'm late, Mother.
- All my fault, Mrs. Lowell.

177
00:16:24,292 --> 00:16:26,226
Say, you're Mr. Chan, aren't you?

178
00:16:26,328 --> 00:16:29,456
- Humbly acknowledge name.
- Glad to meet you. I've heard a lot about you.

179
00:16:29,564 --> 00:16:31,464
I'm Dick Williams of the Globe.

180
00:16:31,566 --> 00:16:34,831
- Anything I can print on the Colby case?
- There's nothing for publication.

181
00:16:34,936 --> 00:16:37,769
I've asked you repeatedly
to consider our family affairs confidential.

182
00:16:37,873 --> 00:16:41,604
- Yes, but—
- Mr. Gage very wise.

183
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:44,941
Best place for skeleton
is in family closet.

184
00:16:45,046 --> 00:16:48,345
Thank you.
Nothing to say.

185
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:50,748
Come, Charlie.

186
00:16:57,092 --> 00:17:01,461
This is Professor Bowan,
our adviser in psychic research.

187
00:17:01,563 --> 00:17:03,997
And this is our medium, Carlotta.

188
00:17:04,099 --> 00:17:05,999
So pleased.

189
00:17:06,101 --> 00:17:09,969
Most fortunate gift
to be able to cross bridge...

190
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:13,768
to dwelling place of honorable ancestors
before arriving.

191
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,775
Shall we begin?

192
00:17:15,877 --> 00:17:19,313
If you'll take your usual seats,
we will commence.

193
00:17:25,554 --> 00:17:27,488
Take this chair, Charlie.

194
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:31,047
- Will that be all right, Professor?
- Quite all right.

195
00:17:31,159 --> 00:17:36,119
Tonight I wish to ask
for your special concentration.

196
00:17:36,231 --> 00:17:40,895
We will try to bring word
of Allen Colby from the beyond.

197
00:17:41,002 --> 00:17:43,300
It may be difficult.

198
00:17:43,405 --> 00:17:47,068
We shall ask his father,
Bernard Colby...

199
00:17:47,175 --> 00:17:50,838
- who has been our guide before, to assist us.

200
00:17:52,347 --> 00:17:55,248
We will pause a moment
in meditation.

201
00:18:15,303 --> 00:18:17,567
Mr. Gage, will you
turn down the lights?

202
00:18:30,385 --> 00:18:32,853
There is a presence here.

203
00:18:35,757 --> 00:18:38,089
He has a message for Mrs. Lowell.

204
00:18:42,664 --> 00:18:45,963
It is her brother, Bernard.

205
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,401
He says that Allen
is there with him.

206
00:18:55,343 --> 00:18:57,641
He is happy.

207
00:19:00,048 --> 00:19:02,744
He wants to come to you.

208
00:19:06,888 --> 00:19:09,982
- Stop it!
- Lights! Turn on the lights!

209
00:19:16,865 --> 00:19:20,460
Allen Colby... murdered.

210
00:19:25,206 --> 00:19:27,299
Notify police immediately.

211
00:19:27,409 --> 00:19:29,172
Touch nothing...

212
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:34,115
until police arrive.

213
00:19:38,453 --> 00:19:41,047
- Thanks for your information, Mr. Chan.
- You welcome.

214
00:19:41,156 --> 00:19:45,525
You know, what beats me is how Allen Colby
got ashore without our getting wind of it.

215
00:19:45,627 --> 00:19:48,323
Somebody knew it. That's how
he trapped Colby here and finished him off.

216
00:19:48,430 --> 00:19:50,330
He must have been trapped, all right.

217
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:54,994
You know, Allen was the type of fellow who
could have defended himself. A knife in the back.

218
00:19:55,103 --> 00:19:59,005
If strength were all,
tiger would not fear scorpion.

219
00:19:59,107 --> 00:20:03,510
- Not a sign of fingerprints.
- Oh, he used gloves or a handkerchief.

220
00:20:03,612 --> 00:20:06,479
This fellow was smart enough for that.

221
00:20:09,217 --> 00:20:12,778
Have observed former resting place
of murder weapon?

222
00:20:12,887 --> 00:20:15,856
I've already checked that.
No fingerprints there either.

223
00:20:15,957 --> 00:20:19,415
- What did you find, Doctor?
- Knife pierced right ventricle of the heart.

224
00:20:20,862 --> 00:20:23,194
- He's been dead about four hours.
- You want an autopsy?

225
00:20:23,298 --> 00:20:25,664
Oh, no, not necessary.
See you in the morning.

226
00:20:25,767 --> 00:20:29,828
- Oh, Harris, got the rest
of them in the other room?
- Yes, sir.

227
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:33,533
Come along, Mr. Chan.
You too, Williams.

228
00:20:33,642 --> 00:20:36,338
I want to talk to everyone
who was present here tonight.

229
00:20:38,213 --> 00:20:42,240
Bowan, you must've been pretty sure
Colby was dead when you started your séance.

230
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:45,581
That isn't true. We were merely seeking
a message concerning him.

231
00:20:45,687 --> 00:20:47,587
Just before
this terrible thing happened...

232
00:20:47,689 --> 00:20:51,090
I felt a strange
new presence about me.

233
00:20:51,192 --> 00:20:54,889
I knew we were in contact
with Allen Colby's spirit.

234
00:20:54,996 --> 00:20:58,090
And with his body
hidden behind the panel...

235
00:20:58,199 --> 00:21:00,861
it was easy for his spirit
to get here, wasn't it?

236
00:21:00,969 --> 00:21:03,961
Pardon interruption, please.

237
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:08,509
May ask cause of Allen Colby's
separation from family?

238
00:21:08,610 --> 00:21:11,943
Oh, certainly, Charlie.
There had been a quarrel...

239
00:21:12,047 --> 00:21:16,313
or rather a misunderstanding
between Allen and his father.

240
00:21:16,418 --> 00:21:20,752
You see, Allen didn't share
our belief in psychic things.

241
00:21:20,855 --> 00:21:22,755
Is this digging
into family affairs necessary?

242
00:21:22,857 --> 00:21:24,457
It is when we're looking for facts.
If all I wanted was a motive...

243
00:21:24,492 --> 00:21:26,058
It is when we're looking for facts.
If all I wanted was a motive...

244
00:21:26,161 --> 00:21:28,595
I wouldn't have to go any further
than the Lowell family.

245
00:21:28,697 --> 00:21:30,631
What do you mean by that?

246
00:21:30,732 --> 00:21:32,632
Simple enough, isn't it?

247
00:21:32,734 --> 00:21:36,602
Allen Colby alive meant
the loss of a fortune for all of you.

248
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:39,868
So sorry again to interrupt. Uh—

249
00:21:39,974 --> 00:21:43,740
Money from Colby estate
used for psychic research?

250
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,040
As executor of the estate, I can answer that.

251
00:21:46,147 --> 00:21:50,345
Only such sums were used
as Mrs. Lowell saw fit to donate.

252
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:53,444
And that would have ended, too,
if Colby had returned?

253
00:21:53,555 --> 00:21:57,389
Yes, I suppose so.

254
00:21:57,492 --> 00:22:01,986
Were you here earlier today?

255
00:22:02,097 --> 00:22:05,760
Why, yes. I stopped by
Ulrich's cottage about 6:00...

256
00:22:05,867 --> 00:22:09,098
to remind him to have everything
in order for the séance.

257
00:22:09,204 --> 00:22:11,798
You were here at house?

258
00:22:11,906 --> 00:22:17,208
No. I've had a slight cold, and I left
almost immediately to take care of it.

259
00:22:19,581 --> 00:22:23,244
- Is that right?
- As far as I know, it is.

260
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:29,452
Pardon undue curiosity.

261
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:33,493
- You were here all day?
- That's what I get paid for.

262
00:22:33,595 --> 00:22:37,463
Strange you did not know
Allen Colby had arrived.

263
00:22:37,565 --> 00:22:41,228
I said once— I didn't.

264
00:22:41,336 --> 00:22:45,432
Who else beside Professor Bowan
visit here today?

265
00:22:46,741 --> 00:22:48,709
Why, I was here.

266
00:22:50,145 --> 00:22:52,477
- You also?
- What for?

267
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:56,038
He came here to meet me
when I brought the flowers for the séance.

268
00:22:56,151 --> 00:22:58,847
- What time was that?
- Uh, I was here first.

269
00:22:58,953 --> 00:23:02,787
Alice came in at 5:30. I'm sure of the time
because I noticed the clock was fast...

270
00:23:02,891 --> 00:23:05,485
and I was about to reset it.

271
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:20,740
Strange.
Ancient clock tell very latest time now.

272
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:23,538
Someone must have fixed it!

273
00:23:27,015 --> 00:23:31,315
Well, who reset the clock?

274
00:23:31,419 --> 00:23:33,387
You don't think I'm lying, do you?

275
00:23:33,488 --> 00:23:36,252
You arrived at what time, please?

276
00:23:36,357 --> 00:23:38,257
About a quarter past 5:00.

277
00:23:38,359 --> 00:23:41,089
And the murder took place
around 5:00.

278
00:23:41,196 --> 00:23:44,393
I can tell you, Morton,
there was nothing wrong when I was here.

279
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:49,092
You and Miss Lowell were planning
to get married shortly, weren't you?

280
00:23:49,204 --> 00:23:51,570
Why, yes. What of it?

281
00:23:51,673 --> 00:23:53,573
Congratulations.

282
00:23:53,675 --> 00:23:56,576
- Haven't we had enough of this inquisition?
- For tonight, yes.

283
00:23:56,678 --> 00:24:00,580
But until this matter is settled, be on hand
to give the authorities any help they need.

284
00:24:00,682 --> 00:24:02,912
That's all.

285
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:05,008
Excuse, please.

286
00:24:07,589 --> 00:24:11,150
- Ah, a headache for the police department.
- Yes.

287
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:13,318
Have you any ideas, Mr. Chan?

288
00:24:13,428 --> 00:24:16,022
Solve mystery, cure headache.

289
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,963
Okay, we'll split a box of aspirin.

290
00:24:19,067 --> 00:24:21,194
Oh, Harris.
See you in the morning?

291
00:24:21,302 --> 00:24:24,863
Thank you.
Will bring aspirin.

292
00:24:24,973 --> 00:24:28,909
- Ambulance here?
- They've just arrived, sir.
The men are coming in now.

293
00:24:37,085 --> 00:24:40,987
- Almost finished?
- Yes, last plate.

294
00:24:41,089 --> 00:24:45,856
I guess I'll have to quit. Pretty hard
to catch up with murderers these days, Mr. Chan...

295
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,793
especially when they don't
leave their signatures.

296
00:24:48,897 --> 00:24:52,333
That's what I call fingerprints—
signatures.

297
00:24:52,433 --> 00:24:57,370
But when they do leave them,
it's just like signing their confession.

298
00:24:57,472 --> 00:25:00,635
Yes, fingerprints very valuable...

299
00:25:00,742 --> 00:25:03,836
if detective can catch
owner of fingers.

300
00:25:03,945 --> 00:25:08,075
That's right.
Found anything interesting?

301
00:25:08,182 --> 00:25:11,242
As son Lee would say— play hunch.

302
00:25:11,352 --> 00:25:13,980
- Charlie.!
- Excuse, please.

303
00:25:21,796 --> 00:25:23,923
Oh, there you are.
Come along with us.

304
00:25:24,032 --> 00:25:25,932
We'll put you up at the house.

305
00:25:26,034 --> 00:25:31,097
Thank you so much,
but with your permission, may spend night here?

306
00:25:31,205 --> 00:25:33,605
- Here?
- Yes.

307
00:25:33,708 --> 00:25:36,302
Would like to make
more complete investigation.

308
00:25:36,411 --> 00:25:40,677
Oh, very well. As you wish.
Baxter, prepare one of the bedrooms.

309
00:25:40,782 --> 00:25:44,377
And you had better remain
here with Mr. Chan tonight.

310
00:25:44,485 --> 00:25:48,012
- Oh, all— all night, ma'am?
- Certainly!

311
00:25:48,122 --> 00:25:51,387
I'll send something over for your breakfast
in the morning, Charlie.

312
00:25:51,492 --> 00:25:55,087
But what about your breakfast, ma'am?
Nobody knows how you like your toast but me.

313
00:25:55,196 --> 00:26:00,065
I know how I like my toast.
Good night, Charlie.

314
00:26:31,766 --> 00:26:34,667
Quiet little place, isn't it, sir?

315
00:26:34,769 --> 00:26:37,363
Yes. Very restful.

316
00:26:37,472 --> 00:26:39,372
Oh, yes, sir.

317
00:26:39,474 --> 00:26:42,671
Like, uh, silence in graveyard.

318
00:26:42,777 --> 00:26:46,304
Oh. Y-Yes, sir.
Like a... graveyard.

319
00:26:47,348 --> 00:26:49,316
This way, sir.

320
00:26:51,686 --> 00:26:54,086
Uh, after you, sir.

321
00:26:54,188 --> 00:26:56,156
Thank you so much.

322
00:27:45,606 --> 00:27:48,632
Where'd the— Oh. Hello, sir.

323
00:27:48,743 --> 00:27:50,643
Observe.

324
00:27:50,745 --> 00:27:53,339
Oh, very interesting, sir.

325
00:27:53,448 --> 00:27:56,076
Very, very interesting.

326
00:27:56,184 --> 00:27:58,152
May I inquire what it is, sir?

327
00:27:58,252 --> 00:28:00,516
Corroboration of deductions.

328
00:28:00,621 --> 00:28:03,419
Then we can leave here at once, sir.
Should I pack your bags?

329
00:28:03,524 --> 00:28:05,617
Thank you so much, but, uh...

330
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:08,923
must first request able assistance...

331
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:12,830
in subduing malevolent spirits
in ancient house.

332
00:28:12,934 --> 00:28:15,664
Ye—What do you mean, sir?

333
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:18,898
We investigate downstairs.

334
00:28:19,006 --> 00:28:20,906
N- Now, sir?

335
00:28:21,008 --> 00:28:22,999
Yes.

336
00:28:37,892 --> 00:28:40,326
Do you think that could
be spirits, sir?

337
00:28:40,428 --> 00:28:44,524
Very practical spirit
to enter by door. Come.

338
00:28:47,768 --> 00:28:50,760
That's all. And see
that those gates are locked.

339
00:28:56,811 --> 00:28:59,905
Well, here I am.

340
00:29:01,215 --> 00:29:03,183
Why you come back?

341
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:05,912
You said you were staying here
to investigate.

342
00:29:06,020 --> 00:29:07,988
I want to know what's going on.

343
00:29:08,089 --> 00:29:10,353
Uh, others know you return?

344
00:29:10,458 --> 00:29:13,154
I don't tell them everything I do.

345
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:16,697
- Think advisable
Baxter take you home immediately.
- Hmm!

346
00:29:16,797 --> 00:29:18,924
He's quite right, ma'am.
Now, I think—

347
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:22,696
You don't think.
You think you think.

348
00:29:22,803 --> 00:29:24,703
I think.

349
00:29:24,805 --> 00:29:27,103
Where should we start?
In here?

350
00:29:27,208 --> 00:29:29,108
Very well.

351
00:29:29,210 --> 00:29:33,340
Perhaps woman's intuition,
like feather on arrow—

352
00:29:33,447 --> 00:29:35,608
may help flight to truth.

353
00:29:35,716 --> 00:29:37,547
That's settled.

354
00:29:37,652 --> 00:29:39,813
- Baxter, the door.
- Oh.

355
00:29:48,596 --> 00:29:50,655
Well, Charlie?

356
00:29:50,765 --> 00:29:54,292
- May ask question, please?
- Anything you want to.

357
00:29:54,402 --> 00:29:57,530
Phenomenon of music
always accompany séance?

358
00:29:57,638 --> 00:30:00,106
Nothing unusual about that.

359
00:30:00,208 --> 00:30:04,167
That was merely a manifestation
from the world beyond.

360
00:30:04,278 --> 00:30:07,475
Electric fixtures repaired recently?

361
00:30:07,582 --> 00:30:11,211
No. They haven't
been touched for years.

362
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:14,948
- May step on table, please?
- Certainly, Charlie.

363
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,754
Very strange.

364
00:30:25,633 --> 00:30:28,397
Brass tarnished with age...

365
00:30:28,502 --> 00:30:32,233
but screw head very young.

366
00:30:37,011 --> 00:30:39,912
Boy Scout knife
like lady's hairpin—

367
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:41,982
have many uses.

368
00:30:51,492 --> 00:30:54,461
Radio speaker.

369
00:30:54,562 --> 00:30:58,931
Very simple solution
of music from world beyond.

370
00:31:00,568 --> 00:31:04,060
I can't believe
that Professor Bowan and Carlotta...

371
00:31:04,171 --> 00:31:06,196
would purposely deceive us.

372
00:31:06,307 --> 00:31:09,333
Necessity— mother of invention...

373
00:31:10,878 --> 00:31:13,870
but sometimes
stepmother of deception.

374
00:31:16,751 --> 00:31:20,209
Distinguished professor
stand here tonight.

375
00:31:35,436 --> 00:31:40,669
Switch turn on radio receiving set up there.

376
00:31:42,677 --> 00:31:45,771
If Bowan has done this...

377
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,907
then all of our séances
have been based on trickery.

378
00:31:50,017 --> 00:31:52,110
When pilot unreliable...

379
00:31:52,219 --> 00:31:54,449
ship cannot keep true course.

380
00:31:57,758 --> 00:32:01,216
- Permission, please, to try experiment?
- Certainly.

381
00:32:01,329 --> 00:32:03,320
Turn down lights, please.

382
00:32:03,431 --> 00:32:06,457
But... then we shan't
be able to see, sir.

383
00:32:06,567 --> 00:32:08,535
Do as Mr. Chan says.

384
00:32:14,108 --> 00:32:16,872
- They're off, sir.
- Thank you so much.

385
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:20,105
Please to turn on dim light,
as in séance.

386
00:32:32,526 --> 00:32:38,021
Appearance of Allen Colby
in secret panel most convenient.

387
00:32:39,166 --> 00:32:42,135
Maybe find clue.

388
00:32:42,236 --> 00:32:44,204
Please.

389
00:32:45,373 --> 00:32:48,001
Would be so kind to take position...

390
00:32:48,109 --> 00:32:50,407
occupied by deceased body?

391
00:32:50,511 --> 00:32:53,412
Oh, c-could I be excused,
please, sir?

392
00:32:53,514 --> 00:32:55,948
I- I'm not very good
at that sort of thing.

393
00:32:56,050 --> 00:32:59,451
Role of dead man
require very little acting.

394
00:32:59,553 --> 00:33:01,919
Oh, but really, sir, l—

395
00:33:02,022 --> 00:33:03,922
Go on, Baxter. Go on.

396
00:33:04,024 --> 00:33:07,289
May request, uh...

397
00:33:07,395 --> 00:33:10,796
holding handkerchief before face...

398
00:33:10,898 --> 00:33:12,866
when in position?

399
00:33:26,947 --> 00:33:30,781
Charlie, look!
There, on the handkerchief!

400
00:33:34,722 --> 00:33:39,489
Earlier in evening, use same handkerchief
to wipe face of Allen Colby.

401
00:33:39,593 --> 00:33:42,892
- Oh, now, really, sir, l—
- Be quiet, Baxter.!

402
00:33:44,965 --> 00:33:46,899
What about the handkerchief?

403
00:33:47,001 --> 00:33:49,697
Chemical analysis of same...

404
00:33:49,804 --> 00:33:52,295
prove face of murdered man...

405
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:56,206
treated with solution
of quinine sulfate.

406
00:33:56,310 --> 00:33:59,473
- For what reason?
- Quinine sulfate...

407
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,515
when exposed to rays
of ultraviolet lamp...

408
00:34:02,616 --> 00:34:06,848
produce mysterious light
which accompany apparition.

409
00:34:06,954 --> 00:34:09,514
Well, where could it come from?

410
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:14,522
Answer well hidden,
but hope to find same.

411
00:34:22,570 --> 00:34:25,198
Please! Do not move handkerchief.

412
00:35:02,176 --> 00:35:04,701
Ultraviolet-ray lamp.

413
00:35:07,515 --> 00:35:09,813
Filter on back of mirror...

414
00:35:09,917 --> 00:35:15,514
allow only invisible
ultraviolet rays to enter room.

415
00:35:15,623 --> 00:35:20,993
- Solves mystery of spirit light.
- It solves more than that.

416
00:35:21,095 --> 00:35:24,121
It proves that Bowan knew
that Allen was dead.

417
00:35:25,499 --> 00:35:27,558
He may even have murdered him.

418
00:35:27,668 --> 00:35:32,628
Finding web of spider does not prove
which spider spin web.

419
00:35:32,740 --> 00:35:35,607
I gave Bowan
all the funds he asked for.

420
00:35:35,709 --> 00:35:38,769
I even made provision for him and Carlotta
after my death.

421
00:35:38,879 --> 00:35:42,815
And they knew that if Allen returned,
they would never receive another penny.

422
00:35:42,917 --> 00:35:45,442
In face of present evidence...

423
00:35:45,553 --> 00:35:48,954
may be wise to change
plans for future.

424
00:35:49,056 --> 00:35:51,183
Huh! I'll see to that.

425
00:35:51,292 --> 00:35:53,624
Mr. Phelps has an accounting
of the estate prepared.

426
00:35:53,727 --> 00:35:55,627
I intend to go over it.

427
00:35:55,729 --> 00:35:58,459
And at the same time,
I'll make a new will.

428
00:35:58,566 --> 00:36:00,659
Most excellent precaution.

429
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:25,384
- You are all right?
- Except for the punch in the ribs you gave me.

430
00:36:25,492 --> 00:36:29,019
- Why, you knocked me down.
- Most happy.

431
00:36:29,129 --> 00:36:32,121
Punch in ribs more desirable
than shot in back.

432
00:36:32,232 --> 00:36:34,291
There's no argument about that.

433
00:36:34,401 --> 00:36:37,461
Where's Baxter? Baxter.

434
00:36:40,641 --> 00:36:43,735
- Here I am, ma'am.
- Well, you would be.

435
00:36:43,844 --> 00:36:45,812
Well, what do we do next?

436
00:36:45,913 --> 00:36:48,074
Suggest leaving here immediately.

437
00:36:48,182 --> 00:36:50,377
That's a very good idea, sir.

438
00:36:54,588 --> 00:36:57,079
We're—We're locked in, sir.

439
00:36:57,191 --> 00:36:59,091
Locked in? Nonsense.

440
00:37:01,328 --> 00:37:03,455
Can you hear that, sir?

441
00:37:15,509 --> 00:37:19,809
- Oh! Fred, it's you.
- What's happened?

442
00:37:19,913 --> 00:37:22,347
Somebody tried to kill Charlie.

443
00:37:22,449 --> 00:37:24,747
What?

444
00:37:24,852 --> 00:37:27,844
I think you acted very foolishly
in coming here at this hour of the night.

445
00:37:27,955 --> 00:37:31,652
Fear for Mrs. Lowell's safety
reason for visit?

446
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:35,320
Exactly. Janice and I went to her bedroom
to say good night.

447
00:37:35,429 --> 00:37:38,626
When I found she wasn't there,
I had a hunch she was over here with you.

448
00:37:38,732 --> 00:37:40,700
I saw her car outside and came in.

449
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:44,794
Thank you.
Suggest you go home now—

450
00:37:44,905 --> 00:37:47,567
Uh, with Baxter.

451
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:51,910
Have something very important.

452
00:37:52,012 --> 00:37:54,640
Would like your able assistance.

453
00:37:54,748 --> 00:37:56,875
Of course,
if there's anything I can do.

454
00:37:56,984 --> 00:38:00,750
- Now, look here, Charlie. I want to know—
- Tomorrow, please.

455
00:38:00,854 --> 00:38:04,221
- You go home now.
- Oh, very well.

456
00:38:04,324 --> 00:38:06,758
- Come on, Baxter.
- Thank you.

457
00:38:11,598 --> 00:38:16,399
- Observe anyone leaving house
when entering grounds?
- Not a soul.

458
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:20,098
- Ulrich admit you?
- No. The gates were unlocked.

459
00:38:22,543 --> 00:38:24,443
Strange.

460
00:38:24,545 --> 00:38:28,504
Someone very familiar
with ancient house...

461
00:38:28,615 --> 00:38:31,311
fire gun from there.

462
00:38:31,418 --> 00:38:33,978
I know this place inside and out.

463
00:38:34,088 --> 00:38:36,056
It's a regular honeycomb
of passages...

464
00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:38,681
that start everywhere
and end nowhere.

465
00:38:38,792 --> 00:38:40,817
- You want me to show you?
- No.

466
00:38:42,029 --> 00:38:44,759
Will investigate honeycomb later.

467
00:38:44,865 --> 00:38:47,333
Maybe find bee.

468
00:38:47,434 --> 00:38:49,402
Shall we go?

469
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,480
At present, much concerned
about Mrs. Lowell.

470
00:39:07,588 --> 00:39:09,556
What do you mean?

471
00:39:09,656 --> 00:39:12,921
Not so certain
gunfire directed at humble self.

472
00:39:13,026 --> 00:39:15,460
You think the attempt
was made on her life?

473
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:19,430
Maybe. Suggest
you go to police at once.

474
00:39:19,533 --> 00:39:22,434
Request guard for Mrs. Lowell
day and night.

475
00:39:22,536 --> 00:39:24,504
I'll go immediately.

476
00:39:44,291 --> 00:39:47,488
Caretaker keep very late hours.

477
00:39:48,729 --> 00:39:50,697
Ulrich's a queer old bird.

478
00:39:50,798 --> 00:39:53,266
Have noticed Ulrich
not friendly to family.

479
00:39:53,367 --> 00:39:55,562
May ask reason why?

480
00:39:55,669 --> 00:39:58,797
Oh, Allen was engaged
to Ulrich's daughter.

481
00:39:58,906 --> 00:40:02,364
After he left home, he broke with her,
and she committed suicide.

482
00:40:02,476 --> 00:40:04,944
Ulrich held Allen responsible.

483
00:40:05,045 --> 00:40:08,412
Strange house have more
than one skeleton in closet.

484
00:40:53,327 --> 00:40:55,295
- Good morning.
- Good day.

485
00:40:55,395 --> 00:40:59,126
May ask question, please?

486
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:03,067
You were here yesterday
at cottage about 5:00?

487
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:05,070
Yes.

488
00:41:05,172 --> 00:41:09,438
Then if Allen Colby ring bell,
would have heard same?

489
00:41:09,543 --> 00:41:12,273
Well, uh, I didn't hear him.

490
00:41:12,379 --> 00:41:15,815
Strange someone
should climb over wall...

491
00:41:15,916 --> 00:41:17,975
without first trying bell.

492
00:41:18,085 --> 00:41:21,418
If someone were sneaking in here
to commit murder...

493
00:41:21,521 --> 00:41:24,490
do you think they'd ring the bell
to let me know about it?

494
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:26,491
Correction, please.

495
00:41:26,593 --> 00:41:30,120
Murderer would not
climb over wall near gate.

496
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:33,631
Would look for more secret place.

497
00:41:33,734 --> 00:41:35,634
Thank you so much.

498
00:44:32,913 --> 00:44:34,938
What do you want?

499
00:44:35,048 --> 00:44:37,141
Pardon intrusion, please.

500
00:44:38,718 --> 00:44:42,313
Observe radio aerial on roof.

501
00:44:42,422 --> 00:44:44,390
Well?

502
00:44:47,694 --> 00:44:52,131
Perhaps earphones reason
for not hearing bell yesterday...

503
00:44:52,232 --> 00:44:54,200
when Allen Colby arrive.

504
00:44:54,301 --> 00:44:57,134
I tell you I didn't hear the bell.

505
00:44:57,237 --> 00:44:59,831
I don't know where I was
or what I was doing.

506
00:45:05,712 --> 00:45:08,408
Radio transmitter...

507
00:45:08,515 --> 00:45:13,111
used last night to broadcast music
for séance?

508
00:45:13,220 --> 00:45:15,916
You're barking up the wrong tree.

509
00:45:16,022 --> 00:45:18,354
I don't know nothing about radio.

510
00:45:18,458 --> 00:45:22,519
This stuff belongs to my son.
I'm shipping it to him.

511
00:45:24,397 --> 00:45:26,661
You can't catch me on that.

512
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:30,463
Only thing Charlie Chan catch
is cold in head.

513
00:45:36,309 --> 00:45:39,870
Uh, can spare quinine, please?

514
00:45:43,116 --> 00:45:45,880
I haven't got any.

515
00:45:45,986 --> 00:45:49,217
Perhaps give to Professor Bowan
who suffer from cold...

516
00:45:49,322 --> 00:45:51,290
when visiting here yesterday.

517
00:45:51,391 --> 00:45:54,155
Why don't you go and ask him?

518
00:45:54,261 --> 00:45:57,594
Very good idea.
Thank you so much.

519
00:46:15,448 --> 00:46:17,279
So sorry professor not at home.

520
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:22,321
Hope to get valuable information
about séance last night.

521
00:46:22,422 --> 00:46:24,856
- Can I help you?
- Thank you.

522
00:46:24,958 --> 00:46:27,859
Small point of information.

523
00:46:27,961 --> 00:46:31,260
When in contact with spirit world...

524
00:46:31,364 --> 00:46:34,390
find ultraviolet light useful?

525
00:46:35,502 --> 00:46:37,470
I don't understand you.

526
00:46:37,571 --> 00:46:40,301
Very peculiar circumstance.

527
00:46:40,407 --> 00:46:45,071
Allen Colby's face treated
with solution of quinine.

528
00:46:45,178 --> 00:46:48,909
When exposed to ultraviolet light...

529
00:46:49,015 --> 00:46:52,610
produce glow not from spirit world.

530
00:46:52,719 --> 00:46:54,619
If what you say is true, Mr. Chan...

531
00:46:54,721 --> 00:46:56,621
it has nothing to do with us.

532
00:46:56,723 --> 00:46:59,419
There has never been any fraud
connected with my work.

533
00:46:59,526 --> 00:47:01,960
The power which was given me
to communicate with the other world...

534
00:47:02,062 --> 00:47:03,962
has never been misused.

535
00:47:04,064 --> 00:47:08,592
Have utmost respect
for true believer in psychic things.

536
00:47:08,702 --> 00:47:11,671
But can explain, please...

537
00:47:11,771 --> 00:47:15,730
source of music
which accompany séance last night?

538
00:47:15,842 --> 00:47:17,867
Yes. I'll show you.

539
00:47:26,620 --> 00:47:28,850
It was sent
from this transmitting set.

540
00:47:28,955 --> 00:47:32,288
We always use music
as a background for our work.

541
00:47:32,392 --> 00:47:35,657
Hmm. Most interesting.

542
00:47:40,133 --> 00:47:42,693
Repeating device...

543
00:47:42,802 --> 00:47:45,202
with control switch at Colby House...

544
00:47:45,305 --> 00:47:48,001
so music can be picked up
at any time?

545
00:47:51,244 --> 00:47:52,973
Shortwave coil.

546
00:48:03,323 --> 00:48:06,292
That ought to keep him quiet long enough
for us to make a getaway.

547
00:48:06,393 --> 00:48:08,554
Then it's true.
You knew about Allen Colby.

548
00:48:08,662 --> 00:48:12,564
There's no time to talk now. If Chan was
that close on us, the police won't be far behind.

549
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:14,861
- Come on!
- I'm not going. I was no part of it.

550
00:48:14,968 --> 00:48:18,426
But you can't prove that to the police.

551
00:48:24,811 --> 00:48:26,938
- Where's Bowan?
- You'd better go in there at once.

552
00:48:27,981 --> 00:48:30,848
- Charlie.
- What happened?

553
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,918
Get a chair.

554
00:48:34,921 --> 00:48:37,481
Are you all right?

555
00:48:37,590 --> 00:48:42,789
Uh, when firecrackers stop exploding in head,
will be quite all right.

556
00:48:42,896 --> 00:48:45,888
You need the aspirin
this time, Charlie.

557
00:48:47,534 --> 00:48:49,434
Now, where's Bowan?

558
00:48:49,536 --> 00:48:51,504
He left just before you came in.

559
00:48:51,604 --> 00:48:55,040
That's why you sent us in here.
You were covering up for him to make a getaway.

560
00:48:55,141 --> 00:48:58,577
- You're under arrest. Take her out, Harris.
- Let's go, sister.

561
00:48:58,678 --> 00:49:00,771
Get on the phone
and send out a general broadcast.

562
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,508
Yes, sir.

563
00:49:03,616 --> 00:49:06,380
I want to be the first
to congratulate you, Charlie.

564
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:09,853
You let the murderer of Allen Colby
slip right through your fingers.

565
00:49:09,956 --> 00:49:14,188
So sorry. Like child
who play with matches, get burned.

566
00:49:14,294 --> 00:49:18,321
- Live and learn.
- Yeah, live and learn.

567
00:49:18,431 --> 00:49:22,094
When we pick up Bowan,
I'll send you an invitation to the blow-off.

568
00:49:24,371 --> 00:49:26,339
Thank you so much.

569
00:49:26,439 --> 00:49:29,875
I guess Morton's right. It must have been
Bowan who killed Colby...

570
00:49:29,976 --> 00:49:32,035
and tried to get Mrs. Lowell
last night.

571
00:49:32,145 --> 00:49:35,376
Wheel of fate has many spokes.

572
00:49:35,482 --> 00:49:38,246
Which means you have
something on your mind. What is it?

573
00:49:38,351 --> 00:49:42,720
Mind at present like hangover
after misspent evening.

574
00:49:44,023 --> 00:49:47,117
Must keep important engagement
with Mrs. Lowell.

575
00:49:47,227 --> 00:49:49,127
Hat, please.

576
00:50:11,217 --> 00:50:13,242
"And the sum of $100,000...

577
00:50:13,353 --> 00:50:16,516
"to endow the Colby Foundation
for Psychic Research...

578
00:50:16,623 --> 00:50:19,456
"such foundation to be administered
by Warren T. Phelps...

579
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,427
on behalf of my dearly beloved friends
Alfred and Carlotta Bowan."

580
00:50:24,697 --> 00:50:27,131
That is the clause you want
to strike from the will?

581
00:50:27,233 --> 00:50:30,259
- It certainly is.
- Then I'll draw up a new document.

582
00:50:30,370 --> 00:50:32,270
I'll have it ready
for your signature tonight.

583
00:50:32,372 --> 00:50:36,570
Have you any idea how much
these people have cost me so far?

584
00:50:36,676 --> 00:50:39,201
I'll have to check over your accounts
to get the exact amount.

585
00:50:39,312 --> 00:50:41,940
We're going over
all the accounts tonight...

586
00:50:42,048 --> 00:50:43,027
when Mr. Phelps brings the new will.

587
00:50:43,062 --> 00:50:44,007
When Mr. Phelps brings the new will.

588
00:50:45,919 --> 00:50:48,149
- Ulrich wants to see you, madam.
- What is it, Ulrich?

589
00:50:48,254 --> 00:50:50,586
- I've come to quit.
- That will be a relief.

590
00:50:50,690 --> 00:50:53,124
And it'll be a relief to me too!

591
00:50:53,226 --> 00:50:55,660
I don't have to stay here
to be spied on by policemen.

592
00:50:55,762 --> 00:50:58,356
I don't know anything
about Allen Colby!

593
00:50:58,465 --> 00:51:00,433
It's his fault that my girl
is in her grave...

594
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:02,433
and he got what was coming to him.

595
00:51:02,535 --> 00:51:04,833
That's enough!

596
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:06,906
Wait in the hall,
and I'll pay you off.

597
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:17,045
In my opinion, it would be better
to watch Ulrich than look for Bowan.

598
00:51:17,150 --> 00:51:19,141
He's hated Allen enough to kill him.

599
00:51:19,252 --> 00:51:21,243
No one being overlooked.

600
00:51:21,354 --> 00:51:24,755
When weaving nets,
all threads counted.

601
00:51:24,858 --> 00:51:28,157
- I'll be back with the new will after dinner.
- Make it 8:30.

602
00:51:28,261 --> 00:51:30,252
I'll have those figures
ready for you by then.

603
00:51:30,363 --> 00:51:34,732
And don't worry. Mr. Morton will have
a police guard here until Bowan is captured.

604
00:51:34,834 --> 00:51:37,302
Good-bye.

605
00:51:37,403 --> 00:51:39,530
- Good-bye, Mother.
- Good-bye, dear.

606
00:51:49,949 --> 00:51:52,440
Well, Charlie, what are your plans?

607
00:51:53,786 --> 00:51:58,382
- Uh, what hour is dinner, please?
- 7:30.

608
00:51:58,491 --> 00:52:01,824
And after dinner,
what is usual occupation?

609
00:52:01,928 --> 00:52:05,489
Generally, I spend an hour
here at the Ouija board.

610
00:52:18,378 --> 00:52:21,370
I must repeat, madam, that—
that this sort of thing...

611
00:52:21,481 --> 00:52:24,041
leaves me a— a little creepy.

612
00:52:35,695 --> 00:52:38,789
- 8:25.
- Not much chance of anything happening.

613
00:52:38,898 --> 00:52:41,992
Even one of Bowan's spooks
couldn't get through this police net.

614
00:52:42,101 --> 00:52:44,661
Unknown danger
like summer lightning—

615
00:52:44,771 --> 00:52:46,739
strike where least expected.

616
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:48,807
I'll have another look around.

617
00:52:51,177 --> 00:52:53,077
Just a minute.

618
00:52:53,179 --> 00:52:55,443
- All right, Myers. Mr. Gage is one of the family.
- Thanks.

619
00:52:55,548 --> 00:52:58,210
- Picked up Bowan yet?
- No, but we'll get him.

620
00:52:58,318 --> 00:53:00,309
He hasn't a chance
of getting out of town.

621
00:53:07,226 --> 00:53:09,285
Excuse me, madam.

622
00:53:16,269 --> 00:53:19,136
- Good evening, sir.
- Has Mr. Phelps arrived yet?

623
00:53:19,238 --> 00:53:22,139
Not yet, sir.

624
00:53:30,149 --> 00:53:32,140
Search the neighborhood.

625
00:53:51,971 --> 00:53:53,939
What's the matter here?

626
00:53:54,040 --> 00:53:56,270
Mrs. Lowell was shot through the head
from outside the house.

627
00:53:56,376 --> 00:54:00,278
- What?
- Must request no one enter
except police at present.

628
00:54:00,380 --> 00:54:04,248
- Yes, but you can't stop me.
- Better stay here. You wouldn't like to see it.

629
00:54:09,856 --> 00:54:13,553
- Find anything?
- Not yet. But this gentleman just drove up.

630
00:54:13,660 --> 00:54:15,958
Dick has told me.
It— It seems unbelievable.

631
00:54:16,062 --> 00:54:18,030
Whoever it was outguessed us.

632
00:54:18,131 --> 00:54:21,396
I don't see how it was done
with the place surrounded by police.

633
00:54:21,501 --> 00:54:24,231
Also strange murder should occur...

634
00:54:24,337 --> 00:54:26,396
At exact hour of appointment.

635
00:54:27,740 --> 00:54:30,038
Hello. Morton speaking
from the Lowell house.

636
00:54:30,143 --> 00:54:32,737
Send out the homicide squad
and the coroner.

637
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:37,381
You'll want to hold the body
till after the inquest of course.

638
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,451
What's happened?

639
00:54:41,621 --> 00:54:43,748
Was it Mother?

640
00:54:45,258 --> 00:54:48,284
- Let me go to her!
- Can do nothing now.

641
00:54:48,394 --> 00:54:51,557
Why did you let it happen?
You knew she was in danger.

642
00:54:51,664 --> 00:54:53,632
It's all your fault!

643
00:54:53,733 --> 00:54:55,633
Alice, please.

644
00:54:55,735 --> 00:54:58,135
Better take the young lady
away from the house for the night.

645
00:54:58,237 --> 00:55:00,535
We'll have a lot to do here.
Come along, Harris.

646
00:55:02,341 --> 00:55:07,142
Mr. Chan, I can't help but feel
that Alice is right in holding you responsible.

647
00:55:07,246 --> 00:55:10,079
You proved that Bowan was guilty
of the murder of Allen Colby.

648
00:55:10,183 --> 00:55:13,016
You knew he made an attempt
on Mrs. Lowell's life last night...

649
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:15,349
yet you failed to turn him over
to the police.

650
00:55:15,455 --> 00:55:19,255
Most humbly regret
very fatal error...

651
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:22,088
which cost life of dear old friend.

652
00:55:32,939 --> 00:55:34,998
Mr. Chan.

653
00:55:35,108 --> 00:55:37,599
I'm sorry I lost my head.

654
00:55:37,710 --> 00:55:40,235
I know you did the best you could.

655
00:55:40,346 --> 00:55:44,282
Extend deepest sympathy.

656
00:55:44,383 --> 00:55:48,183
But though loved one
seem to be taken away...

657
00:55:48,287 --> 00:55:50,585
remain always near.

658
00:56:17,150 --> 00:56:21,280
- Mr. Baxter.
- Yes, sir?

659
00:56:38,504 --> 00:56:41,200
So sorry, but need your help.

660
00:56:41,307 --> 00:56:43,901
What do you make of this?

661
00:56:44,010 --> 00:56:45,978
Someone's been smoking, sir.

662
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:49,047
Oh. The villain must have stood right here
when he fired that fatal shot.

663
00:56:49,148 --> 00:56:53,175
No. Hasty deduction
like ancient egg—

664
00:56:53,286 --> 00:56:56,483
look good from outside.

665
00:56:56,589 --> 00:57:01,788
Shot come from high-powered rifle
fired from distant place.

666
00:57:01,894 --> 00:57:03,862
Really, sir?

667
00:57:05,731 --> 00:57:09,690
May ask, please, to climb tree?

668
00:57:09,802 --> 00:57:12,362
Oh, must I, sir?

669
00:57:12,471 --> 00:57:15,565
Ample proportions
limit athletic ability.

670
00:57:15,675 --> 00:57:18,269
Ye—Yes, sir.

671
00:57:21,013 --> 00:57:22,981
Will you give me a leg up, sir?

672
00:57:26,052 --> 00:57:29,954
When I was young, l—
I used to be quite agile, sir.

673
00:57:34,060 --> 00:57:37,928
Well, there—There's not very much
to be seen from up here, sir.

674
00:57:38,030 --> 00:57:41,295
Observe small branch
near right hand?

675
00:57:43,402 --> 00:57:45,267
Oh. Oh, yes, sir.

676
00:57:45,371 --> 00:57:47,532
Break is clean cut?

677
00:57:47,640 --> 00:57:49,631
Might have been done
with a saw, sir.

678
00:57:49,742 --> 00:57:51,710
Thank you so much.

679
00:57:51,811 --> 00:57:54,143
Please hold finger on branch.

680
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:04,156
Oh!

681
00:58:26,279 --> 00:58:28,247
Ahh!

682
00:58:39,525 --> 00:58:42,517
Please remove body
from line of vision.

683
00:58:42,628 --> 00:58:46,587
Well, uh—Well, it— Oh!

684
00:58:46,699 --> 00:58:48,667
Oh.

685
00:59:11,824 --> 00:59:15,157
Oh, Mr. Chan! Mr. —

686
00:59:15,261 --> 00:59:17,695
Hey! Ohh! Ow!

687
00:59:21,233 --> 00:59:25,363
- Good morning.
- You're on the job early, Mr. Chan. Find anything?

688
00:59:25,471 --> 00:59:29,168
- Hope to establish important fact.
- Let me in on it.

689
00:59:29,275 --> 00:59:33,234
- Must first exact promise of silence.
- I promise.

690
00:59:33,346 --> 00:59:36,679
As son Lee would say,
"Okeydoke." Let us go.

691
00:59:48,894 --> 00:59:52,557
Well, what led you
to this, Mr. Chan?

692
00:59:52,665 --> 00:59:56,999
At last, find use
for simple geometry.

693
00:59:57,103 --> 01:00:00,698
High-power bullet
take shortest distance...

694
01:00:00,806 --> 01:00:03,741
between three points.

695
01:00:18,924 --> 01:00:21,392
Criminal very clever.

696
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:27,126
Arrange device so when
electric hammer strike bell...

697
01:00:27,233 --> 01:00:30,100
also operate trigger on rifle.

698
01:00:32,738 --> 01:00:35,935
And after the first shot was fired,
it kept pulling the trigger.

699
01:00:36,042 --> 01:00:38,977
- Yes.
- Be careful. You've reloaded the chamber.

700
01:00:39,078 --> 01:00:41,546
How you know magazine was full?

701
01:00:41,647 --> 01:00:43,638
Well, l— I thought it might be.

702
01:00:43,749 --> 01:00:45,774
- Quite right.
- But that's dangerous.

703
01:00:45,885 --> 01:00:48,581
- When the clock strikes again—
- Do not disturb.

704
01:00:50,923 --> 01:00:52,891
Twenty minutes after 9:00.

705
01:00:52,992 --> 01:00:56,450
Suggest we return to Lowell house
immediately.

706
01:01:04,437 --> 01:01:08,203
She was sitting right there when
the shot came through the window.

707
01:01:08,307 --> 01:01:10,605
- Pardon interruption, please.
- Oh, come right in.

708
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:14,008
- Got into any new trouble?
- So sorry to disappoint.

709
01:01:14,113 --> 01:01:16,775
May offer slight demonstration,
please?

710
01:01:16,882 --> 01:01:18,850
Help yourself.

711
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:26,854
What's it going to be—
interior decorating?

712
01:01:26,959 --> 01:01:29,951
Why don't you try a couple of sunflowers in it?

713
01:01:30,062 --> 01:01:34,863
Atrocious libel on Chinese art
quite sufficient.

714
01:01:34,967 --> 01:01:37,834
Have only little time to wait.
Please to stand back.

715
01:01:44,977 --> 01:01:47,207
Stand back!

716
01:01:52,785 --> 01:01:54,912
- Are you all right, Baxter?
- I don't know, sir.

717
01:01:57,756 --> 01:02:00,953
You win, Charlie. What's the answer?

718
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:05,656
If tongue in tower bell could speak,
would have solution.

719
01:02:05,764 --> 01:02:09,495
- What does that mean in English?
- Suggest we take short walk.

720
01:02:24,016 --> 01:02:27,816
Hello? Hello?

721
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,888
It-It's your office, sir.

722
01:02:32,992 --> 01:02:35,483
Hello. Morton talking.

723
01:02:38,430 --> 01:02:40,990
Be there right away.

724
01:02:41,100 --> 01:02:43,068
Well, they've caught Bowan.

725
01:02:43,169 --> 01:02:48,072
Instead of your short walk,
how about a short ride to my office?

726
01:02:48,174 --> 01:02:53,578
Voice of professor may tell us more
than tongue of silent bell.

727
01:02:59,285 --> 01:03:02,721
I didn't do it, I tell you. Whoever killed
Allen Colby tried to hang it on me.

728
01:03:02,821 --> 01:03:04,789
And I suppose you didn't
plant that trick light...

729
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:06,858
and wash Allen Colby's face
with quinine...

730
01:03:06,959 --> 01:03:10,224
so you could pull a phony ghost
at your séance.

731
01:03:12,164 --> 01:03:15,895
- Have you anything to say?
- Leave her alone. She had nothing to do with it.

732
01:03:16,001 --> 01:03:19,937
Well, how about it?

733
01:03:20,039 --> 01:03:22,906
You can save yourself a lot of grief
by turning state's evidence.

734
01:03:23,008 --> 01:03:26,603
I have nothing to confess.
I have always acted in good faith.

735
01:03:31,784 --> 01:03:33,877
That's all for now.

736
01:03:33,986 --> 01:03:36,454
Take 'em out.

737
01:03:42,861 --> 01:03:45,125
Four hours wasted...

738
01:03:45,231 --> 01:03:48,598
but I'll get it out of'em
if it's the last thing I do.

739
01:03:48,701 --> 01:03:51,864
- Have idea.
- Another one?

740
01:03:51,971 --> 01:03:54,531
With proper lever...

741
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,700
baby's fingers can move mountain.

742
01:03:57,810 --> 01:03:59,778
What do you mean?

743
01:03:59,878 --> 01:04:03,644
Believe have plan...

744
01:04:03,749 --> 01:04:06,547
to secure much-desired confession.

745
01:04:16,795 --> 01:04:19,593
I don't see why we should have been
called here for this morbid nonsense.

746
01:04:19,698 --> 01:04:21,598
There's no use complaining about it.

747
01:04:21,700 --> 01:04:25,261
Why, you got no right to bring me into this.

748
01:04:25,371 --> 01:04:27,339
Yes? Well, you're here, brother.

749
01:04:27,439 --> 01:04:29,839
All right, Harris.
Come on inside.

750
01:04:29,942 --> 01:04:32,308
- All set, Charlie.
- Thank you.

751
01:04:43,856 --> 01:04:45,756
Please.

752
01:04:46,792 --> 01:04:49,590
Request everyone
take same positions...

753
01:04:49,695 --> 01:04:52,186
as on night of eventful séance.

754
01:04:55,734 --> 01:04:58,669
Oh, Harris. Stand by the door.
Have men in the hall.

755
01:04:58,771 --> 01:05:01,467
- Be sure the outside of the house is covered.
- Yes, sir.

756
01:05:04,677 --> 01:05:06,804
Pardon, please, inconvenience...

757
01:05:06,912 --> 01:05:08,880
of bringing everyone here tonight.

758
01:05:08,981 --> 01:05:11,882
Motive for recent murders...

759
01:05:11,984 --> 01:05:15,249
like tangle of many strings...

760
01:05:15,354 --> 01:05:19,313
ends of which held
by persons in this room.

761
01:05:20,592 --> 01:05:23,527
First string held
by psychic mediums.

762
01:05:23,629 --> 01:05:27,065
Professor Bowan and Carlotta...

763
01:05:27,166 --> 01:05:29,968
had $ 100,000 endowment
to lose by change in will.

764
01:05:30,003 --> 01:05:32,770
Had $ 100,000 endowment
to lose by change in will.

765
01:05:32,871 --> 01:05:38,537
Same change deprive Mr. Phelps,
administrator of estate...

766
01:05:38,644 --> 01:05:41,112
from handling large fortune.

767
01:05:43,082 --> 01:05:45,107
Have ascertained...

768
01:05:45,217 --> 01:05:48,675
he had recently
big losses in stock market.

769
01:05:50,989 --> 01:05:56,325
Caretaker Ulrich
have old-time grudge...

770
01:05:56,428 --> 01:05:59,727
against Allen Colby
for tragedy to daughter.

771
01:05:59,832 --> 01:06:03,962
Other strings held
by Lowell family...

772
01:06:04,069 --> 01:06:09,701
who have everything to lose
if Allen Colby return to claim estate.

773
01:06:09,808 --> 01:06:15,303
Tonight, will try
very sincere experiment...

774
01:06:15,414 --> 01:06:18,212
in effort to untangle motives.

775
01:06:18,317 --> 01:06:22,378
Will call upon spirit world...

776
01:06:22,488 --> 01:06:25,946
for message from great beyond.

777
01:06:27,593 --> 01:06:29,493
Proceed, please.

778
01:06:29,595 --> 01:06:32,393
Mr. Gage,
will you turn down the lights?

779
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:45,237
We will pause a moment
in meditation.

780
01:06:57,389 --> 01:06:59,357
I feel...

781
01:07:01,460 --> 01:07:06,022
a presence... near.

782
01:07:08,467 --> 01:07:10,526
It is a woman.

783
01:07:17,943 --> 01:07:20,173
She is trying to come to us.

784
01:07:20,279 --> 01:07:25,478
Her image is becoming clearer.

785
01:07:27,419 --> 01:07:29,979
Clearer.

786
01:07:30,088 --> 01:07:32,215
She is trying to speak.

787
01:07:34,126 --> 01:07:36,526
She has a message...

788
01:07:36,628 --> 01:07:39,062
- a message for—
- Mother!

789
01:07:39,164 --> 01:07:42,622
I have come back...

790
01:07:42,734 --> 01:07:45,134
to tell you the truth.

791
01:07:47,573 --> 01:07:50,508
I know now...

792
01:07:50,609 --> 01:07:53,305
the one who fears discovery...

793
01:07:54,513 --> 01:07:57,380
the one who murdered—

794
01:07:58,484 --> 01:08:01,920
- Turn on the lights!
- See that no one leaves this room.

795
01:08:13,398 --> 01:08:16,231
Someone make very foolish mistake.

796
01:08:16,335 --> 01:08:19,270
Throw knife
at spirit reflection in mirror.

797
01:08:22,341 --> 01:08:24,309
May come out now.

798
01:08:26,712 --> 01:08:30,341
- Mrs. Lowell!
- Mother!
- Mother, darling!

799
01:08:30,449 --> 01:08:33,179
- Oh, I'm so happy.
- Yes, dear.

800
01:08:33,285 --> 01:08:36,152
You have to die to really find out
how much people miss you.

801
01:08:36,255 --> 01:08:40,021
- But why did you do this?
- I'll let Charlie explain that, dear.

802
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:44,892
Sincerely hope explanation
will justify cause of anguish.

803
01:08:48,467 --> 01:08:50,833
Person who throw this knife...

804
01:08:50,936 --> 01:08:54,770
also kill Allen Colby
when he return to claim estate...

805
01:08:54,873 --> 01:08:57,137
place body behind secret panel.

806
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:08,152
Then use ultraviolet-ray device...

807
01:09:08,253 --> 01:09:11,654
to make body appear
as apparition at séance.

808
01:09:13,525 --> 01:09:17,291
Same murderer also try
to kill Mrs. Lowell...

809
01:09:17,396 --> 01:09:19,421
on night of business conference...

810
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:22,830
but make mistake
of shooting dummy...

811
01:09:22,935 --> 01:09:26,234
which humble self and Mr. Morton
place at study window.

812
01:09:26,338 --> 01:09:29,273
Same murderer now in this room.

813
01:09:30,475 --> 01:09:34,468
Use twin of knife
that kill Allen Colby.

814
01:09:34,580 --> 01:09:37,845
Observe.
Both knives now missing.

815
01:09:37,950 --> 01:09:40,976
As I stood up right here,
someone passed me in the dark.

816
01:09:41,086 --> 01:09:43,987
I heard someone too.
It was you, Ulrich.

817
01:09:44,089 --> 01:09:46,557
It wasn't!
I- I was over there near Mr. Morton.

818
01:09:46,658 --> 01:09:48,683
- You went for that knife.
- I didn't, I tell you!

819
01:09:48,794 --> 01:09:51,388
- Liar! I saw you!
- I didn't!
- Moment, please!

820
01:09:55,534 --> 01:10:00,369
- You are guilty man.
- I? You're crazy.

821
01:10:00,472 --> 01:10:02,030
Contradiction, please.

822
01:10:02,140 --> 01:10:04,768
Took precaution
before séance tonight...

823
01:10:04,876 --> 01:10:07,208
to cover blade of knife
with graphite.

824
01:10:08,413 --> 01:10:10,779
Telltale fingers sign confession.

825
01:10:10,882 --> 01:10:13,715
Stand back! Everybody!

826
01:10:15,654 --> 01:10:17,178
Stay where you are.!

827
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:30,700
You commit murder in attempt...

828
01:10:30,802 --> 01:10:34,101
to cover evidence of forgery
in Lowell accounts.

829
01:10:34,206 --> 01:10:37,004
- Own act tonight convict you.
- All right, Harris.

830
01:10:41,013 --> 01:10:42,913
Come on.

831
01:10:48,253 --> 01:10:50,380
There, there, dear.

832
01:10:50,489 --> 01:10:52,980
I know you had nothing
to do with it.

833
01:10:54,092 --> 01:10:57,061
Very grateful for valuable assistance.

834
01:10:57,162 --> 01:11:01,622
Believe that, tonight,
you practice deception for first time.

835
01:11:01,733 --> 01:11:04,293
I wish I could say
the same for you, Bowan.

836
01:11:04,403 --> 01:11:07,804
After all, I'm the one
who was imposed upon...

837
01:11:07,906 --> 01:11:10,431
and I withdraw
all charges against them.

838
01:11:10,542 --> 01:11:12,442
We'll mark it closed, Mrs. Lowell.

839
01:11:12,544 --> 01:11:15,809
- Thank you.
- There's a train east at 11:45.

840
01:11:16,882 --> 01:11:18,850
- Good-bye.
- Good-bye.

841
01:11:24,523 --> 01:11:26,923
You take now.

842
01:11:27,025 --> 01:11:30,222
Oh, Charlie, I think
you've earned a rest.

843
01:11:30,328 --> 01:11:33,297
Now we can settle down
to a comfortable visit.

844
01:11:33,398 --> 01:11:36,959
So sorry, but, uh...

845
01:11:37,069 --> 01:11:40,903
must return to happy family
in Honolulu.

846
01:11:41,006 --> 01:11:43,201
You've done a great job, Charlie.

847
01:11:43,308 --> 01:11:46,471
Heh. I wish I could make you
a present of the city hall.

848
01:11:46,578 --> 01:11:51,242
If family continue to increase,
may consider generous offer.

849
01:11:53,351 --> 01:11:55,251
Thank you so much.
