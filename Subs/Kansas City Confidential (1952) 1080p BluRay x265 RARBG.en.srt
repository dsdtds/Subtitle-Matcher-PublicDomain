1
00:04:52,084 --> 00:04:54,814
<i>- Hello, Pete.
- You've got a wrong number.</i>

2
00:05:12,238 --> 00:05:14,434
<i>Don't hang up on me again, Pete.</i>

3
00:05:15,275 --> 00:05:17,870
<i>If I was a cop or one of the boys,
I wouldn't bother calling,</i>

4
00:05:17,945 --> 00:05:20,412
<i>-I'd just walk in on you.
- I'm trying to tell you, you got a...</i>

5
00:05:20,513 --> 00:05:22,777
I'm doing the telling, Pete.

6
00:05:23,149 --> 00:05:26,050
I didn't crack to the clerk
your name's not Johnson.

7
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,919
Listen, whoever you are...

8
00:05:27,988 --> 00:05:30,149
<i>I'm your one chance
to get out from under.</i>

9
00:05:30,257 --> 00:05:33,556
<i>Three hundred grand and clean getaway.
Out of the country.</i>

10
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:37,555
Who is this?

11
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:40,797
If you're interested, come to Room 302,

12
00:05:40,868 --> 00:05:42,859
Baker Hotel, 10:00 tonight.

13
00:05:44,405 --> 00:05:45,963
Hey, wait a minute!

14
00:06:37,327 --> 00:06:40,228
Come in.

15
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,651
No change, Pete? Still jumpy.

16
00:07:03,454 --> 00:07:06,481
That was a sucker move,
burning down your boss.

17
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:10,554
You had him all wrong.
He never crossed you.

18
00:07:10,996 --> 00:07:13,965
But you're a guy who shoots first
and thinks afterward.

19
00:07:15,567 --> 00:07:18,001
In your spot I'd almost choose the cops,

20
00:07:19,339 --> 00:07:21,933
even if it is a first degree murder rap.

21
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,865
It's lucky I spotted you.

22
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:26,779
What's so lucky about being dead?

23
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,572
I'm going to take care of a guy,
just a little too smart.

24
00:07:29,884 --> 00:07:31,111
Take off the mask.

25
00:07:32,018 --> 00:07:34,680
Come on, take it off. I don't like games.

26
00:07:44,198 --> 00:07:45,563
What makes a two-bit heel like you

27
00:07:45,633 --> 00:07:47,864
think a heater would give him an edge
over me?

28
00:07:47,936 --> 00:07:50,164
I ought to ram it down your throat.

29
00:07:51,105 --> 00:07:55,098
What's waiting for you, Harris?
The chair? The gas chamber?

30
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:56,200
Or just a rope?

31
00:07:56,410 --> 00:07:59,847
How do I know that line you handed me
on the phone's on the level?

32
00:07:59,915 --> 00:08:01,712
Your voice don't even sound the same.

33
00:08:01,783 --> 00:08:04,617
Neither will yours
when you put on a mask.

34
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,350
- Who else figures in it besides me?
- You ask too many questions.

35
00:08:08,489 --> 00:08:11,925
And I'm not getting any answers.
I like to know who I work with.

36
00:08:12,127 --> 00:08:14,994
When do we make the split?
And who do I take my orders from?

37
00:08:15,198 --> 00:08:16,563
Get out of here.

38
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:22,404
All right, I'll get out.

39
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:28,004
Fat choice you're giving me.
You know the bind I'm in.

40
00:08:28,376 --> 00:08:30,345
Take it or leave it.

41
00:08:32,014 --> 00:08:33,743
You said three hundred grand for my end?

42
00:08:33,816 --> 00:08:36,809
At least, free and clear,
only you do it my way.

43
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,021
Nobody sees the others without a mask,
even when we make the split,

44
00:08:40,123 --> 00:08:42,614
and I decide where and when
that takes place.

45
00:08:42,860 --> 00:08:44,623
That makes it all foolproof.

46
00:08:48,932 --> 00:08:52,925
Okay, you got yourself a boy, now what?

47
00:08:53,371 --> 00:08:57,000
Stay in your room.
Keep out of sight till I call you.

48
00:09:05,048 --> 00:09:08,246
Do a little thinking next time,
before you use it.

49
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:18,161
Don't get any wrong ideas about me.
I don't shove around this easy.

50
00:09:18,264 --> 00:09:21,165
I'll give you a chance to show me how
hot you are on the job.

51
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,892
You're a three-time loser, Tony.

52
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,086
Not yet, I ain't.

53
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:55,065
The police know
you drove the getaway car.

54
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:58,506
This time it's life and no chance of parole.

55
00:10:00,309 --> 00:10:04,209
This time, Tony, you go up for life
under the Habitual Criminal Act,

56
00:10:04,277 --> 00:10:06,007
with no chance of parole.

57
00:10:06,914 --> 00:10:08,814
You don't have to tell me the score.

58
00:10:09,417 --> 00:10:12,876
- Then it is a deal?
- Okay.

59
00:10:13,922 --> 00:10:17,323
But no dames, understand? No dames.

60
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:22,657
Look, friend, if you don't like it,

61
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,797
don't knock it.

62
00:10:37,846 --> 00:10:41,044
What makes you think I can't go on
doing all right?

63
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:44,416
If I can spot you back of those
trick cheaters so can the cops.

64
00:10:46,522 --> 00:10:50,357
This job you're talking about.
I'd said I'd listen.

65
00:10:50,427 --> 00:10:54,261
You're a cop-killer.
You killed one on that last deal.

66
00:10:55,265 --> 00:10:56,856
I don't like heroes.

67
00:10:57,433 --> 00:11:01,598
You can tell that to the warden
when they burn you.

68
00:11:06,477 --> 00:11:08,969
So, I'm still listening.

69
00:11:32,138 --> 00:11:35,835
- Why don't you watch where you're
going? - I'm sorry, lady, I didn't see you.

70
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:08,703
Here's the description, Mac.

71
00:13:08,772 --> 00:13:13,642
All units stand by, a 117.
Attention all units, a 117.

72
00:13:13,977 --> 00:13:16,503
Here's a description of the suspects
involved in the armed robbery

73
00:13:16,580 --> 00:13:19,175
of the Southwest Bank.
Three men, masked,

74
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:22,277
wearing identical coveralls.
They are driving a light delivery car

75
00:13:22,354 --> 00:13:24,685
belonging to the
Western Wholesale Florists.

76
00:13:24,755 --> 00:13:27,485
Use extreme caution. All are armed.

77
00:14:16,878 --> 00:14:18,208
Pull over.

78
00:14:26,153 --> 00:14:29,123
80 K to Control 2, on that 117,

79
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,657
we have the suspect florist truck.

80
00:14:30,825 --> 00:14:32,190
Twentieth and Jackson.

81
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:34,160
- Hey, what is this?
- Put your hands on the back of your neck

82
00:14:34,229 --> 00:14:36,390
- and come on out.
- Come on, come on, get out.

83
00:14:36,665 --> 00:14:38,132
You guys nuts?

84
00:14:38,534 --> 00:14:40,434
- Shut up.
- You, in there, come on out.

85
00:14:40,502 --> 00:14:42,298
One at a time, with your hands in the air.

86
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:47,205
All right, you, if your pals have any ideas,
you'd better start talking.

87
00:14:47,876 --> 00:14:50,003
- You're going to open it.
- Open what?

88
00:14:50,078 --> 00:14:52,206
You're crazy!
There's nothing in there but flowers.

89
00:14:52,615 --> 00:14:54,674
Open it.

90
00:15:02,191 --> 00:15:04,751
Where'd you drop them off? Come on, talk.

91
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,802
We must have rolled 300 miles.

92
00:15:18,908 --> 00:15:21,036
If they ain't dropped us by now,
they'll never get us.

93
00:15:21,111 --> 00:15:23,636
When do we make the split?

94
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,545
The split's
what I'm gonna talk about.

95
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:30,781
Four kings, a pat hand.
That's just what we're holding.

96
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,415
Hang on to those cards.

97
00:15:36,094 --> 00:15:38,617
I've got everything covered, but in case
something does go wrong

98
00:15:38,728 --> 00:15:41,961
and I can't make the payoff myself,
the cards will identify you

99
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:43,625
to whoever I send with the money.

100
00:15:43,702 --> 00:15:45,067
Say that again.

101
00:15:45,137 --> 00:15:48,538
We'll cut up the money when I think it's
had time enough to cool off.

102
00:15:48,607 --> 00:15:51,770
Right now is good enough for me.
Let's cut this horsing around.

103
00:15:51,843 --> 00:15:53,435
How far do you think you'd get
with hot money?

104
00:15:53,512 --> 00:15:55,411
Every cop in the state's out looking for us.

105
00:15:55,479 --> 00:15:57,539
- I'll take my chances.
- I told you, the mask stays on.

106
00:15:57,616 --> 00:15:59,413
Sure you told us.

107
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:05,885
It's a pat hand only because nobody can
rat on you.

108
00:16:06,893 --> 00:16:08,554
You can't even rat on each other

109
00:16:08,728 --> 00:16:10,958
because you've never seen each
other without those masks.

110
00:16:11,531 --> 00:16:13,624
I've made you cop-proof
and stoolpigeon-proof

111
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,291
and it's going to stay that way.

112
00:16:15,435 --> 00:16:18,097
- Talk money.
- All right.

113
00:16:21,407 --> 00:16:23,137
I got one of these for each of you,

114
00:16:23,210 --> 00:16:25,405
with enough money to keep you
comfortable while you're waiting,

115
00:16:25,478 --> 00:16:27,343
but not enough to get you into trouble.

116
00:16:27,413 --> 00:16:30,349
For the 300 G's that's coming to me,
I can stand a little trouble.

117
00:16:30,652 --> 00:16:33,084
Make up your mind.
Which way's it gonna be?

118
00:16:38,892 --> 00:16:40,860
You'll find tickets for where you're going.

119
00:16:41,028 --> 00:16:44,191
You're each going to a different
foreign country. Stay there

120
00:16:44,532 --> 00:16:46,625
till I wire you where and when to come,

121
00:16:47,002 --> 00:16:50,530
and keep those masks.
You'll be wearing them at the payoff.

122
00:16:51,072 --> 00:16:54,166
This is where you got off. Hit that buzzer.

123
00:16:57,512 --> 00:16:59,241
Open the door.

124
00:17:08,592 --> 00:17:09,785
Jump!

125
00:17:13,829 --> 00:17:15,694
- What about me?
- I'll tell you when.

126
00:17:27,377 --> 00:17:29,674
It's odd that you'd stop at that florists
next to the bank

127
00:17:29,745 --> 00:17:30,939
twice in the same morning.

128
00:17:31,013 --> 00:17:32,242
Once was all I was there.

129
00:17:32,314 --> 00:17:34,248
Then the woman who identified
you is a liar?

130
00:17:34,484 --> 00:17:35,883
No, she's telling the truth.
I did bump into her.

131
00:17:35,952 --> 00:17:38,580
And the other witnesses who swear
your truck was the getaway car,

132
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:39,747
they're telling the truth, too?

133
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:41,916
They're wrong if they say I had anything
to do with the robbery.

134
00:17:42,126 --> 00:17:44,287
You want me to believe
there was a duplicate truck.

135
00:17:44,362 --> 00:17:46,023
I wouldn't know. I wasn't there.

136
00:17:46,097 --> 00:17:48,429
- You were framed, then. Is that it?
- Yeah.

137
00:17:48,499 --> 00:17:51,297
And that year you spent in the pen?
Did anyone frame you on that rap?

138
00:17:52,036 --> 00:17:54,436
Ask the Captain here,
he was the arresting officer.

139
00:17:55,006 --> 00:17:56,803
A real model citizen.

140
00:17:57,376 --> 00:18:00,436
Look, just because I got in a
jam over a gambling bet

141
00:18:00,512 --> 00:18:02,377
doesn't make me a bank robber.

142
00:18:02,514 --> 00:18:05,005
- The boy wants pity.
- What about the truck?

143
00:18:05,884 --> 00:18:08,148
If I knew the answer to that,
I wouldn't be here now.

144
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:10,779
How's this for an answer?
There was no other truck.

145
00:18:11,423 --> 00:18:13,220
Listen, I...

146
00:18:15,027 --> 00:18:17,258
Mr. Andrews, here,
with the insurance company,

147
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,592
he's willing to give you a break,

148
00:18:18,665 --> 00:18:19,790
aren't you, Scott?

149
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:23,827
- He knows we are.
- Same questions, same answers.

150
00:18:23,903 --> 00:18:26,735
- You can save your breath.
- It's my job, Joe.

151
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:29,906
After all, we've got to make good the loss.

152
00:18:30,043 --> 00:18:34,207
In fact, we're willing to pay out as
much as 25 % of the money as a reward.

153
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:37,340
That's $300,000 for a lead, Joe.

154
00:18:39,053 --> 00:18:41,453
You're an industrial engineer, aren't you?

155
00:18:41,522 --> 00:18:43,751
- I never graduated.
- That's right.

156
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:46,156
Left school to enlist with the engineers.

157
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:50,692
Pretty good soldier, too.
Bronze Star, Purple Heart.

158
00:18:50,931 --> 00:18:53,195
Try and buy a cup of coffee with them.

159
00:18:53,334 --> 00:18:57,169
Came back to resume his studies at night.
Why?

160
00:18:57,471 --> 00:18:59,906
Why? I ask myself,
would a man with such training

161
00:18:59,975 --> 00:19:01,499
want to take a job outside his line?

162
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:03,975
To set up a touch for
over a million dollars, that's why.

163
00:19:05,079 --> 00:19:08,537
I got the job through the probation officer.
You can ask him.

164
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:11,549
Mr. Collins, did I ever give you any trouble
when I worked for you?

165
00:19:11,887 --> 00:19:13,912
No, Joe, not at all.

166
00:19:14,556 --> 00:19:17,218
But I'm afraid I've got to let you go now.

167
00:19:17,392 --> 00:19:20,987
Nothing personal, you understand.
It's just that... Well,

168
00:19:21,062 --> 00:19:23,792
we sell to a lot of
very conservative people.

169
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:26,560
- You know how it is.
- Yeah, I know how it is.

170
00:19:26,735 --> 00:19:29,500
Sergeant, see that Mr. Collins gets back.

171
00:19:29,805 --> 00:19:33,037
I'll go along with him.
Some questions I want to ask.

172
00:19:41,984 --> 00:19:45,010
All right, Rolfe, you want it the hard way,
I can fix that too.

173
00:19:45,087 --> 00:19:47,352
You've got 20 years staring you
right in the face.

174
00:19:47,424 --> 00:19:50,484
What do you want me to say? That I did it?

175
00:19:50,861 --> 00:19:54,855
Why don't you go ahead, Mr. Martin?
You got a big day tomorrow.

176
00:19:55,265 --> 00:19:57,996
The boys will help me keep
Rolfe company.

177
00:20:05,976 --> 00:20:08,138
What do you think, McBride?

178
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:10,013
I think if you left him to me and the boys,

179
00:20:10,081 --> 00:20:14,143
I'd have his confession on your desk,
the first thing in the morning.

180
00:20:24,629 --> 00:20:27,224
We'll be back after him,
first thing in the morning.

181
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:58,292
Extra! Extra! Get the latest news on
the big bank stickup.

182
00:20:58,366 --> 00:21:02,165
Extra!
Ex-con grilled on a million-dollar grab!

183
00:21:36,738 --> 00:21:40,800
Okay, we'll take him once more.

184
00:21:42,578 --> 00:21:45,275
You got visitors again, Rolfe.

185
00:21:51,554 --> 00:21:54,455
- Come on, move.
- McBride.

186
00:21:58,795 --> 00:22:00,627
We've got to turn him loose.

187
00:22:00,698 --> 00:22:03,667
The upstate police found a duplicate
florist truck half an hour ago.

188
00:22:04,134 --> 00:22:08,731
- It was inside an abandoned moving van.
- That still doesn't clear Rolfe, in my book.

189
00:22:08,807 --> 00:22:11,604
His part of the job could have been to use
his truck as a blind,

190
00:22:11,675 --> 00:22:13,233
to draw us away
from the real getaway car.

191
00:22:13,310 --> 00:22:15,939
- It could have been anything!
- Just give me a little more time.

192
00:22:16,047 --> 00:22:17,070
I'll sweat it out of him.

193
00:22:17,148 --> 00:22:19,514
Forget it, McBride. I've checked every
move he's made. He's clean.

194
00:22:21,286 --> 00:22:24,745
All right, Rolfe, you can go.
Sorry we had to detain you.

195
00:22:27,058 --> 00:22:29,492
- You're sorry?
- These things happen.

196
00:22:34,332 --> 00:22:37,131
Thanks for nothing.

197
00:22:38,704 --> 00:22:40,763
Go on, beat it.

198
00:22:42,641 --> 00:22:47,373
Maybe you didn't hear what I said.
I said, "For nothing."

199
00:23:01,094 --> 00:23:05,963
Extra! Extra! What do you read?
All about the big bank stickup!

200

Extra! Extra! Get the latest news

Ex-con grilled on the million-dollar grab!

00:23:12,572 --> 00:23:15,837
Get the latest news on the...

203
00:23:19,514 --> 00:23:23,211
Hey! That's him. That's the guy.

204
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:36,657
You got to do it, Rick.

205
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:38,663
You don't understand, Rick.

206
00:23:39,535 --> 00:23:42,470
I know the spot you're in,
Rick, but you gotta help Joe.

207
00:23:45,106 --> 00:23:47,268
Rick! Rick!

208
00:23:53,750 --> 00:23:55,649
- Hi, Joe.
- Hi, Eddie.

209
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:58,513
- Get you something?
- Yeah, two things,

210
00:23:59,255 --> 00:24:01,484
a cup of coffee and that
information you promised me.

211
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:05,756
It's like I told you, the first one is easy.

212
00:24:06,863 --> 00:24:11,528
Listen, Eddie, I've gotta know
who set me into this little deal.

213
00:24:11,868 --> 00:24:13,461
Did you ask him?

214
00:24:13,637 --> 00:24:15,400
You're leading with your chin, Joe.

215
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:19,407
So I'm leading with my chin.
What have I got to lose?

216
00:24:19,577 --> 00:24:22,273
Look, Eddie! It's been three weeks.
No job, no angle, no nothing.

217
00:24:22,346 --> 00:24:26,180
Hey, okay, okay.
Take it easy. I'm on your side.

218
00:24:29,119 --> 00:24:31,952
I'll get you another cup of coffee.

219
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:43,031
You come back tonight
around closing time.

220
00:25:13,432 --> 00:25:16,230
Kid brother says you're in trouble, Joe.

221
00:25:16,703 --> 00:25:19,193
I got to find a way to clear myself.

222
00:25:19,773 --> 00:25:21,968
Sometimes it's tough, Joe.

223
00:25:22,042 --> 00:25:26,103
- Sometimes it's too tough.
- Look, I want to know who framed me.

224
00:25:27,682 --> 00:25:31,412
- It wasn't anyone local that's for sure.
- Any ideas?

225
00:25:33,488 --> 00:25:34,476
Maybe.

226
00:25:35,522 --> 00:25:39,653
Might be why Pete Harris
beat it to Mexico.

227
00:25:39,727 --> 00:25:43,254
Pete Harris? Where in Mexico?

228
00:25:46,034 --> 00:25:51,564
Tijuana. Look for him where the dice roll.
He's a real sucker for a crap game.

229
00:25:53,274 --> 00:25:57,267
- Anything else?
- Kind of dark and real weird eyes.

230
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:01,580
You won't have any trouble finding him
by the cigarettes he smokes.

231
00:26:01,884 --> 00:26:06,412
- Just follow the chain.
- Much obliged.

232
00:26:07,424 --> 00:26:08,948
Good luck, Joe.

233
00:26:11,961 --> 00:26:16,456
- Take it easy, Joe.
- Thanks, kid.

234
00:26:21,137 --> 00:26:24,436
So, that's the guy that saved your life
on Iwo Jima?

235
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:28,068
I'd buy him.

236
00:27:20,533 --> 00:27:22,934
<i>I have the name of Diaz, señor.</i>

237
00:27:24,204 --> 00:27:28,333
If you are looking for a good time,
I know all the best places in Tijuana.

238
00:27:29,409 --> 00:27:31,343
Long as there's a dice table there.

239
00:27:33,112 --> 00:27:34,842
- But gambling is illegal.
- Yeah?

240
00:27:34,982 --> 00:27:37,507
<i>But like in the States, señor,</i>

241
00:27:37,584 --> 00:27:39,745
there are some things
the law does not know.

242
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:42,546
I will show you
where is a nice game of chance.

243
00:27:43,024 --> 00:27:44,685
Okay.

244
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:49,692
- All right.
- Place your bets, boys.

245
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:51,520
Place your bets.

246
00:28:06,181 --> 00:28:10,243
All right, all bets down. Coming out.
Shooter's coming out.

247
00:28:11,787 --> 00:28:13,550
- Eight of clubs.
- Eight of clubs, go!

248
00:28:19,029 --> 00:28:20,724
- Watch the dice, boys.
- Come on.

249
00:28:21,897 --> 00:28:23,261
Seven up! You lose.

250
00:28:23,331 --> 00:28:26,460
All right.
Throw that guy in the bucket if you're off...

251
00:28:28,538 --> 00:28:31,996
<i>- Know any other spots?
-Si, señor, but I lose all my money.</i>

252
00:28:36,813 --> 00:28:37,939
Come on.

253
00:28:40,150 --> 00:28:42,175
Check the card game.

254
00:28:43,453 --> 00:28:45,182
Okay, all bets. Hands off the table.

255
00:28:46,156 --> 00:28:47,680
Come on, there. Come on.

256
00:28:47,825 --> 00:28:49,588
- I'm gonna let mine ride.
- What about that?

257
00:28:51,963 --> 00:28:53,430
Light, Mac?

258
00:28:58,771 --> 00:28:59,964
Thanks.

259
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:04,966
All right, move around, everybody.

260
00:29:05,042 --> 00:29:06,669
If you're not shooting,
get away from the table.

261
00:29:06,744 --> 00:29:09,475
Let the betters in. All right, let the dice go.

262
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:12,607
- And he's coming out.
- Come on dice, get hot.

263
00:29:12,785 --> 00:29:15,152
- And he went away
with a four-trey.

264
00:29:15,288 --> 00:29:17,222
It's not your night, bud. Next shooter.

265
00:29:17,489 --> 00:29:19,285
Come on, now,
give me something on the field.

266
00:29:19,357 --> 00:29:21,553
You can't go wrong with the big six
or the big eight!

267
00:29:21,627 --> 00:29:24,653
And don't overlook that
ever loving any-craps. It's overdue, men.

268
00:29:24,797 --> 00:29:27,790
- $20, he don't hit.
- You got a bet, Mister.

269
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:32,060
Coming out,
the big miss, box cars.

270
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,964
All right, take the inside
and pay the outside.

271
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:36,804
Double up after craps, men.

272
00:29:36,877 --> 00:29:39,343
One good one makes up
for all the bad ones.

273
00:29:40,013 --> 00:29:42,140
You might as well be broke
as not have enough.

274
00:29:42,215 --> 00:29:44,013
All right, here we go.

275
00:29:44,517 --> 00:29:47,214
Let the piece ride.
I'm still saying he can't do it.

276
00:29:47,488 --> 00:29:49,149
Make him
eat those words, Mister.

277
00:29:49,223 --> 00:29:50,281
And another $20.

278
00:29:51,058 --> 00:29:55,461
There they go
and he's got nine for a number.

279
00:29:55,596 --> 00:29:57,962
He makes nine for all the money.

280
00:29:58,365 --> 00:30:01,801
- 3-to-2, you can't not.
- I'll take 50-to-25 I make it.

281
00:30:02,069 --> 00:30:04,594
No bet. It's a 3-to-2 wager.

282
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,676
I'll cover that.

283
00:30:12,180 --> 00:30:16,173
All right, boys. Come on, now.
Give me something on the field.

284
00:30:16,985 --> 00:30:19,283
And the shooter's coming out
on a gravy train.

285
00:30:20,422 --> 00:30:24,086
That devil jumped up.
He went away with seven.

286
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:26,788
Take the inside, pay the outside.

287
00:30:27,430 --> 00:30:29,227
You wanted me to tell you
when it was 10:30, fellow.

288
00:30:29,298 --> 00:30:31,493
- All right.
- All right.

289
00:30:31,667 --> 00:30:33,759
- All right, let the dice go.
- No more bets.

290
00:30:33,835 --> 00:30:34,996
Come on, dice. Get hot.

291
00:30:35,071 --> 00:30:36,231
- And he went away
with a four-trey.

292
00:30:36,305 --> 00:30:37,329
Four-trey.

293
00:30:37,406 --> 00:30:39,806
And we're coming out
with a brand new shooter.

294
00:30:39,876 --> 00:30:41,173
Don't overlook the field, men.

295
00:30:41,244 --> 00:30:43,406
Can't go wrong with a
big six and a big eight.

296
00:30:43,480 --> 00:30:45,778
Can somebody give me something for
that every loving, no-craps?

297
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,077
It's overdue, men.

298
00:30:50,087 --> 00:30:53,647
- Who's that guy, just came in?
- I don't know, some tourist. Why?

299
00:30:54,157 --> 00:30:57,490
I don't know. Gives me the willies.
He just don't smell right to me.

300
00:31:00,398 --> 00:31:01,865
So long, Diaz.

301
00:31:07,906 --> 00:31:09,999
Next shooter coming up.

302
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:15,968
- What's your hurry, fellow?
- Do you mind?

303
00:31:16,314 --> 00:31:19,545
For a guy who did all right, you seem to
be in too much of a hurry.

304
00:31:20,152 --> 00:31:22,346
- Is there a law against it?
- Maybe.

305
00:31:23,355 --> 00:31:25,585
Who sent you here, fellow?

306
00:31:26,292 --> 00:31:28,260
Diaz, the cab driver.

307
00:31:30,261 --> 00:31:31,853
Okay, fellow.

308
00:31:40,572 --> 00:31:42,096
Okay, wise guy.

309
00:31:44,778 --> 00:31:46,746
You found me. Now what?

310
00:31:48,213 --> 00:31:49,908
What's eating you?

311
00:31:49,982 --> 00:31:52,974
You've been giving me
the fish eye all night.

312
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:58,921
You better see a doctor, Mac.
You're in bad shape.

313
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:01,788
I ain't that sick.

314
00:32:02,262 --> 00:32:06,222
Then stop imagining things.
Get some rest.

315
00:33:14,204 --> 00:33:17,003
- Who is it?
- A man downstairs to see you.

316
00:33:20,111 --> 00:33:23,046
Look, you tell that guy...

317
00:33:26,718 --> 00:33:28,549
Now, you and I are gonna have a little talk.

318
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:30,144
You a cop?

319
00:33:30,221 --> 00:33:33,680
That's to teach you manners.
I'm the guy that drove a florist truck.

320
00:33:33,926 --> 00:33:35,950
I don't know what you're talking about.

321
00:33:36,027 --> 00:33:37,495
Take a good look, Pete.

322
00:33:37,829 --> 00:33:40,297
You're looking at the patsy who was
framed for the kill.

323
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,597
You got the wrong guy.

324
00:33:45,103 --> 00:33:47,595
- Lay off, will you?
- When you're ready to talk.

325
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:50,774
- You got me wrong.
- What'd you do with your cut, Pete?

326
00:33:51,444 --> 00:33:53,777
- I don't follow you.
- You will.

327
00:33:55,415 --> 00:33:57,383
There's no money in there!

328
00:34:15,203 --> 00:34:18,194
- You were one of them, weren't you?
- I don't know what you're talking about.

329
00:34:20,273 --> 00:34:24,733
Listen, this ain't my bag.
I copped it out of a car.

330
00:34:24,911 --> 00:34:27,972
- You're lying.
- Give me that.

331
00:34:32,453 --> 00:34:35,820
What's this plane ticket? This wire?
What's so interesting in Borados?

332
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:40,223
So, we start all over again.

333
00:34:41,462 --> 00:34:45,832
Go ahead, go ahead, but I still don't know
what you're talking about.

334
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:50,737
If I can't open you up,
maybe the cops can.

335
00:34:52,307 --> 00:34:53,434
Wait!

336
00:34:54,444 --> 00:34:55,637
No cops.

337
00:34:57,247 --> 00:35:01,205
- So, you were one of the gang?
- I had other reasons.

338
00:35:01,583 --> 00:35:03,643
I'm interested in this one.

339
00:35:06,055 --> 00:35:09,822
Your plane leaves in 50 minutes, Pete.
You're not gonna be on it.

340
00:35:14,130 --> 00:35:17,497
Look, I gotta get to Borados.

341
00:35:17,700 --> 00:35:20,534
That wire means 300 grand to me.

342
00:35:20,671 --> 00:35:23,196
Your cut? Who set it up?

343
00:35:23,574 --> 00:35:28,671
I don't know.
Look, we didn't have nothing against you.

344
00:35:29,013 --> 00:35:31,982
We didn't even know you.
It just fell that way.

345
00:35:32,117 --> 00:35:34,175
Lucky me! Who else was in on it?

346
00:35:34,285 --> 00:35:37,743
I don't know that either.
We all four of us wore masks.

347
00:35:37,888 --> 00:35:39,412
I thought there were only three.

348
00:35:39,557 --> 00:35:41,492
Three and the big guy.

349
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,620
Look, look, I'm giving it to you straight.

350
00:35:44,696 --> 00:35:47,689
That's the way it was planned.
We all did business with a mask.

351
00:35:48,066 --> 00:35:51,297
He could know us, but none of us
could know him. Get it?

352
00:35:51,369 --> 00:35:54,805
None of us could squeal that way
if one of us didn't get away.

353
00:35:55,774 --> 00:35:58,300
That explains everything but this.

354
00:36:00,012 --> 00:36:03,379
I won't know what that means
till I get there.

355
00:36:03,883 --> 00:36:05,852
All right, partner.

356
00:36:06,018 --> 00:36:09,182
- We'll find out together.
- Partner?

357
00:36:10,323 --> 00:36:13,451
The big man set me in on this,
so we split five ways.

358
00:36:14,761 --> 00:36:16,752
You're kidding.

359
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:20,192
If I don't split five ways,
there's gonna be no split at all.

360
00:36:20,700 --> 00:36:23,693
Okay, go ahead, hang yourself.

361
00:36:24,037 --> 00:36:26,005
- It'll be a pleasure.
- All right.

362
00:36:26,807 --> 00:36:29,901
So, I'm moving blind
but I got you for a bird dog

363
00:36:30,177 --> 00:36:35,046
- to point the way as we go along. - You
forget, even I don't know the big guy.

364
00:36:36,050 --> 00:36:39,679
So, I'm taking a chance, but remember...

365
00:36:40,288 --> 00:36:44,748
I'm taking no chances with you between
here and Borados, partner.

366
00:36:48,028 --> 00:36:51,829
Now, get ready.
We don't want to miss our plane.

367
00:37:00,843 --> 00:37:03,869
<i>Mexicana de Aviación announces
the departure of its flight...</i>

368
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:06,938
<i>- Give me some cigarettes.
- In the machine, señor.</i>

369
00:37:07,016 --> 00:37:10,110
<i>Passengers, kindly board your
plane to the local gateway.</i>

370
00:37:10,386 --> 00:37:12,651
<i>Flight 589, now boarding.</i>

371
00:37:12,789 --> 00:37:15,917
<i>Flight 589, now boarding.</i>

372
00:37:19,863 --> 00:37:21,990
- I want a ticket to Borados.
- Yes, sir.

373
00:37:22,399 --> 00:37:23,560
You just have time.

374
00:37:23,634 --> 00:37:26,727
You make connections for
Borados in Mexico City, 10:30 a.m.

375
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,330
- Round trip?
- One way.

376
00:37:30,073 --> 00:37:31,870
That will be $92, please.

377
00:37:37,348 --> 00:37:41,944
Hey, Barney, look who's here.
Over by the cigarette machine.

378
00:37:42,787 --> 00:37:45,278
Familiar?

379
00:37:46,891 --> 00:37:51,157
- That's Pete Harris. Go ahead, brace him.
- So it is.

380
00:37:52,164 --> 00:37:56,066
- Don't worry about this boy.
- You stay here.

381
00:38:06,445 --> 00:38:07,537
Cops.

382
00:38:20,993 --> 00:38:23,894
I don't get it. This man reached
for a gun and he's clean.

383
00:38:24,397 --> 00:38:27,594
<i>Don't worry, señor,
this man's wanted for murder.</i>

384
00:38:33,207 --> 00:38:34,834
All that dough...

385
00:38:37,444 --> 00:38:41,846
What's that he's trying to say
about dough? What dough, Pete?

386
00:38:43,650 --> 00:38:45,811
You haven't got a chance, Pete,
but you can go out clean.

387
00:38:45,953 --> 00:38:48,012
He's right, Pete.
Tell us about the dough.

388
00:38:49,791 --> 00:38:51,884
- Who was down here with you?
- What are you doing in Mexico?

389
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,723
Where were you going?

390
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:58,153
Got anything you want to tell us?
You haven't got a chance.

391
00:39:07,041 --> 00:39:09,704
Is he trying to tell us
that somebody's down here with him?

392
00:39:09,845 --> 00:39:11,369
Sounds like it. Maybe there is.

393
00:39:11,714 --> 00:39:14,239
The ambulance will be here at once.

394
00:39:16,152 --> 00:39:18,085
This is a laugh.

395
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:22,288
- All that dough.
- What dough?

396
00:39:23,726 --> 00:39:25,353
What dough, Pete?

397
00:39:27,062 --> 00:39:28,654
Have to ask...

398
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:31,396
- Ask who, Pete?
- Come on, Pete.

399
00:39:31,468 --> 00:39:33,801
Time's running out. Tell us. Who?

400
00:39:35,104 --> 00:39:36,093
Ask...

401
00:39:37,973 --> 00:39:41,603
Pete! Pete!

402
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,853
<i>You forgot your claim check, señor.
Your baggage is aboard the plane.</i>

403
00:40:02,701 --> 00:40:04,464
Thanks.

404
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:11,673
<i>Attention. Would Mr. Pete
Harris please board the plane?</i>

405
00:40:11,977 --> 00:40:14,171
<i>Flight 589 now leaving.</i>

406
00:40:34,533 --> 00:40:36,934
- Good morning, my customers.
- Good morning.

407
00:40:37,003 --> 00:40:39,801
It looks like maybe today
it's going to rain, finally.

408
00:40:39,873 --> 00:40:41,932
I hope so. At least it'll cool off.

409
00:40:42,041 --> 00:40:44,566
Then everyone can go outside and play.

410
00:40:44,777 --> 00:40:46,745
<i>Buenos días, Señor Kane.</i>

411
00:40:48,349 --> 00:40:53,377
<i>Well now, Señor Romano,
I see you have found something you want.</i>

412
00:40:55,055 --> 00:40:58,149
- Perhaps you will like this one.
- Yeah.

413
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:01,553
- Don't you want to buy it?
- It's not bad for a bottle.

414
00:41:02,897 --> 00:41:06,264
- How much?
- Only 11 American dollars.

415
00:41:07,002 --> 00:41:08,468
Eleven bucks?

416
00:41:08,936 --> 00:41:12,201
<i>But, of course, señor,
if you're looking for something cheap...</i>

417
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:14,866
I get nothing but the best.

418
00:41:16,177 --> 00:41:18,668
Then shall I wrap it
into a nice package for you?

419
00:41:19,948 --> 00:41:23,145
Don't bother.
I bought it for a nice package.

420
00:41:25,922 --> 00:41:28,822
<i>But señor, you're too generous.</i>

421
00:41:29,824 --> 00:41:32,385
That will be 11 American dollars.

422
00:41:36,332 --> 00:41:38,994
Charge it, with the rest.

423
00:41:48,177 --> 00:41:51,079
That Teresa, she is a jewel.

424
00:41:51,447 --> 00:41:53,678
The smartest girl that ever worked for me.

425
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:58,253
That's the 12th time she has
sold that same bottle of perfume.

426
00:41:58,789 --> 00:42:02,247
On that kind of business, I can afford
to give her 50 % commission.

427
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:07,389
<i>- Who is that vaselino?
- He came here yesterday.</i>

428
00:42:08,098 --> 00:42:09,429
You mean to tell me
you been here two hours

429
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:11,024
and not met Tony Romano?

430
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:13,261
- Come, I'll introduce you.
- Don't bother.

431
00:42:13,337 --> 00:42:16,467
Say, Tomaso, why doesn't it rain if
it's gonna?

432
00:42:16,774 --> 00:42:20,074
The one thing I have no control over,
the rain.

433
00:42:21,113 --> 00:42:25,071
Yeah, the minute I get outside, though,
it'll start coming down like...

434
00:42:26,384 --> 00:42:28,215
- Cats and dogs.
- Morning.

435
00:42:28,286 --> 00:42:31,153
<i>-Señor Foster!
- Good morning, Tomaso.</i>

436
00:42:32,057 --> 00:42:35,254
<i>- What's everybody so gloomy about?
- The weather, señor.</i>

437
00:42:35,327 --> 00:42:37,956
- She's so uncertain.
- Up in the States, they're having blizzards.

438
00:42:39,265 --> 00:42:41,859
If something like that would
only happen here.

439
00:42:42,368 --> 00:42:47,272
But no. Nothing but sunshine
and people catching fish.

440
00:42:47,573 --> 00:42:50,566
If just once a fish would catch a man.

441
00:42:50,644 --> 00:42:53,374
That's possible, Tomaso.
All depends on the bait.

442
00:42:53,813 --> 00:42:56,509
<i>Señor Foster, Señor Kane.</i>

443
00:42:56,583 --> 00:42:57,983
How do you do, Mr. Kane?

444
00:42:58,585 --> 00:43:00,554
- You look right at home here.
- Should be.

445
00:43:00,687 --> 00:43:02,678
I've been coming down here every season
for a good many years.

446
00:43:02,789 --> 00:43:05,417
<i>Señor Foster,
I have your tobacco for you.</i>

447
00:43:05,992 --> 00:43:09,827
Good, Teresa. I was almost out.

448
00:43:11,031 --> 00:43:12,658
- Good fishing.
- Thank you.

449
00:43:13,234 --> 00:43:16,068
When are you going to try your hand
at some of this fishing, Mr. Romano?

450
00:43:16,237 --> 00:43:19,230
In this heat? I got better sport.

451
00:43:21,876 --> 00:43:25,108
- How about some cards again tonight?
- I'll give you a chance to get even.

452
00:43:26,047 --> 00:43:27,776
Come early and bring a lot of money.

453
00:43:50,006 --> 00:43:51,735
Hi, Tim.

454
00:43:54,877 --> 00:43:56,105
Glad to see you, Scott.

455
00:43:56,179 --> 00:43:59,636
Well, you're certainly looking in the pink.
That little girl of yours? How is she?

456
00:44:00,249 --> 00:44:03,650
She's a big girl, now.
She's home preparing for her bar exams.

457
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:05,278
Be a lawyer any day.

458
00:44:05,354 --> 00:44:08,415
It's been years since
anyone's seen you around the old haunts.

459
00:44:08,691 --> 00:44:13,129
Yeah, two years, one month and
eight days since I got my walking papers.

460
00:44:14,598 --> 00:44:16,657
Still bitter, Tim?

461
00:44:16,734 --> 00:44:19,396
You spend 20 years of your life being a cop
and then get thrown out.

462
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,563
What am I supposed to do,
stand up and cheer?

463
00:44:21,772 --> 00:44:25,435
Well, maybe it was time to get out.
It was beginning to affect your health.

464
00:44:26,077 --> 00:44:28,636
Call it forced retirement.

465
00:44:28,713 --> 00:44:31,045
All right, Scott, forced retirement.

466
00:44:31,216 --> 00:44:33,515
"You backed the wrong party,
Captain Foster,

467
00:44:33,586 --> 00:44:35,779
"so now we've got ourselves a new boy."

468
00:44:36,287 --> 00:44:37,719
I call it a frame.

469
00:44:37,788 --> 00:44:39,757
Well, whatever it was,
you've been through it.

470
00:44:39,858 --> 00:44:42,326
It'll only stir up old memories.

471
00:44:42,561 --> 00:44:45,188
How about that urgent telegram
to meet you here?

472
00:44:45,731 --> 00:44:48,359
How far did you ever get on that
Southwest Bank job?

473
00:44:48,501 --> 00:44:50,129
Exactly nowhere!

474
00:44:51,237 --> 00:44:54,171
You must be hearing plenty from the
front office on that one.

475
00:44:55,007 --> 00:44:56,668
You don't know the half of it.

476
00:44:56,742 --> 00:45:00,542
Every bank in the country is on the alert
to spot the serial number of those bills,

477
00:45:00,914 --> 00:45:03,906
and, up to now,
not one of them has turned up.

478
00:45:04,651 --> 00:45:07,176
How'd you like to crack that job?

479
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:10,681
How would I like to find oil
in my back yard?

480
00:45:10,857 --> 00:45:13,621
I don't know, but I might be able
to deliver that gang to you.

481
00:45:13,826 --> 00:45:15,522
You wouldn't fool an old friend, Tim.

482
00:45:16,062 --> 00:45:19,395
It might not be anything, and, then again,
it could be just what you're looking for.

483
00:45:19,866 --> 00:45:23,826
I've been watching a couple of strange
characters drift in here one at a time.

484
00:45:24,338 --> 00:45:26,670
Name Boyd Kane mean anything to you?

485
00:45:26,774 --> 00:45:30,573
Kane? Yeah,
I want him for a jewelry store holdup.

486
00:45:31,813 --> 00:45:34,680
- I knew that when I sent you the wire.
- Who else?

487
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:37,181
A prize package by the name
of Tony Romano.

488
00:45:37,785 --> 00:45:40,516
Should fit into a touch like that bank job.

489
00:45:40,888 --> 00:45:42,856
They're playing it like
they don't know each other,

490
00:45:43,392 --> 00:45:46,226
but it's an old act any cop could spot,
so I listened.

491
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:48,692
Yeah, but there's supposed
to be three of them.

492
00:45:48,830 --> 00:45:52,095
That's where it begins to make sense.
Third one's due to arrive.

493
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,761
That ties in. Anything else?

494
00:45:55,871 --> 00:45:58,864
The talk is about a money split.
Big money.

495
00:45:59,141 --> 00:46:01,906
The kind that could have come out of
that Southwest Bank job.

496
00:46:01,978 --> 00:46:04,003
What a sweet break.

497
00:46:04,547 --> 00:46:08,482
They get together for a split
and put their necks right into a noose.

498
00:46:09,085 --> 00:46:11,076
How do we handle it, Tim?

499
00:46:11,387 --> 00:46:14,948
Keep out of sight until I call you.
You better line up the police.

500
00:46:15,658 --> 00:46:17,626
- Where can I reach you?
- El Nacional.

501
00:46:17,894 --> 00:46:19,658
- Thanks, Tim.
- Good.

502
00:46:19,897 --> 00:46:22,991
You any idea how
much reward this will bring in?

503
00:46:23,834 --> 00:46:25,426
Well, it should be plenty.

504
00:46:25,837 --> 00:46:29,101
25 % of what the
insurance company stand to lose,

505
00:46:29,173 --> 00:46:31,903
and that's over a quarter of a million.

506
00:46:32,676 --> 00:46:34,268
That's a lot of money.

507
00:46:34,745 --> 00:46:37,475
And you're the cop
they said was played out.

508
00:47:12,685 --> 00:47:15,711
- Do you like it?
- Nice.

509
00:47:22,228 --> 00:47:25,221
<i>Señorita Helen,
but what a surprise!</i>

510
00:47:25,299 --> 00:47:28,200
We did not expect you.

511
00:47:32,105 --> 00:47:34,574
<i>- Take care of your guest, amigo.
- But of course.</i>

512
00:47:34,642 --> 00:47:36,973
<i>- If señor wants to sign the register...
- Thanks.</i>

513
00:47:42,749 --> 00:47:44,683
<i>You are from Tijuana, Mexico, señor.</i>

514
00:47:44,786 --> 00:47:47,880
- I have a married sister living there.
- You have?

515
00:47:50,491 --> 00:47:53,928
<i>Come with me, señor.
I will show you which bungalow is yours.</i>

516
00:47:54,496 --> 00:47:57,090
- Follow me.
- I'll see you later.

517
00:47:57,299 --> 00:48:00,165
- Thanks for the company.
- My pleasure.

518
00:48:23,126 --> 00:48:25,253
- Not bad at all.
- I am Teresa.

519
00:48:25,328 --> 00:48:27,762
I sell souvenirs. You are here for fishing?

520
00:48:28,866 --> 00:48:30,458
I'm here for a vacation.

521
00:48:30,668 --> 00:48:34,104
That is good.
Then you have come to the right place.

522
00:48:35,506 --> 00:48:39,839
Tell me, that fellow playing pool,
who's he?

523
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:42,337
He's...
Wouldn't you like to buy something?

524
00:48:42,412 --> 00:48:45,143
You know, presents, souvenirs,
things to send back home.

525
00:48:46,884 --> 00:48:48,249
Maybe.

526
00:48:48,319 --> 00:48:50,515
Very special ladies' perfume?

527
00:48:51,790 --> 00:48:53,382
How about the fellow at the pool table?

528
00:48:54,092 --> 00:48:57,925
<i>That is Señor Kane. He arrived
this morning but he is not very sociable.</i>

529
00:48:58,029 --> 00:49:00,623
All the time he's chewing bubblegum.

530
00:49:01,732 --> 00:49:05,168
<i>- And the other fellow?
- You mean Señor Romano?</i>

531
00:49:05,904 --> 00:49:08,601
Now that one, he's very sociable.

532
00:49:12,411 --> 00:49:13,674
Thanks.

533
00:49:21,787 --> 00:49:24,586
You won't forget about the souvenir?

534
00:49:26,660 --> 00:49:29,127
What's a vacation without souvenirs?

535
00:50:09,338 --> 00:50:11,771
Hi, fisherman. What luck!

536
00:50:13,374 --> 00:50:14,466
Helen.

537
00:50:17,846 --> 00:50:19,940
For a minute I thought
you weren't glad to see me.

538
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:22,540
Glad to see you? You know
I'm always glad to see you, pumpkin,

539
00:50:22,618 --> 00:50:24,051
but you come barging in here...

540
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:27,055
What are you doing here? You...
I thought you had a lot of studying to do.

541
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:29,421
I've got news, Dad, important news.

542
00:50:29,492 --> 00:50:31,756
There's nothing more important
than your law exams.

543
00:50:31,827 --> 00:50:35,389
Sure there is. You are.
That's why I'm here.

544
00:50:35,465 --> 00:50:38,457
You know, being a law student
has its advantages.

545
00:50:38,535 --> 00:50:41,595
I set up a brief and brought it
to the Mayor myself.

546
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:45,505
You sound just like a lawyer.
Let's have the facts.

547
00:50:45,575 --> 00:50:47,702
All right, Dad, facts.

548
00:50:47,777 --> 00:50:50,575
I got the Commissioner
to reopen your case.

549
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:54,478
Well, don't you understand, Dad?

550
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:56,679
It's a chance for you to get back
on the force.

551
00:50:56,754 --> 00:51:00,121
Forget it. It's too late.
I don't want to get back on the force.

552
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,790
Now, look Dad,
this is your daughter, Helen.

553
00:51:02,860 --> 00:51:04,328
Don't fool me.

554
00:51:04,396 --> 00:51:07,887
I know what it's meant to you being
forced into retirement through politics.

555
00:51:07,965 --> 00:51:09,865
This is your chance to come back.

556
00:51:09,933 --> 00:51:12,926
You're not going to let pride
get in the way.

557
00:51:13,004 --> 00:51:15,438
All right, pumpkin. Thanks.

558
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:18,772
Now, you're gonna turn right around
and go home to those law books.

559
00:51:19,845 --> 00:51:22,474
I'm taking a week's vacation with study.

560
00:51:24,350 --> 00:51:27,580
Besides, I kind of like a young man
who just checked in.

561
00:51:27,653 --> 00:51:29,416
His name is Pete Harris.

562
00:51:38,298 --> 00:51:44,100
Our husbands.
Fishing all day and sleeping all night.

563
00:51:44,170 --> 00:51:46,638
This is supposed to be our vacation.

564
00:51:46,706 --> 00:51:50,540
If they'd only stay awake.
I wouldn't even mind if they played poker.

565
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:53,738
Remember, Olson?
Biggest sailfish I ever latched onto.

566
00:51:53,813 --> 00:51:55,941
Must have weighed 140,
if he weighed a pound.

567
00:51:56,016 --> 00:51:58,450
- Up ten.
- Just when I had him softened up,

568
00:51:58,519 --> 00:52:01,921
- ready to land, the leader breaks on me...
- Look, fella,

569
00:52:01,990 --> 00:52:05,117
right now, we're playing stud, remember?

570
00:52:05,192 --> 00:52:07,456
The man just boosted a ten.

571
00:52:08,629 --> 00:52:11,689
Sorry. Beats me.

572
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:15,027
Go ahead. Deal.

573
00:52:20,076 --> 00:52:22,066
Trying to outdraw me, huh?

574
00:52:22,143 --> 00:52:25,078
Maybe. You're high, bet your queens.

575
00:52:25,846 --> 00:52:28,611
- Check to you.
- Check.

576
00:52:31,820 --> 00:52:35,484
- Twenty-five...
- Just see you. Jack and Jill.

577
00:52:35,558 --> 00:52:38,221
- Three fours.
- How do you like that guy?

578
00:52:38,295 --> 00:52:39,921
<i>Souvenir, señor?</i>

579
00:52:43,165 --> 00:52:45,133
Come on over and take a hand.

580
00:52:50,440 --> 00:52:54,240
- Sit down. I'll give you a stack of chips.
- Shall I deal you in?

581
00:52:55,412 --> 00:52:57,346
Looks like you're doing all right
without me.

582
00:52:57,414 --> 00:53:02,146
<i>Señor Harris, meet Señor Foster.
He wins all the time.</i>

583
00:53:02,218 --> 00:53:04,779
<i>Señor Romano,
he lose all the time.</i>

584
00:53:05,556 --> 00:53:08,023
<i>Señor Morelli,
he worries more about fishing.</i>

585
00:53:09,660 --> 00:53:11,754
Glad to know you, gentlemen.

586
00:53:11,829 --> 00:53:14,957
I'm warning you, don't let
that Boy Scout look of Foster's fool you.

587
00:53:15,033 --> 00:53:18,866
He's had me on the hook ever since
I've been here. He's dynamite.

588
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:22,764
His daughter warned me about him.
I promise to be careful.

589
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:25,536
He hasn't learned
a man should never press bad luck.

590
00:53:25,610 --> 00:53:29,273
Yeah.
Expect to be around this tank awhile?

591
00:53:29,347 --> 00:53:31,543
I don't know. A while, maybe.

592
00:53:31,617 --> 00:53:33,414
Where you from?

593
00:53:33,485 --> 00:53:35,816
Kansas City, originally.

594
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:40,748
Used to know a girl there, swell cook.

595
00:53:41,793 --> 00:53:45,094
- You want to bet that ace of yours?
- Oh, yeah.

596
00:53:47,833 --> 00:53:50,359
Five skins. Just to bring in the suckers.

597
00:53:50,437 --> 00:53:52,769
- I'm in.
- Pass.

598
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:53,897
By me.

599
00:53:55,842 --> 00:53:59,278
- Let's make it 10 to keep them out.
- See what I mean?

600
00:54:00,246 --> 00:54:01,804
I'll call.

601
00:54:01,881 --> 00:54:03,815
Looks like you've got yourself a pigeon.

602
00:54:03,883 --> 00:54:05,942
Always room for one more, Tony.

603
00:54:13,027 --> 00:54:16,359
Well, you can cash me in.

604
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:20,366
- I think I owe you about $10.
- You're not quitting so early?

605
00:54:20,434 --> 00:54:24,165
Sure. I thought I'd take a walk through
the village before I turn in.

606
00:54:24,238 --> 00:54:27,071
Don't walk too fast. You'll be out of town
without even seeing it.

607
00:54:27,141 --> 00:54:29,075
<i>Ten dollars is right, Señor Harris.</i>

608
00:54:29,144 --> 00:54:31,237
Come back some more.
We need loser players.

609
00:54:42,224 --> 00:54:43,987
My good luck piece.

610
00:54:44,494 --> 00:54:47,429
Souvenir of the biggest pot
I ever sat in on.

611
00:54:48,531 --> 00:54:52,432
Don't let me break up the game.
See you later, gentlemen.

612
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:54,628
Good night, gentlemen.

613
00:58:25,825 --> 00:58:28,659
What's the idea, tossing my joint?

614
00:58:29,529 --> 00:58:31,463
I didn't mean nothing.

615
00:58:32,132 --> 00:58:35,294
I figured you meant to give me the office
when you dropped that card on the table.

616
00:58:36,535 --> 00:58:38,401
What's with you, chum?

617
00:58:38,472 --> 00:58:42,306
- Look, I had to be sure before I cracked.
- Go on.

618
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:46,939
It don't take no big thinking
to figure a couple of guys like us

619
00:58:47,015 --> 00:58:49,848
ain't in this bananaville on a vacation.

620
00:58:50,318 --> 00:58:53,845
Here... I'm just going for my wallet.

621
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:03,892
My calling card.

622
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:11,533
You must have been one of the guys
in the van.

623
00:59:11,607 --> 00:59:12,903
Yeah.

624
00:59:14,109 --> 00:59:15,906
You were outside doing the driving.

625
00:59:19,482 --> 00:59:23,781
I'm sorry I had to rough you up.

626
00:59:26,022 --> 00:59:27,649
No hard feelings.

627
00:59:30,161 --> 00:59:32,719
I'd have done the same in your spot.

628
00:59:34,197 --> 00:59:36,791
One will get you ten
I got the other guy uncovered too.

629
00:59:36,866 --> 00:59:38,800
- Who?
- Kane.

630
00:59:42,373 --> 00:59:43,772
Could be.

631
00:59:47,178 --> 00:59:50,806
Two more days and we'll be living it up.

632
00:59:52,083 --> 00:59:56,019
Just think, over 300,000 smackers.

633
00:59:56,087 --> 00:59:58,817
- If we get it.
- What do you mean "if"?

634
00:59:58,889 --> 01:00:00,881
Let's not kid ourselves.

635
01:00:01,959 --> 01:00:03,791
We don't even know who he is.

636
01:00:03,862 --> 01:00:06,387
We wouldn't know where to find him
if he didn't show up.

637
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:08,296
But why would he bring us here
if he ain't level?

638
01:00:08,366 --> 01:00:10,163
Search me.

639
01:00:10,235 --> 01:00:12,999
But I don't like working for someone
I don't know,

640
01:00:13,071 --> 01:00:16,302
especially if he can recognize me
and I can't recognize him.

641
01:00:16,374 --> 01:00:17,841
Neither do I.

642
01:00:20,980 --> 01:00:22,948
How about this guy Kane?

643
01:00:23,916 --> 01:00:25,247
Could he be Mr. Big?

644
01:00:25,318 --> 01:00:28,253
Are you kidding?
That gum-chewing character?

645
01:00:29,422 --> 01:00:31,014
Could be an act.

646
01:00:31,991 --> 01:00:35,085
Yeah, could be.

647
01:00:37,397 --> 01:00:38,864
You know,

648
01:00:40,701 --> 01:00:44,398
I think I'll get myself some gum.

649
01:00:44,471 --> 01:00:47,132
Yeah. I got you.

650
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:48,702
See you.

651
01:01:25,948 --> 01:01:27,176
Hi!

652
01:01:37,393 --> 01:01:39,885
- Hi!
- How did you make out?

653
01:01:39,963 --> 01:01:42,363
A few more hands
and your father would break me.

654
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,423
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

655
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:47,561
That's all right.
I'll get even tomorrow night.

656
01:01:48,137 --> 01:01:51,130
Now, that's one thing
I don't understand about men.

657
01:01:51,208 --> 01:01:52,402
What's that?

658
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:56,071
Well, you work hard all year and
do nothing but talk about your vacation.

659
01:01:56,147 --> 01:01:59,241
Then, when it comes,
you sit indoors and play cards.

660
01:01:59,317 --> 01:02:02,012
Yeah. It doesn't figure, does it?

661
01:02:02,086 --> 01:02:04,281
A lot of things don't figure.

662
01:02:04,688 --> 01:02:06,383
Like for instance?

663
01:02:06,456 --> 01:02:10,018
Well, for instance, what you do all year?

664
01:02:12,731 --> 01:02:14,722
I save up to play cards.

665
01:02:17,803 --> 01:02:21,294
I guess I should have brought along a
deck of cards instead of a swimming suit.

666
01:02:21,372 --> 01:02:24,466
I'd say you did the right thing.

667
01:02:24,542 --> 01:02:26,271
You can swim too?

668
01:02:26,344 --> 01:02:28,210
Like you play cards.

669
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:30,908
I'll tell you what. I'll meet you
at the pool tomorrow morning.

670
01:02:30,984 --> 01:02:34,215
- You teach me and I'll teach you.
- That's a deal.

671
01:03:00,080 --> 01:03:01,377
Thanks.

672
01:03:53,102 --> 01:03:55,263
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

673
01:03:56,273 --> 01:03:58,763
Do you always bring a book along
when you have a date?

674
01:03:58,841 --> 01:04:01,140
Well, it depends on the date.

675
01:04:01,578 --> 01:04:02,909
Let's see.

676
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,611
<i>Civil Code of the State of Missouri,
Rules and Procedure?</i>

677
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:11,882
- Translation?
- I'm cramming for the bar exams.

678
01:04:12,722 --> 01:04:14,453
No cracks, please.

679
01:04:17,595 --> 01:04:21,292
Don't tell me you're opposed
to the higher education of the female?

680
01:04:21,366 --> 01:04:25,666
No, it's just that you don't look like
a lawyer to me.

681
01:04:26,939 --> 01:04:29,964
Well, I've found that people rarely look
like what they are.

682
01:04:30,041 --> 01:04:32,407
Now, take yourself, for instance.

683
01:04:32,477 --> 01:04:36,277
To look at you, I'd say
you were probably a fisherman.

684
01:04:36,347 --> 01:04:40,478
Instead, you're probably a salesman?

685
01:04:41,787 --> 01:04:43,346
Would you like it if I were a salesman?

686
01:04:43,423 --> 01:04:48,087
Now, look, I'm the one that's supposed
to get the answers by cross-examination.

687
01:04:48,161 --> 01:04:52,654
I've always heard that the best witnesses
are the ones who want to answer.

688
01:04:53,565 --> 01:04:55,500
Thanks for the advice.

689
01:04:55,568 --> 01:04:58,058
I got some more for you, and for free, too.

690
01:04:58,137 --> 01:05:02,837
Always arrange to have your cases
tried in front of all-male juries.

691
01:05:02,909 --> 01:05:04,707
You can't lose, kid.

692
01:05:05,912 --> 01:05:08,107
Hey, you're beginning to sound
promising again.

693
01:05:16,657 --> 01:05:20,115
I left my cigarettes up at the cabin.
I'll be right back.

694
01:05:24,833 --> 01:05:26,265
Mr. Harris.

695
01:05:27,668 --> 01:05:29,067
Milkman?

696
01:05:30,372 --> 01:05:31,804
Iceman?

697
01:06:06,275 --> 01:06:08,106
Good morning, Mr. Foster.

698
01:06:08,177 --> 01:06:10,941
Hello. How about some cards tonight?

699
01:06:11,013 --> 01:06:13,778
I can't. I got a dinner date with a lawyer.

700
01:06:13,850 --> 01:06:16,411
She may never get to be one
if she's kept from her studies.

701
01:06:16,487 --> 01:06:18,250
Well, she has to eat sometime.

702
01:06:18,322 --> 01:06:20,256
- Why don't you join us?
- I'd like to.

703
01:06:20,324 --> 01:06:22,292
Good. I'll see you then.

704
01:07:30,898 --> 01:07:32,195
Get up.

705
01:07:33,234 --> 01:07:35,395
You hear what he said, palsie?

706
01:07:36,571 --> 01:07:38,596
Smart boy didn't hear you.

707
01:07:43,211 --> 01:07:46,180
What's the matter, palsie,
your ears stuffed?

708
01:07:51,853 --> 01:07:53,878
I think he hears you now.

709
01:07:54,891 --> 01:07:56,049
See?

710
01:08:06,768 --> 01:08:08,464
He's cooperating.

711
01:08:09,605 --> 01:08:11,301
Ain't you, palsie?

712
01:08:12,942 --> 01:08:14,408
What is this?

713
01:08:15,110 --> 01:08:17,705
Smart boy, here, wants to know
what is this?

714
01:08:17,780 --> 01:08:19,509
What's your line, Mister?

715
01:08:20,817 --> 01:08:22,011
He knows.

716
01:08:22,819 --> 01:08:25,618
You make me for a sucker, palsie?

717
01:08:25,689 --> 01:08:26,849
I don't like that.

718
01:08:31,061 --> 01:08:32,493
You're crazy.

719
01:08:39,069 --> 01:08:41,128
I'll pinpoint it for you, chum.

720
01:08:41,940 --> 01:08:45,171
Pete Harris and me did
a deuce together at Joliet.

721
01:08:46,945 --> 01:08:48,708
That makes you a phony.

722
01:08:49,748 --> 01:08:53,046
And now we're going to take
a nice quiet walk.

723
01:08:53,117 --> 01:08:57,646
And when we get to the right place
you're gonna tell us the story of your life.

724
01:08:57,722 --> 01:08:59,155
I don't move.

725
01:09:00,258 --> 01:09:03,887
Yeah, make a noise.
Bring the cops in on you.

726
01:09:04,596 --> 01:09:06,827
Smart boy wants it done quiet.

727
01:09:16,075 --> 01:09:17,406
Come in.

728
01:09:21,847 --> 01:09:24,247
Pardon me. I didn't know you had visitors.

729
01:09:24,317 --> 01:09:26,513
That's all right. Come on in.

730
01:09:28,388 --> 01:09:30,822
Miss Foster, you know Mr. Romano?

731
01:09:31,357 --> 01:09:32,655
Mr. Kane.

732
01:09:32,725 --> 01:09:35,490
I've seen Mr. Romano around.
How do you do, Mr. Kane?

733
01:09:35,562 --> 01:09:36,756
Hello.

734
01:09:37,597 --> 01:09:41,033
They were trying to talk me
into taking a walk with them.

735
01:09:41,101 --> 01:09:42,398
I explained we had a date.

736
01:09:42,469 --> 01:09:45,438
- I don't mind.
- I told them you wouldn't.

737
01:09:46,407 --> 01:09:48,465
Just a couple of nature-lovers.

738
01:09:48,542 --> 01:09:51,409
We were chatting about it
when you knocked.

739
01:09:51,846 --> 01:09:55,577
Well, it must have been
a very warm discussion.

740
01:09:57,953 --> 01:10:01,150
I just dropped in to return this to you.

741
01:10:01,223 --> 01:10:02,451
Thanks.

742
01:10:03,691 --> 01:10:05,455
I hardly missed it.

743
01:10:06,527 --> 01:10:08,995
I only carry it in case of snakes.

744
01:10:11,332 --> 01:10:12,731
We'll be seeing you, Harris.

745
01:10:13,469 --> 01:10:14,595
Yeah.

746
01:10:17,841 --> 01:10:22,676
Hey, Tony, I know a sure cure
for a nose-bleed.

747
01:10:23,279 --> 01:10:25,974
A cold knife in the middle of the back!

748
01:10:33,957 --> 01:10:37,017
Nice guys, playful.

749
01:10:40,798 --> 01:10:43,925
Don't bother making up any stories for me.

750
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:47,595
I thought the law said a man
was innocent until proven guilty.

751
01:10:47,670 --> 01:10:49,433
That's right.

752
01:10:49,506 --> 01:10:52,135
Considering the circumstantial evidence,

753
01:10:52,209 --> 01:10:55,508
if you were my attorney,
how would you advise me to answer?

754
01:10:55,579 --> 01:10:59,709
I'd tell you not to answer at all,
unless you could answer honestly.

755
01:11:00,352 --> 01:11:02,342
It might incriminate you.

756
01:11:03,521 --> 01:11:06,252
Now you're giving me some good advice.

757
01:11:06,324 --> 01:11:07,551
Thanks.

758
01:11:08,559 --> 01:11:10,118
And for free.

759
01:13:42,254 --> 01:13:44,723
<i>Señor Kane,
I have been looking for you.</i>

760
01:13:44,791 --> 01:13:46,759
I have a letter for you.

761
01:13:47,126 --> 01:13:49,458
She smells like a business one.

762
01:14:02,977 --> 01:14:05,844
<i>Buenos tardes, my customers,
buenos tardes.</i>

763
01:14:06,413 --> 01:14:09,246
<i>Señor Romano, a letter for you.</i>

764
01:14:10,384 --> 01:14:13,649
This one...
She also smells like a business one.

765
01:14:19,461 --> 01:14:21,258
<i>A letter for you, Señor Harris.</i>

766
01:14:21,463 --> 01:14:23,488
- Thanks.
- You're very welcome.

767
01:14:23,565 --> 01:14:24,896
Excuse me.

768
01:14:35,744 --> 01:14:37,302
Mail from home.

769
01:14:38,313 --> 01:14:39,713
It'll wait.

770
01:14:40,850 --> 01:14:43,876
I expect you to get in
some solid study tonight.

771
01:14:43,953 --> 01:14:46,284
Well, isn't that nice of you.

772
01:14:46,354 --> 01:14:47,787
How's that, Mr. Foster?

773
01:14:47,856 --> 01:14:49,791
Thanks for that and the dinner.

774
01:14:49,859 --> 01:14:53,795
Don't forget.
I may ask questions tomorrow.

775
01:14:53,863 --> 01:14:55,330
Well, I'll look forward to it.

776
01:14:56,499 --> 01:14:57,865
Good night.

777
01:15:00,937 --> 01:15:04,202
Tony, you're not even looking at
how pretty they are.

778
01:15:04,274 --> 01:15:07,038
And only 11 American dollars.

779
01:15:07,110 --> 01:15:10,011
Everything around here is 11 bucks.

780
01:15:10,080 --> 01:15:12,776
Tony, you like?

781
01:15:14,085 --> 01:15:15,449
Charge it with the rest.

782
01:15:16,620 --> 01:15:19,055
- Tony?
- See you later.

783
01:15:24,361 --> 01:15:28,492
- I see you got your invitation, Tony.
- Yeah.

784
01:15:29,867 --> 01:15:32,199
How about your friend out there?

785
01:15:32,637 --> 01:15:34,196
He get his too?

786
01:15:35,106 --> 01:15:36,767
Let's go ask him.

787
01:15:47,686 --> 01:15:51,918
Pumpkin, it isn't often
I butt into your affairs,

788
01:15:51,990 --> 01:15:55,085
but I'm gonna make like a father.

789
01:15:55,161 --> 01:15:56,525
You sound serious.

790
01:15:56,596 --> 01:15:58,723
Where you're concerned
I'm always serious.

791
01:15:59,299 --> 01:16:01,732
I want you to forget that fellow.

792
01:16:02,969 --> 01:16:05,596
But you don't know anything
about him, Dad.

793
01:16:05,671 --> 01:16:07,195
Neither do you.

794
01:16:18,252 --> 01:16:19,878
Right in there...

795
01:16:34,101 --> 01:16:37,469
- Drop the gun in the well, Kane.
- Do as he tells you.

796
01:16:41,143 --> 01:16:42,770
In the well.

797
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:48,206
- Do it!
- The gun, Kane.

798
01:16:48,284 --> 01:16:49,876
Don't! Don't!

799
01:16:51,286 --> 01:16:52,879
Go on. Drop it!

800
01:16:53,955 --> 01:16:55,321
Drop it.

801
01:17:01,396 --> 01:17:02,920
Don't shoot!

802
01:17:03,900 --> 01:17:05,333
Drop it. In the well.

803
01:17:05,401 --> 01:17:07,266
Do what he tells you.

804
01:17:08,071 --> 01:17:10,368
- Don't shoot!
- In the well.

805
01:17:10,439 --> 01:17:13,307
Do it. Get rid of it.

806
01:17:20,551 --> 01:17:24,714
All right, you two knuckle-heads,
now you're gonna listen to me,

807
01:17:24,788 --> 01:17:27,723
unless you want to join the guns
in the well.

808
01:17:27,792 --> 01:17:32,160
I got my invitation to the party.
I take Pete Harris' share.

809
01:17:32,229 --> 01:17:34,754
You gave Harris the double-shuffle.

810
01:17:34,832 --> 01:17:36,390
You got it wrong, pal.

811
01:17:36,466 --> 01:17:40,130
The cops paid him off in full,
like gambling.

812
01:17:40,205 --> 01:17:44,301
A man puts up his bet.
He's entitled to be paid off if he wins.

813
01:17:44,742 --> 01:17:46,210
Harris lost.

814
01:17:46,878 --> 01:17:48,505
What did you put up?

815
01:17:49,013 --> 01:17:52,381
A possible 20 years in stir.

816
01:17:52,451 --> 01:17:54,543
You're looking at the guy
who was framed for the job.

817
01:17:54,619 --> 01:17:57,349
That's why I'm cutting myself in
whether you like it or not.

818
01:17:57,422 --> 01:18:00,880
You're smart, you'll play along with me.

819
01:18:00,959 --> 01:18:04,396
You're not, it goes rough on everybody.

820
01:18:06,232 --> 01:18:11,726
You talk awfully green for a smart guy.
What happens when Mr. Big sees you?

821
01:18:12,705 --> 01:18:15,173
Let's wait till we get to that, huh?

822
01:18:15,241 --> 01:18:21,340
Now you two boys make like friends.
Go to sleep. Go on!

823
01:18:24,551 --> 01:18:29,818
And in case you get any ideas
about visiting me later, forget it.

824
01:18:30,690 --> 01:18:32,214
I sleep light.

825
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:13,433
What are you doing here?

826
01:19:13,502 --> 01:19:16,301
Simple. I came looking for you.

827
01:19:16,372 --> 01:19:17,964
It's a matter of principle, Mr. Harris.

828
01:19:18,041 --> 01:19:22,035
I just don't like anybody running
out on me twice in the same day.

829
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:24,511
I see. Well, you see, after I got the letter...

830
01:19:24,580 --> 01:19:27,413
I told you, you didn't have make up
any stories for me.

831
01:19:27,816 --> 01:19:29,682
That's right, you did.

832
01:19:31,021 --> 01:19:34,751
Look, Pete, I know I may be butting
into something I shouldn't,

833
01:19:34,824 --> 01:19:37,385
but that's the way I am.

834
01:19:37,461 --> 01:19:41,056
Even when I was a kid,
I was always the one asking questions.

835
01:19:42,166 --> 01:19:45,101
I bet you even cross-examined
your nurse, huh?

836
01:19:45,169 --> 01:19:48,832
You know, if I were smart, I'd find myself
another date and forget all about you.

837
01:19:49,606 --> 01:19:52,576
Only I can't help feeling you're in trouble.

838
01:19:53,444 --> 01:19:56,778
I liked it better this afternoon
when you stopped asking questions.

839
01:19:57,682 --> 01:19:59,947
I'm no fool, Pete.

840
01:20:00,019 --> 01:20:04,181
I've been around cops long enough
to pick up a few tricks of the trade.

841
01:20:04,254 --> 01:20:07,156
Those playmates of yours
are pretty obvious.

842
01:20:08,026 --> 01:20:09,721
What have they got on you?

843
01:20:09,794 --> 01:20:12,025
One question at a time.

844
01:20:12,098 --> 01:20:14,066
This specialty in cops.
Where did you pick that up?

845
01:20:14,133 --> 01:20:16,658
Well, my father
is a retired captain of police.

846
01:20:17,236 --> 01:20:20,171
I see. That explains your being a lawyer.

847
01:20:20,239 --> 01:20:21,968
Papa nails them and you free them.
Is that it?

848
01:20:22,041 --> 01:20:23,837
- What's that got to do with it?
- Look, you're a nice girl,

849
01:20:23,908 --> 01:20:25,968
but in case you're thinking
of mothering me, forget it.

850
01:20:26,045 --> 01:20:29,310
I'm no stray dog you can pick up
and I like my neck without a collar.

851
01:20:29,382 --> 01:20:30,849
Now get lost!

852
01:20:33,820 --> 01:20:39,053
Now I'm supposed to be hurt,
maybe even cry, but I won't.

853
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:41,321
I think you're in trouble
and I'm going to help you.

854
01:20:41,395 --> 01:20:45,957
Listen, sister, forget it.
Mind your own business.

855
01:21:11,493 --> 01:21:13,393
...then you move in.

856
01:21:13,462 --> 01:21:17,193
<i>- You got it now, Scott?
-Yeah, let me check back.</i>

857
01:21:17,500 --> 01:21:20,593
They meet out on the boat tomorrow
at dawn for the split.

858
01:21:20,669 --> 01:21:24,332
I wait out on the police boat
for your light signal, then I move in.

859
01:21:24,907 --> 01:21:28,344
<i>- And you answer my signal first.
-Right.</i>

860
01:21:28,411 --> 01:21:30,140
<i>- Scott.
-Yeah?</i>

861
01:21:30,213 --> 01:21:31,237
Don't miss.

862
01:21:31,314 --> 01:21:35,752
<i>- Don't worry. I won't.
-Good luck.</i>

863
01:22:26,771 --> 01:22:31,402
Well, pumpkin,
I thought you'd be asleep by this time.

864
01:22:31,477 --> 01:22:33,774
I've been waiting for you, Dad.

865
01:22:36,849 --> 01:22:39,875
- Got a little problem?
- Yeah.

866
01:22:40,586 --> 01:22:43,077
You used to have them pretty often
when you were younger.

867
01:22:43,156 --> 01:22:46,251
I always knew
when something was troubling you.

868
01:22:46,726 --> 01:22:48,786
Matter of fact, I kind of miss it.

869
01:22:48,862 --> 01:22:51,330
Were they very tough problems
I used to bring to you, Dad?

870
01:22:51,931 --> 01:22:55,992
Very tough. Some new trinkets
you wanted and money for the movies.

871
01:22:56,068 --> 01:22:57,626
That time you got into your first formal

872
01:22:57,704 --> 01:23:00,571
and your beau came down
with the measles.

873
01:23:00,641 --> 01:23:02,165
That was a tough one.

874
01:23:02,243 --> 01:23:05,337
Finally had to take you out myself
that night.

875
01:23:11,419 --> 01:23:14,513
Once you even wanted to know when
we'd get you a new ma to look after you.

876
01:23:14,889 --> 01:23:17,152
That was a real tough one.

877
01:23:17,692 --> 01:23:20,752
Most of them, though,
we were able to work out.

878
01:23:23,031 --> 01:23:26,125
You were right about Harris, Dad.
He's in a jam.

879
01:23:28,904 --> 01:23:32,772
I forgot to tell you,
you used to take my advice.

880
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:37,038
In those days, you wouldn't have gone
running after him if I'd asked you not to.

881
01:23:37,111 --> 01:23:41,446
I want you to help him, Dad.
That way you'll be helping me.

882
01:23:43,486 --> 01:23:46,649
Why? Professional interest?

883
01:23:46,723 --> 01:23:50,556
I don't really know, Dad,
but something's happened.

884
01:23:50,793 --> 01:23:55,697
I know it sounds crazy and illogical,
but that's the way it is.

885
01:23:57,734 --> 01:24:00,703
He's out of bounds for you, Helen,
way out of bounds.

886
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:02,397
You said that before. Why?

887
01:24:02,472 --> 01:24:04,600
- Isn't it enough that I tell you?
- Not this time.

888
01:24:04,675 --> 01:24:06,040
All right.

889
01:24:07,077 --> 01:24:08,635
He's an ex-con.

890
01:24:10,313 --> 01:24:12,179
I just didn't want to hit you
over the head with it.

891
01:24:13,283 --> 01:24:14,478
What else do you know about him?

892
01:24:14,552 --> 01:24:16,179
- Isn't that enough?
- No, it's not.

893
01:24:16,254 --> 01:24:18,085
There's more. There's got to be more.

894
01:24:18,155 --> 01:24:21,785
You wouldn't be so positive
if there weren't something...

895
01:24:21,860 --> 01:24:23,725
What else have you got against him?

896
01:24:23,795 --> 01:24:25,853
You're going home tonight, young lady.

897
01:24:25,930 --> 01:24:28,626
Is that the way you solved my problems
when I was a kid?

898
01:24:28,699 --> 01:24:30,895
- This is for your own good.
- Is it?

899
01:24:30,969 --> 01:24:34,996
Believe me. Believe me, pumpkin,
go home and forget him.

900
01:24:36,341 --> 01:24:41,746
You... You can start the ball rolling
on that re-hearing, and I'll be...

901
01:24:41,814 --> 01:24:42,974
Helen?

902
01:26:43,541 --> 01:26:45,874
Good morning, palsies. Hold it.

903
01:26:47,179 --> 01:26:49,374
You'll never learn, will you?

904
01:27:06,899 --> 01:27:10,961
Good morning. Don't tell me
you boys are going fishing too?

905
01:27:11,037 --> 01:27:14,734
Yeah, we see you get such a kick out of it.
We decided to give it a try.

906
01:27:14,808 --> 01:27:16,035
Great sport.

907
01:27:16,109 --> 01:27:18,509
I'm on my way to the pier.
Can I give you a lift?

908
01:27:18,578 --> 01:27:20,809
You got yourself a passenger.

909
01:27:27,888 --> 01:27:32,187
You might as well take us all, seeing that
the three of us are going fishing.

910
01:27:32,559 --> 01:27:34,619
Did you rent a boat?

911
01:27:34,695 --> 01:27:38,096
Yeah, we got us a boat called the Mañana.

912
01:28:10,665 --> 01:28:13,999
I understand you're an ex-Captain
of Police, Mr. Foster.

913
01:28:14,570 --> 01:28:16,561
That was a long time ago.

914
01:28:16,639 --> 01:28:19,767
Hey, we'll be able to match
fish stories tonight, huh?

915
01:28:19,842 --> 01:28:22,141
Sure. I'll bring pictures.

916
01:28:47,938 --> 01:28:49,372
Quite a boat.

917
01:28:51,276 --> 01:28:52,300
Yeah.

918
01:28:54,980 --> 01:28:57,447
Any kind of luck,
we all ought to do pretty good.

919
01:28:57,515 --> 01:28:59,073
Coming, Harris?

920
01:29:08,928 --> 01:29:10,293
Good luck.

921
01:29:12,097 --> 01:29:13,325
Thanks.

922
01:30:09,124 --> 01:30:10,352
Hold it.

923
01:30:38,022 --> 01:30:39,249
Freeze.

924
01:30:44,828 --> 01:30:47,126
I'll go see if he's still there.

925
01:30:53,170 --> 01:30:56,367
What's the matter, palsie?
Run out of talk?

926
01:31:02,379 --> 01:31:04,280
Not quite.

927
01:31:04,349 --> 01:31:07,477
I got a proposition.
I know where the money is.

928
01:31:08,754 --> 01:31:10,084
Right here on the boat.

929
01:31:11,289 --> 01:31:12,813
I'll show you.

930
01:31:13,726 --> 01:31:16,922
All right, look for yourself.

931
01:31:17,529 --> 01:31:20,464
Right in the cupboard there.
Go ahead. Look.

932
01:31:32,745 --> 01:31:35,771
$1,200,000, Tony.

933
01:31:35,848 --> 01:31:40,182
Think of it, $1,200,000 for you and me.

934
01:31:41,887 --> 01:31:44,584
Why cut the take four ways
when we only have to cut it two?

935
01:31:46,026 --> 01:31:48,518
That's over a half a million a piece.

936
01:31:48,929 --> 01:31:50,897
Over half a million.

937
01:31:52,499 --> 01:31:54,296
Why split with Kane?

938
01:31:58,572 --> 01:31:59,596
Okay, Tony...

939
01:32:17,593 --> 01:32:19,151
Why a two-way split?

940
01:32:21,196 --> 01:32:24,290
A guy living big all the time
like me needs dough.

941
01:32:26,236 --> 01:32:29,865
- So long, sucker.
- Drop it, Tony. Right in front of you.

942
01:32:32,206 --> 01:32:33,766
Kick it over here.

943
01:32:36,145 --> 01:32:38,671
Move back. Back up.

944
01:32:42,285 --> 01:32:44,150
- I don't get it.
- You will.

945
01:32:44,220 --> 01:32:47,121
Let's just take it easy
till the police get here.

946
01:32:49,527 --> 01:32:52,086
A little falling out over the split?

947
01:32:52,162 --> 01:32:55,620
- You get around a lot for a fisherman.
- Part of my job.

948
01:32:55,698 --> 01:32:56,996
Ex-cop.

949
01:32:57,634 --> 01:32:59,226
Making out like he knows from nothing.

950
01:32:59,302 --> 01:33:02,329
All depends on
what the assignment calls for.

951
01:33:02,406 --> 01:33:05,068
You never had a chance.
We had the big guy from the beginning.

952
01:33:06,944 --> 01:33:10,607
Don't let that bother you, Tony.
It was all marked anyway.

953
01:33:10,981 --> 01:33:14,417
- We should have figured that.
- That's right, Joe.

954
01:33:16,721 --> 01:33:18,484
The name is Pete.

955
01:33:19,558 --> 01:33:22,186
Like in Pete Harris who was shot
and killed in Tijuana?

956
01:33:28,767 --> 01:33:31,201
Something bothering you, Joe?

957
01:33:31,604 --> 01:33:33,002
Yeah.

958
01:33:33,272 --> 01:33:35,603
The only person who would know
Pete Harris was in Tijuana

959
01:33:35,674 --> 01:33:39,839
would be the one who sent him there
to hide out and wait for a wire.

960
01:33:42,114 --> 01:33:44,379
You're a boy with a lot of ideas.

961
01:33:44,450 --> 01:33:48,511
Sure, like only a cop would know
you couldn't use $1,200,000 in hot cash,

962
01:33:48,588 --> 01:33:51,853
but you could trade it in
for a nice clean reward.

963
01:33:52,592 --> 01:33:54,082
Got it all figured out?

964
01:33:55,595 --> 01:33:59,157
Three little patsies, one down, two to go.

965
01:33:59,233 --> 01:34:02,566
Your being there to give us a lift,
the money on a platter,

966
01:34:02,636 --> 01:34:04,933
honey for the bees, huh, Captain Foster?

967
01:34:05,005 --> 01:34:07,371
- Stay where you are!
- Sure, sure.

968
01:34:08,208 --> 01:34:12,578
We'll wait till the cops arrive,
try my story on for size.

969
01:34:13,047 --> 01:34:16,073
If I'm wrong I'll apologize.

970
01:35:22,520 --> 01:35:24,044
Forget it.

971
01:35:25,189 --> 01:35:27,657
My luck had to give out some time.

972
01:35:30,429 --> 01:35:35,230
I wouldn't mind so much, Joe,
if Helen didn't have to find out.

973
01:35:42,841 --> 01:35:46,675
You're not part of this.
You've got a break coming.

974
01:35:53,319 --> 01:35:55,879
Tim? What's happened? Are you hurt?

975
01:35:56,323 --> 01:35:58,289
What's Rolfe doing here?

976
01:35:59,158 --> 01:36:02,821
I've been saving him, surprise for you.

977
01:36:04,163 --> 01:36:06,495
It was his lead turned the trick.

978
01:36:08,168 --> 01:36:12,798
Only it didn't come off the way
we planned it. Did it, Joe?

979
01:36:19,580 --> 01:36:20,774
No.

980
01:36:22,182 --> 01:36:23,740
No, it didn't.

981
01:36:30,892 --> 01:36:35,089
Third guy was Pete Harris,
burned down in Tijuana.

982
01:36:36,430 --> 01:36:41,164
Scott, if anybody deserves a reward,

983
01:36:42,537 --> 01:36:43,970
it's him.

984
01:36:44,573 --> 01:36:46,666
Let's get him to a doctor.

985
01:36:46,776 --> 01:36:50,735
No. Give her my love, Joe.

986
01:36:51,814 --> 01:36:53,246
Thanks.

987
01:37:09,933 --> 01:37:12,594
I know it's just talk now, Helen,

988
01:37:12,668 --> 01:37:16,765
but I feel the loss of your father
as keenly as you do.

989
01:37:16,840 --> 01:37:19,206
I owe him a lot for what he did.

990
01:37:19,276 --> 01:37:23,235
And if there's anything that you ever need,
will you call on me?

991
01:37:24,649 --> 01:37:26,412
Thanks, Mr. Andrews.

992
01:37:27,251 --> 01:37:31,346
And one other thing about Joe Rolfe.

993
01:37:31,421 --> 01:37:33,287
He's a fine boy.

994
01:37:33,357 --> 01:37:37,953
That scrape he got into a long time ago,
he's more than made up for it.

995
01:37:38,329 --> 01:37:42,323
And the way I feel, my company
will underwrite him anytime.

996
01:37:43,668 --> 01:37:46,297
I tried so hard to make Dad understand.

997
01:37:46,672 --> 01:37:48,162
You did, Helen.

998
01:37:48,240 --> 01:37:51,835
The last thing he said was for Joe
to give you his love.

999
01:38:02,222 --> 01:38:03,985
How's she taking it, Mr. Andrews?

1000
01:38:04,057 --> 01:38:07,685
Pretty good, Joe, she's had time
to get over the shock.

1001
01:38:07,759 --> 01:38:11,092
But a hero's medal isn't enough
when you're alone.

1002
01:38:11,163 --> 01:38:13,632
She and her dad were pretty close.

1003
01:38:13,832 --> 01:38:16,427
- I told her about you.
- What'd she say?

1004
01:38:16,503 --> 01:38:18,368
Why don't you ask her?
