1
00:01:58,077 --> 00:02:00,121
People ought to be ashamed of themselves,

2
00:02:00,204 --> 00:02:02,706
kicking up all that racket
at this time of night.

3
00:02:24,895 --> 00:02:26,772
What is it? Is it a fire?

4
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:31,235
Well, why can't they knock quietly?

5
00:02:32,987 --> 00:02:35,322
Oh, blast it. We never...

6
00:02:36,949 --> 00:02:39,451
It's about three doors down.

7
00:02:41,537 --> 00:02:43,247
That's where Diana Baring is staying.

8
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:46,375
I say, there's a policeman coming already.

9
00:02:46,458 --> 00:02:49,170
- Where?
- Why, just coming around the corn...

10
00:02:49,253 --> 00:02:51,547
Well, that's funny. I could've sworn.

11
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:54,675
No, you're right. Look, there he is,
coming down the side of the road.

12
00:02:57,845 --> 00:03:00,472
I say, that's Druce that's knocking.

13
00:03:00,556 --> 00:03:03,058
Looks as though he's tight again.

14
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,978
Here. Here, where's my trousers?
I'd better go down.

15
00:03:06,061 --> 00:03:08,480
- What's this about, eh?
- I want my wife!

16
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:13,152
- She's in this house here.
- Take her home!

17
00:03:13,235 --> 00:03:15,112
What, at this time of night?

18
00:03:18,949 --> 00:03:20,492
My wife, Edna!

19
00:03:21,202 --> 00:03:25,748
We came here to have supper
with Diana Baring.

20
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:27,791
She's up...

21
00:03:28,667 --> 00:03:29,752
Wait for me. I'm coming.

22
00:03:29,835 --> 00:03:32,155
I can't stop now.
I gotta see what's the matter with Druce.

23
00:03:33,505 --> 00:03:35,299
What's the matter, Mr. Druce?
Anything wrong?

24
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:37,218
I want my wife!

25
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,136
Will you please take this man away?

26
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:40,780
Come along now, Druce.
There's a good fellow.

27
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:42,056
No. Stop it.

28
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:45,476
Here! Open this door, will you?

29
00:03:45,559 --> 00:03:46,936
Open this door!

30
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:49,230
- Hold on one second.
- Open the door!

31
00:03:53,192 --> 00:03:54,472
- Open the door!
- Open the door!

32
00:03:54,526 --> 00:03:56,320
Open the door, for the love of God!

33
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:58,530
Open the door, for God's sake.

34
00:04:42,825 --> 00:04:45,452
One of you run down to the station
and ask the inspector to come.

35
00:04:45,536 --> 00:04:46,829
Tell him it's serious.

36
00:04:49,331 --> 00:04:50,916
Is this woman a lodger of yours?

37
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,460
No, but Miss Baring is.

38
00:04:53,544 --> 00:04:56,630
And she had Mrs. Druce
to supper with her tonight.

39
00:04:56,714 --> 00:04:58,424
As a matter of fact, it was about...

40
00:04:58,507 --> 00:05:03,762
Well, you see, Mr. Constable,
both these ladies are... I mean, were...

41
00:05:03,846 --> 00:05:06,974
We're all members of the company playing
at the Theatre Royale this week.

42
00:05:07,057 --> 00:05:10,477
And as I was leaving the theater...
You see, I'm the stage manager,

43
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:12,563
and Mr. Druce here,
he's the general manager.

44
00:05:12,646 --> 00:05:15,482
You see, when I left the theater tonight,
I was invited to join them.

45
00:05:15,566 --> 00:05:18,694
Wait. Wait a minute, wait a minute.
One at a time, please.

46
00:05:18,777 --> 00:05:21,196
Oh, they've killed you, Edna.
They've killed you.

47
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:24,116
Tell me, darling. Who done it?

48
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,200
Did she do it?

49
00:05:30,622 --> 00:05:32,374
You always hated Edna.

50
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,461
Thought yourself too good for us...

51
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:40,341
with your high-and-mighty ladylike ways.

52
00:05:40,424 --> 00:05:42,301
Now, sir, pull yourself together.

53
00:05:44,386 --> 00:05:46,305
Oh, leave me alone.

54
00:05:48,807 --> 00:05:50,726
Is there any brandy in the house?

55
00:05:52,102 --> 00:05:54,938
You'll find some brandy
in the flask on the table.

56
00:05:56,565 --> 00:05:58,567
I was just giving some to Edna, when...

57
00:05:59,735 --> 00:06:01,445
when...

58
00:06:01,528 --> 00:06:03,447
I can't think.

59
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,823
I can't remember.

60
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:12,664
Why, there's none there. It's empty.

61
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:15,084
I'll run back and fetch some.

62
00:06:15,959 --> 00:06:17,878
Perhaps you'd like a cup of tea, dear.

63
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,171
It'll warm you up.

64
00:06:20,297 --> 00:06:22,049
I'll go and make it.

65
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,512
I'll give you a hand, dear.

66
00:06:32,059 --> 00:06:33,727
Oh, shall I light this gas, dear?

67
00:06:33,811 --> 00:06:35,938
Please, dear. It's still hot.

68
00:06:36,021 --> 00:06:38,232
It only wants a drop more in it.

69
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,234
Light the stove, will you, dear?

70
00:06:42,277 --> 00:06:43,987
I, uh...

71
00:06:45,406 --> 00:06:48,117
I suppose Mrs. Druce really is dead.

72
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,660
You know, uh...

73
00:06:51,495 --> 00:06:54,957
You know, Diana never did get on well
with poor Edna Druce,

74
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:58,961
and I know they hadn't been on speaking
terms for the last seven weeks.

75
00:07:00,295 --> 00:07:02,840
Miss Diana said nothing to me about it.

76
00:07:02,923 --> 00:07:05,634
Well, it's a fact.
You can take it from me.

77
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,437
I don't believe she could have done it,

78
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:19,898
though there's no denying
she is headstrong.

79
00:07:19,982 --> 00:07:21,650
I should say so.

80
00:07:21,733 --> 00:07:24,319
Why, she gave in her notice
the other day over Edna.

81
00:07:24,403 --> 00:07:26,655
Who? Miss Diana?

82
00:07:26,738 --> 00:07:30,534
Yes, but, uh,
Druce didn't want to lose her,

83
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:34,079
so Edna would've
been glad enough to see her go.

84
00:07:34,163 --> 00:07:35,289
Then suddenly...

85
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:41,462
Suddenly, last night, she changed,
asked if they couldn't make it up.

86
00:07:41,962 --> 00:07:45,174
Diana was puzzled,
but asked her home to supper.

87
00:07:45,257 --> 00:07:47,259
I can't help feeling now that

88
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:50,471
she had some reason
for getting Diana here alone.

89
00:07:50,554 --> 00:07:54,558
Of course, perhaps,
she being hot stuff like she is,

90
00:07:54,641 --> 00:07:57,269
she thought one of her men
was getting too keen on Diana Baring

91
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:59,438
and wanted her out of the way.

92
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,484
What kind of tea did you use, dear?

93
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:08,155
Oh, my dear, I've tried so many kinds,
I don't really remember which this is.

94
00:08:08,238 --> 00:08:11,116
I think it will be all right.
Do you mind, uh...

95
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:13,660
- Open the door?
- Yes, if you don't mind.

96
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:22,169
Here. I say, I've just made tea.

97
00:08:22,252 --> 00:08:25,255
That's all right, Ma.
We'll give her some down at the station.

98
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:31,488
Third act beginners, please.

99
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,908
Your call, Miss Baring.

100
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,925
That's Miss Baring's understudy.

101
00:09:52,009 --> 00:09:54,219
There you are, see? Going on now.

102
00:09:54,303 --> 00:09:55,846
Do you mind answering the door?

103
00:09:55,929 --> 00:09:58,724
Answer the door? Of course he will.

104
00:09:58,807 --> 00:10:00,934
Well, I don't know where we shall go.

105
00:10:01,393 --> 00:10:03,645
Oh, Tom. Tom. Just a minute.

106
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,814
The inspector would like
to have a word with you.

107
00:10:05,897 --> 00:10:07,774
This is Mr. Tom Druid, Inspector.

108
00:10:07,858 --> 00:10:10,569
How do you do, sir?
It's about the murder, Mr. Druid.

109
00:10:10,652 --> 00:10:12,863
Now, there are one or two points
we are clearing up.

110
00:10:12,946 --> 00:10:16,366
I suppose you didn't happen to see
Mrs. Druce and Miss Baring

111
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:18,827
leave the theater together last night?

112
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,626
Yes, I did.

113
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:29,838
As a matter of fact, I remarked to Fane,
our leading man, about it.

114
00:10:30,672 --> 00:10:33,717
- He saw them as well, you know.
- Why? Is it very unusual?

115
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:36,219
Unusual? I should say so.

116
00:10:36,303 --> 00:10:39,056
Unusual? It's an absolute miracle.

117
00:10:39,139 --> 00:10:41,308
As I was saying to my wife,

118
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:44,102
I said, "Annie, we m..."

119
00:10:44,186 --> 00:10:46,229
Hold on, old boy. My cue.

120
00:11:04,831 --> 00:11:06,667
Say, which of the two women is this?

121
00:11:07,292 --> 00:11:08,502
Mrs. Druid?

122
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:14,383
No, I'm afraid you're unlucky this time,
Inspector.

123
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:17,844
This is Handell Fane, 100% he-woman.

124
00:11:18,637 --> 00:11:20,514
Mr. Fane's our leading man.

125
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:23,350
I assure you, Inspector,
I'm not the other woman in the case.

126
00:11:23,433 --> 00:11:24,643
I know that, Mr. Fane,

127
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:28,021
but I understand you saw
the two women together last night.

128
00:11:28,105 --> 00:11:30,148
Yes, just before I left the theater.

129
00:11:30,232 --> 00:11:32,109
Then I went straight to my room.

130
00:11:32,401 --> 00:11:33,735
Alone?

131
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:37,030
Yes. No. Stewart came with me.

132
00:11:37,114 --> 00:11:39,116
He came and wanted to
borrow some cigarettes.

133
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:41,993
He'd lost his case or something.

134
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:44,496
And after, I went straight to bed.

135
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,581
Say, excuse me. I'm on.

136
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:49,626
Reginald, darling, has that cat gone yet?

137
00:11:52,295 --> 00:11:54,381
Oh, it's you, Constable, is it?

138
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,759
Don't you dare to try to run away from me.

139
00:11:57,843 --> 00:11:59,803
Come here when I speak to you.

140
00:12:01,638 --> 00:12:03,265
No, no, you don't.

141
00:12:03,348 --> 00:12:06,518
That's the... bathroom.

142
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:08,478
Come here.

143
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:11,982
Are you afraid of a poor, weak woman?

144
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,775
He promised to meet here.

145
00:12:17,946 --> 00:12:20,574
Say, who's that man?

146
00:12:20,657 --> 00:12:24,453
Oh, that's our heavy lead, Ian Stewart.
Very sound actor.

147
00:12:24,536 --> 00:12:25,537
Is he married?

148
00:12:26,705 --> 00:12:29,458
- How did he get on with the prisoner?
- Excuse me, Inspector.

149
00:12:39,551 --> 00:12:42,304
Say, how did he get on
with the prisoner, Miss Baring?

150
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,681
Oh, so-so, you know.

151
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:46,975
Was he popular with the ladies?

152
00:12:47,058 --> 00:12:48,810
Are you talking about Stewart?

153
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,313
He's a bit too popular, if you ask me.

154
00:12:51,396 --> 00:12:53,565
At least, if you could call her a lady.

155
00:12:53,899 --> 00:12:56,193
Now, Doucie.
Remember, she's only just dead.

156
00:12:56,276 --> 00:12:57,944
Oh, all right, all right.

157
00:12:58,028 --> 00:13:01,114
I've never heard yet
that telling the truth was a disgrace.

158
00:13:01,198 --> 00:13:03,700
And everyone knew about Edna
and Stewart anyhow.

159
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:07,037
And do I take it Mr. Stewart
and Mrs. Druce...

160
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:08,747
Excuse me. My line.

161
00:13:09,831 --> 00:13:13,752
Oh! Don't bother to show me through.
I know my way.

162
00:13:14,336 --> 00:13:16,713
This is not the first time, Reginald.

163
00:13:16,922 --> 00:13:18,107
Everything's going splendid...

164
00:13:18,131 --> 00:13:21,718
Well, perhaps I ought not to say
"Edna and Stewart" like that.

165
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:23,553
But, Ted, you know what Edna was.

166
00:13:23,637 --> 00:13:26,056
Anyone she liked the look of
had to be roped in.

167
00:13:26,139 --> 00:13:28,016
I can't wait any longer. Quick.

168
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:29,518
Quick! In here!

169
00:13:32,646 --> 00:13:35,065
Excuse me a minute.
Shan't be long. It's their change.

170
00:13:35,899 --> 00:13:38,193
How do you do?
No, I'm sorry. He's not here.

171
00:13:38,276 --> 00:13:40,529
- What have they done with her?
- Who? Miss Baring?

172
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:43,114
Why, she's down at the station, I expect.

173
00:13:43,198 --> 00:13:44,908
Did she say anything, do you know?

174
00:13:44,991 --> 00:13:46,743
Is there anything one can do?

175
00:13:46,827 --> 00:13:49,538
Markham, you don't
really think she's done it, do you?

176
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,957
Why have they arrested her?

177
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,667
I saw it with me own eyes.

178
00:13:53,959 --> 00:13:56,837
She was with the poker in her hand,
or just by her side, anyway.

179
00:13:57,254 --> 00:13:59,798
- Blood. Covered with blood.
- Oh, don't.

180
00:13:59,881 --> 00:14:01,132
What's the matter with you?

181
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,928
Blood always makes me feel sick.
Even the mention of it.

182
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:07,097
Well, that's all right.
Here's your helmet.

183
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:20,819
- Here. Hurry up, Markham.
- There you are.

184
00:14:22,404 --> 00:14:23,864
Okay. On you go.

185
00:14:59,107 --> 00:15:01,026
Members of the jury,

186
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:04,195
Diana Baring is indicted
and stands charged

187
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,990
with the willful murder of Edna Druce.

188
00:15:07,073 --> 00:15:10,493
To this indictment,
she has pleaded not guilty.

189
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:14,706
It is your duty to inquire
whether she is guilty or not.

190
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,169
I need not remind you

191
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:24,341
that in the eyes of the law,
men and women are equal.

192
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:29,220
The crime of murder, in England, at least,

193
00:15:29,304 --> 00:15:32,307
is judged dispassionately.

194
00:15:32,390 --> 00:15:35,685
Neither beauty, nor youth,

195
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:38,396
nor provocation can mitigate...

196
00:15:39,397 --> 00:15:42,192
She gave me the strangest look:

197
00:15:42,275 --> 00:15:45,320
half surprised and half angry.

198
00:15:46,321 --> 00:15:49,324
And she said, "How dare you?"

199
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:53,161
And I don't remember any more.

200
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,915
I-I just don't remember.

201
00:16:01,962 --> 00:16:07,092
Whatever I did must've happened
when I was not conscious of myself.

202
00:16:09,260 --> 00:16:11,221
That's all I can say.

203
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,685
Our defense is a complete denial
of all responsibility.

204
00:16:17,352 --> 00:16:21,064
You've been able to observe the behavior
of the prisoner in the dock

205
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,525
and in the witness box.

206
00:16:23,608 --> 00:16:27,821
My learned friend has referred
to her behavior as "hardened."

207
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,367
Gentlemen and ladies of the jury,
is there anything so hardy

208
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:35,161
as the behavior of sheer innocence?

209
00:16:37,706 --> 00:16:40,417
If you're convinced
that the story of the defense

210
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,585
represents the facts of the case,

211
00:16:42,669 --> 00:16:46,089
it is your duty to discharge the accused.

212
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:50,677
I should like to remind you
that truth is often stranger than fiction.

213
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,680
If on the other hand,
you are convinced that the evidence

214
00:16:53,763 --> 00:16:56,266
is indeed fiction,

215
00:16:56,349 --> 00:17:00,812
then I must tell you in the words
of the counsel of the prosecution

216
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:05,025
that "neither youth, nor beauty,
nor provocation

217
00:17:05,108 --> 00:17:08,486
can be held to mitigate
the crime of murder."

218
00:17:09,446 --> 00:17:13,158
Go and consider the facts for yourselves.

219
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,429
Well, uh, ladies and gentlemen,
we can't talk standing.

220
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,348
Would you ladies like to sit together?

221
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:59,788
Oh, I say, may we smoke?

222
00:18:01,456 --> 00:18:03,166
Yes. I don't see why not.

223
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:06,544
Uh, that is,
if the ladies haven't any objection.

224
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:08,588
No. Not at all.

225
00:18:10,423 --> 00:18:13,718
Now, I think the best thing to do,
if you agree,

226
00:18:13,802 --> 00:18:17,430
is to allow me to go over
the broad facts of the case.

227
00:18:17,514 --> 00:18:20,141
Because after all,
I think it's pretty clear,

228
00:18:20,225 --> 00:18:22,769
and I really don't think
it'll be necessary for us to examine

229
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:24,729
all the evidence again in detail.

230
00:18:26,689 --> 00:18:30,026
Now, in the first place, the prosecution.

231
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:34,531
They say that the girl and the dead woman

232
00:18:34,614 --> 00:18:36,324
were on bad terms.

233
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,577
They make it up.

234
00:18:39,661 --> 00:18:41,246
Edna Druce comes to supper.

235
00:18:42,789 --> 00:18:47,085
They both have a drop too much
and begin quarreling about some man.

236
00:18:47,710 --> 00:18:49,629
For instance,
you heard how the landlady said

237
00:18:49,712 --> 00:18:51,631
that she heard raised voices.

238
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:54,926
And the girl admits as much,
but won't give the name of the man.

239
00:18:55,009 --> 00:18:56,344
Now, that in itself is fishy.

240
00:18:58,388 --> 00:19:02,142
The girl gets hold of the poker,
loses her temper,

241
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:05,019
and there's an end of Edna Druce.

242
00:19:06,479 --> 00:19:09,482
The prosecution argues that it has proofs.

243
00:19:11,192 --> 00:19:13,153
Practically caught red-handed.

244
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:17,657
Girl's dress... all over blood,
the poker at her feet,

245
00:19:18,449 --> 00:19:21,327
brandy flask empty,
and the girl half-silly.

246
00:19:22,871 --> 00:19:24,914
And in addition to that,

247
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:27,917
no other person was known
to have entered the house.

248
00:19:28,001 --> 00:19:30,003
I think that's pretty clear.

249
00:19:30,712 --> 00:19:33,798
I think you ought to mention that the girl
comes of a good family.

250
00:19:34,716 --> 00:19:38,970
Yes, but it's those so-called
"well-bred people"

251
00:19:39,053 --> 00:19:42,473
who are able to remain so brazen
in the face of a thing like this.

252
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:44,726
Look at the way she behaved in the box.

253
00:19:44,809 --> 00:19:46,311
Half a minute, ladies.

254
00:19:47,395 --> 00:19:48,438
Let's get on.

255
00:19:49,397 --> 00:19:50,982
Now take the defense.

256
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:54,194
They don't deny she did it,

257
00:19:54,277 --> 00:19:56,779
but argue that their case is

258
00:19:56,863 --> 00:20:01,201
that the thing happened when, uh,
she was in a fit or something.

259
00:20:01,910 --> 00:20:05,580
Surely it is clear to you
that in the evidence for the defense,

260
00:20:05,914 --> 00:20:08,166
the doctor put forward a theory

261
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:11,044
that it was due
to the independent activity

262
00:20:11,127 --> 00:20:13,087
of the suppressed experience.

263
00:20:13,171 --> 00:20:15,882
In other words, disassociation,

264
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,760
which in this particular form
is called a fugue.

265
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:21,554
So that a person displaying
the strangest behavior

266
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:25,225
for a considerable period of time
would be quite unaware of this

267
00:20:25,308 --> 00:20:27,602
when he or she regained normality.

268
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,314
I think the best thing for us all to do

269
00:20:31,397 --> 00:20:33,733
is to write down our opinions
on a piece of paper,

270
00:20:34,484 --> 00:20:36,945
and then we can see how we stand.

271
00:20:38,863 --> 00:20:40,907
Whichever are in the minority...

272
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:46,955
can then give their individual reasons,

273
00:20:47,038 --> 00:20:49,791
and the thing can be worked out that way.

274
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:26,202
That makes seven "guilty"
and three "not guilty."

275
00:21:27,578 --> 00:21:28,913
There are two not in.

276
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:33,418
I take it you haven't come
to any decision at all.

277
00:21:35,295 --> 00:21:37,171
I think the whole business is hateful.

278
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,675
There's too much responsibility
put on our shoulders.

279
00:21:40,758 --> 00:21:42,885
Either we've got to let her go free...

280
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,847
That's not fair to the rest of the world
if she's guilty...

281
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:48,599
Or we got to hang her,
and that's barbarous.

282
00:21:48,683 --> 00:21:50,643
But if we recommend her to mercy...

283
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:53,229
Mercy? Is that what you call it?

284
00:21:53,313 --> 00:21:55,189
Twenty years cut out of life...

285
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,400
The best years...
And to spend them in hell.

286
00:21:58,109 --> 00:22:00,278
Have you ever been inside a prison?

287
00:22:00,361 --> 00:22:03,948
It takes a civilized community to
think out a punishment like that.

288
00:22:04,032 --> 00:22:05,491
I think you exaggerate.

289
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:08,870
It's no use confusing the issue like this.

290
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,665
People who do wrong
have got to be punished somehow.

291
00:22:13,916 --> 00:22:15,793
You can't run the world on sentiment.

292
00:22:15,877 --> 00:22:19,505
No, but that's what we've tried to do.
Save the unfit.

293
00:22:19,589 --> 00:22:23,551
Get more children
and make glorious wars to be rid of.

294
00:22:23,634 --> 00:22:26,054
The whole world's
a reeking pit of sentiment.

295
00:22:28,681 --> 00:22:31,017
Your verdict, Mr. Shackleton.

296
00:22:38,358 --> 00:22:39,984
Guilty, I suppose.

297
00:22:42,403 --> 00:22:44,072
Who's the other one?

298
00:22:50,828 --> 00:22:53,581
You, Mr. Matthews?

299
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,001
Is there anything special troubling you
so that you can't make a decision?

300
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,545
No, no.

301
00:22:59,629 --> 00:23:03,257
Well, what is it prevents you
making a decision?

302
00:23:03,341 --> 00:23:06,010
Well, nothing, really.

303
00:23:07,595 --> 00:23:10,598
Well, have you made up your mind at all
what it's going to be?

304
00:23:11,682 --> 00:23:13,059
Uh, no.

305
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,853
You heard the case for the prosecution.

306
00:23:15,937 --> 00:23:19,065
- That's pretty clear, isn't it?
- Oh, yes.

307
00:23:19,148 --> 00:23:21,109
And you know what the defense is,
don't you?

308
00:23:21,567 --> 00:23:25,405
Yes. But I don't quite understand

309
00:23:25,488 --> 00:23:29,992
what the lady meant when...
When she said no.

310
00:23:30,243 --> 00:23:32,495
When-When she spoke.

311
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,126
My dear man,
Mrs. Ward was only trying to tell you

312
00:23:38,209 --> 00:23:41,838
that the defense was
that murder was committed

313
00:23:41,921 --> 00:23:44,674
in a fit of daytime sleepwalking.

314
00:23:47,718 --> 00:23:52,223
Yes.
But, the murder took place at nighttime.

315
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,394
Can you write?

316
00:23:56,477 --> 00:23:59,522
- Uh, yes.
- Well, will you please write down

317
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,365
whether you think
the prisoner guilty or not?

318
00:24:29,802 --> 00:24:32,680
Now, that leaves only three
for "not guilty."

319
00:24:32,763 --> 00:24:36,726
I'll give you my reasons for "not guilty."

320
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:41,105
The evidence for the defense by the doctor
is to my mind conclusive.

321
00:24:41,856 --> 00:24:45,318
Anyone who's followed the modern trend
of psychological investigations

322
00:24:45,401 --> 00:24:47,570
must be aware that any person

323
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:51,157
suffering from severe mental strain,
such as the prisoner may have been,

324
00:24:51,240 --> 00:24:53,618
following on
so many rehearsals and things,

325
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,037
may bring about a certain condition

326
00:24:56,120 --> 00:24:59,832
in which the patient
is no longer either conscious of

327
00:24:59,916 --> 00:25:02,710
or responsible for their actions.

328
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:04,295
We've already had evidence

329
00:25:04,378 --> 00:25:06,923
that the prisoner's mind
is a delicately balanced one

330
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:12,803
and quite liable through
some hidden flaw in that mind

331
00:25:12,887 --> 00:25:15,723
to become deprived of all consciousness

332
00:25:15,806 --> 00:25:20,645
and readily enter into a state
wherein the body is still functioning,

333
00:25:20,728 --> 00:25:23,397
though no longer
under the control of the will.

334
00:25:24,732 --> 00:25:27,652
And it is on these grounds that I feel

335
00:25:27,735 --> 00:25:30,905
that Diana Baring must have been
the victim of circumstances.

336
00:25:30,988 --> 00:25:33,574
I have no doubt that Mrs. Ward is right.

337
00:25:33,658 --> 00:25:37,078
That being the case,
it is quite liable to recur,

338
00:25:37,161 --> 00:25:39,247
possibly with the same result.

339
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:41,666
Well, that's a point I hadn't considered.

340
00:25:42,708 --> 00:25:44,544
Well, it's really important.

341
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:47,171
Because with this poor girl,
you have to consider

342
00:25:47,255 --> 00:25:49,423
not only this one tragedy

343
00:25:49,507 --> 00:25:51,300
but others that may follow it.

344
00:25:51,384 --> 00:25:54,053
There may be other crimes
lying latent in her.

345
00:25:54,136 --> 00:25:57,932
You mean there's a sort of
dual personality in her?

346
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:02,520
One of these persons is violent and cruel,
and the other, just an ordinary woman.

347
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:06,566
Of course.
If we set this bad personality free,

348
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:10,653
we must be prepared
to shoulder the responsibility.

349
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,697
Yes.

350
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:15,157
If we let her go,
and anything should happen...

351
00:26:15,241 --> 00:26:18,244
The blood would be on our hands.

352
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:21,038
Do you wish to alter your verdict,
Mrs. Ward?

353
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:39,140
Now, Mr. Daniels, after all you've heard,
does your opinion still remain the same?

354
00:26:41,851 --> 00:26:44,312
Well, you know,
I find it very difficult to believe

355
00:26:44,395 --> 00:26:46,606
that a girl of that sort
should do such a thing.

356
00:26:47,857 --> 00:26:52,194
After all, she looks
a perfectly ripping girl, you know.

357
00:26:54,697 --> 00:26:56,073
Well, you know what I mean?

358
00:26:56,157 --> 00:26:59,076
A sort of girl that one would like
for a daughter.

359
00:27:00,036 --> 00:27:04,540
I presume, sir, that an ugly woman would
stand very little chance at your hand.

360
00:27:04,624 --> 00:27:07,084
The thing you've got to decide,
Mr. Daniels, has nothing to do

361
00:27:07,168 --> 00:27:10,254
with the qualities of the young lady
as they appeal to you.

362
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:12,715
Yes, of course. I know that.

363
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:14,675
But... dash it all.

364
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:17,595
Well, you know what I mean. It's...

365
00:27:17,678 --> 00:27:19,972
It's pretty awful
and all that sort of thing.

366
00:27:20,056 --> 00:27:22,850
Setting aside the things
you're thinking of,

367
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,143
what's your verdict?

368
00:27:26,687 --> 00:27:27,938
Well...

369
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,276
Well...

370
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,945
Oh, guilty, I suppose.

371
00:27:42,620 --> 00:27:44,580
And now we're practically complete.

372
00:27:44,664 --> 00:27:46,123
There's just Sir John.

373
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:52,588
Well, don't dismiss me as easily as that,
Mr. Foreman.

374
00:27:52,672 --> 00:27:54,298
Yes, we mustn't be long.

375
00:27:54,382 --> 00:27:56,342
Time is money, you know.

376
00:27:56,425 --> 00:28:00,388
Time in this case,
may I remind you, is life.

377
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:03,808
If I'm delaying you all, I apologize.

378
00:28:03,891 --> 00:28:06,102
I admit that I am not...

379
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:08,396
a man of business.

380
00:28:08,479 --> 00:28:11,190
I'm a poor actor.

381
00:28:11,273 --> 00:28:14,235
Oh, come now, dear Sir John.

382
00:28:15,528 --> 00:28:18,656
I repeat, the poorest of poor players.

383
00:28:19,865 --> 00:28:22,368
And my time on the stage
would be shortened,

384
00:28:22,451 --> 00:28:26,622
had I not for years trained myself to,

385
00:28:26,706 --> 00:28:27,707
how shall I put it?

386
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:34,171
To apply the technique of life
to the problems of my art.

387
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:38,551
But today, ladies and gentlemen,
that process is reversed.

388
00:28:39,468 --> 00:28:42,805
I find myself applying
the technique of my art...

389
00:28:43,889 --> 00:28:46,058
to a problem of real life.

390
00:28:47,810 --> 00:28:50,229
And my art is not satisfied.

391
00:28:55,443 --> 00:28:56,902
In the first place,

392
00:28:57,570 --> 00:29:00,823
I am fairly convinced
that Diana Baring was telling the truth

393
00:29:00,906 --> 00:29:02,825
when she said she remembered nothing.

394
00:29:05,536 --> 00:29:08,414
In fact,
I've been impressed by her behavior

395
00:29:09,165 --> 00:29:10,624
all through the trial.

396
00:29:10,708 --> 00:29:13,878
- But, my dear sir!
- Oh, I say, Sir John.

397
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:16,172
Oh, please don't think
I'm taking the same line

398
00:29:16,255 --> 00:29:18,632
as our friend Mr. Daniels here.

399
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:22,011
He made a very gallant attempt.

400
00:29:22,094 --> 00:29:24,513
But I assure you
my reasoning goes a little deeper.

401
00:29:25,306 --> 00:29:28,058
I am convinced further
that she was again telling the truth

402
00:29:28,809 --> 00:29:30,352
when she said she had drunk no brandy.

403
00:29:31,312 --> 00:29:33,606
But you've forgotten the evidence
of the police sergeant.

404
00:29:33,689 --> 00:29:37,359
He said she smelled of drink
and appeared dazed on arrest.

405
00:29:37,443 --> 00:29:40,154
How do you know that was not the wine
she had at dinner?

406
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:42,865
What about the evidence of Markham,
the stage manager?

407
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:46,410
He found the empty
brandy flask right on the spot.

408
00:29:46,494 --> 00:29:47,620
Yes, but...

409
00:29:47,703 --> 00:29:50,289
What about the evidence of the actor,
Stewart?

410
00:29:50,372 --> 00:29:53,125
He said the women
had been enemies for some time.

411
00:29:54,251 --> 00:29:57,087
Ah, he was the one who said
the prisoner was rough

412
00:29:57,171 --> 00:29:59,173
to Mrs. Druce on the stage once.

413
00:29:59,256 --> 00:30:02,551
All pointing to her violent nature,
Sir John.

414
00:30:02,635 --> 00:30:06,096
Yes, but that was not altogether
borne out by Fane.

415
00:30:06,180 --> 00:30:09,600
You know, the, um...
the female impersonator man.

416
00:30:09,683 --> 00:30:11,685
But his evidence was of little use.

417
00:30:11,769 --> 00:30:13,569
He was so obviously
in love with the prisoner.

418
00:30:16,273 --> 00:30:19,235
In any case, everything was perfectly
clear when the body was discovered.

419
00:30:21,237 --> 00:30:24,240
Why, the woman was actually caught
in the room red-handed.

420
00:30:24,323 --> 00:30:26,116
And found with a poker by her side.

421
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:27,743
And her dress all over blood.

422
00:30:27,827 --> 00:30:29,328
And quarreling over a man.

423
00:30:30,538 --> 00:30:31,914
That's right.

424
00:30:31,997 --> 00:30:33,916
Any answer to that, Sir John?

425
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:37,294
Think of her personality.

426
00:30:37,378 --> 00:30:39,255
She's not the kind of girl to get drunk.

427
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:40,923
Brandy in the flask was there.

428
00:30:41,006 --> 00:30:43,801
- She doesn't deny it.
- That's right.

429
00:30:43,884 --> 00:30:45,511
Any answer to that, Sir John?

430
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:48,013
Not at the moment.

431
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:52,828
Then there is the question of whether
anyone else entered the house that night.

432
00:30:52,852 --> 00:30:55,229
- Landlady says not.
- Girl says not.

433
00:30:55,312 --> 00:30:57,648
- They were alone.
- That's right.

434
00:30:57,731 --> 00:30:59,608
Any answer to that, Sir John?

435
00:31:00,818 --> 00:31:03,445
Not at the moment.

436
00:31:03,529 --> 00:31:07,867
But have we taken it too much for granted
that no one else could've done the murder?

437
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:10,035
- Says they were alone.
- Says they quarreled.

438
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:12,121
- Admits it.
- That's right.

439
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,248
Any answer to that, Sir John?

440
00:31:16,333 --> 00:31:18,544
She does not admit it.

441
00:31:18,627 --> 00:31:20,254
She says she doesn't remember.

442
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:23,340
Is that a guilty woman's answer?

443
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,552
- Red-handed.
- Poker by her side.

444
00:31:26,635 --> 00:31:29,030
- And her dress all over blood.
- Stand out against all of us.

445
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,389
Make an exhibition of yourself.

446
00:31:30,472 --> 00:31:32,016
- Waste of time.
- Waste of money.

447
00:31:32,099 --> 00:31:33,434
- Quarreling.
- Brandy.

448
00:31:33,517 --> 00:31:36,437
- Hands all over blood.
- Any answer? Any answer?

449
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,105
Any answer to that, Sir John?

450
00:32:04,924 --> 00:32:07,134
Well, now that we're all agreed
on our verdict,

451
00:32:07,217 --> 00:32:09,303
I can inform the judge that we're ready.

452
00:33:19,832 --> 00:33:22,167
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

453
00:33:22,251 --> 00:33:24,670
have you agreed upon your verdict,

454
00:33:24,753 --> 00:33:28,966
and do you find the prisoner guilty
or not guilty?

455
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:31,218
Guilty.

456
00:33:31,301 --> 00:33:34,888
Diana Baring, have you anything to say

457
00:33:34,972 --> 00:33:38,142
why sentence of death
should not be passed upon you

458
00:33:38,225 --> 00:33:39,643
according to law?

459
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:43,689
It's absurd, I tell you.
It's absolutely absurd.

460
00:33:45,149 --> 00:33:48,861
Oyez, oyez, oyez.

461
00:33:48,944 --> 00:33:53,365
Pray, silence, all of you,
under pain of imprisonment

462
00:33:53,449 --> 00:33:57,745
while sentence of death is passed
upon the prisoner at the bar.

463
00:34:39,495 --> 00:34:41,497
<i>So the conference
adjourned until tomorrow.</i>

464
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:46,335
<i>The Baring murder trial
came to a conclusion today</i>

465
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,378
<i>with a verdict of guilty,</i>

466
00:34:48,462 --> 00:34:51,507
<i>and a sentence of death
was passed on Diana Baring.</i>

467
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,677
<i>And that is all the news.
But here is an SOS</i>

468
00:34:55,761 --> 00:34:58,847
<i>which has just been
brought into the studio.</i>

469
00:34:58,931 --> 00:35:03,227
<i>We've been asked by the commissioner
of police to broadcast the following...</i>

470
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:06,438
The, uh, brandy cocktail you ordered,
Sir John.

471
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,649
Right.

472
00:35:08,732 --> 00:35:11,110
Ring up Mr. Bennett, will you,

473
00:35:11,193 --> 00:35:13,737
and ask him to bring me round
details of the takings

474
00:35:14,196 --> 00:35:15,823
for the last three nights.

475
00:35:15,906 --> 00:35:18,075
Also to find out what the bookings are.

476
00:35:18,158 --> 00:35:20,828
- Very good, Sir John.
<i>- ...kindly communicate at once</i>

477
00:35:20,911 --> 00:35:24,665
<i>with New Scotland Yard,
telephone Victoria 7000,</i>

478
00:35:24,748 --> 00:35:26,834
<i>or with any police station.</i>

479
00:35:30,045 --> 00:35:31,797
<i>This is the national program.</i>

480
00:35:32,798 --> 00:35:38,095
<i>Our concert tonight is an orchestral one,
given by the Radio Symphony Orchestra.</i>

481
00:35:39,221 --> 00:35:45,102
<i>They start by playing the overture
to</i> Tristan und Isolde <i>by Wagner.</i>

482
00:35:48,814 --> 00:35:50,816
<i>Funny, that SOS coming
on top of that other.</i>

483
00:35:52,526 --> 00:35:54,236
<i>"Save her soul."</i>

484
00:35:55,445 --> 00:35:56,738
<i>Save her.</i>

485
00:35:58,323 --> 00:36:00,951
<i>If I'd stood up longer,
I might've worn them down.</i>

486
00:36:02,911 --> 00:36:05,164
<i>Why couldn't they see the girl as I did...</i>

487
00:36:06,373 --> 00:36:08,667
<i>the rest of the fellows on the jury?</i>

488
00:36:10,919 --> 00:36:13,505
<i>But anyone standing in the dark
on a charge like that...</i>

489
00:36:14,631 --> 00:36:17,718
<i>probably looks different
from the same person somewhere else.</i>

490
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:21,638
<i>Ah, amusing,
the way she stood up to everybody.</i>

491
00:36:23,015 --> 00:36:25,809
<i>There's no doubt that's the thing
that did her a lot of harm.</i>

492
00:36:27,477 --> 00:36:29,730
<i>Yet it was that manner of hers that...</i>

493
00:36:31,690 --> 00:36:33,400
<i>very attractive, I thought.</i>

494
00:36:35,319 --> 00:36:37,696
<i>And I wonder what her feelings are now.</i>

495
00:36:50,584 --> 00:36:51,919
<i>Who drank that brandy?</i>

496
00:36:52,628 --> 00:36:56,215
<i>Why didn't I force that point
home to them?</i>

497
00:36:56,298 --> 00:36:58,842
<i>Easy to figure these things out
afterwards.</i>

498
00:37:01,178 --> 00:37:02,804
<i>The girl says she didn't drink it...</i>

499
00:37:04,473 --> 00:37:06,725
<i>yet she admits
she might have killed Edna Druce.</i>

500
00:37:08,435 --> 00:37:10,395
<i>That's queer.</i>

501
00:37:10,479 --> 00:37:12,689
<i>Why admit a big thing like that
and yet be so sure</i>

502
00:37:12,773 --> 00:37:16,568
<i>she didn't do a small thing,
such as drink a drop of brandy?</i>

503
00:37:18,654 --> 00:37:20,739
<i>All that, treated lightly today.</i>

504
00:37:23,116 --> 00:37:26,870
<i>I'm sure I was right when I raised that
point, and I feel more certain now.</i>

505
00:37:26,954 --> 00:37:29,498
<i>How did we know that someone else
didn't drink the brandy?</i>

506
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,875
<i>Perhaps there was someone else.
That's the whole thing.</i>

507
00:37:32,209 --> 00:37:33,877
<i>Whoever drank that brandy!</i>

508
00:37:36,255 --> 00:37:38,757
Mr. Bennett has come up to see you,
Sir John.

509
00:37:58,026 --> 00:38:00,904
- Hello, Bennett.
- Glad you're back, Sir John.

510
00:38:00,988 --> 00:38:04,658
Been reading about it all.
Plenty of publicity.

511
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:07,869
Must've been awful for you,
though, you having met the lady before.

512
00:38:07,953 --> 00:38:10,914
Well, she wanted to become a star.

513
00:38:10,998 --> 00:38:12,666
A year ago, that was.

514
00:38:12,749 --> 00:38:15,210
I suppose you can say
in a sense that she has.

515
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:18,714
- A star in a murder...
- Bennett, please.

516
00:38:21,133 --> 00:38:23,719
Look here. Get hold of my understudy.

517
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,680
Tell him he'll have to
go on again tonight.

518
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,308
Pray though that I get to return
to the role.

519
00:38:29,391 --> 00:38:32,269
Oh, and, um,
get on the telephone straightaway

520
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:35,939
to my lawyer, Mr. Rice Sr.

521
00:38:36,023 --> 00:38:41,361
Oh, I can give it to you.
Temple Bar... 5993.

522
00:38:41,528 --> 00:38:42,863
Yes, sir.

523
00:38:57,002 --> 00:38:58,503
I want you as well to get hold...

524
00:38:59,546 --> 00:39:02,424
of as many as you can
of the members of that company...

525
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:05,218
You know, the touring company
concerned with the murder.

526
00:39:05,594 --> 00:39:07,721
In particular, the...

527
00:39:07,804 --> 00:39:09,639
funny little man, the stage manager.

528
00:39:10,766 --> 00:39:12,726
I forget his name.

529
00:39:12,809 --> 00:39:16,730
I'll see him at the office in the morning.

530
00:39:16,813 --> 00:39:19,608
TEMPLE BAR 5, double 9, 3.

531
00:39:19,691 --> 00:39:23,612
But I thought the trial was over,
Sir John.

532
00:39:23,695 --> 00:39:25,947
No, my dear, Bennett,
the trial is not over,

533
00:39:26,031 --> 00:39:28,033
by a hell of a long way.

534
00:39:28,116 --> 00:39:30,285
Well, is it a stunt, then, Sir John?

535
00:39:30,369 --> 00:39:34,373
A stunt? This is a lying man's stunt.

536
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,500
Oh, they're engaged, sir.

537
00:39:36,583 --> 00:39:38,877
Oh, very well.
I'll try myself later. Don't wait.

538
00:39:48,261 --> 00:39:50,222
No, don't worry, don't worry.

539
00:40:04,694 --> 00:40:07,197
Diana Baring...

540
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:09,991
Why did I send her away?

541
00:40:10,492 --> 00:40:13,912
Told her it'd be good for her
to gain experience in the provinces.

542
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,330
"Good for her."

543
00:40:17,958 --> 00:40:19,835
And now she's come back.

544
00:41:33,158 --> 00:41:35,952
Eh, I think, uh,

545
00:41:36,036 --> 00:41:38,788
boiling it all down, dear,
I think perhaps we'd better, uh,

546
00:41:38,872 --> 00:41:41,458
accept Sir John's offer after all,
don't you?

547
00:41:45,086 --> 00:41:48,131
Oh, yes. Either that one
or one of the other two.

548
00:41:48,215 --> 00:41:50,342
It's all the same to me.

549
00:41:53,094 --> 00:41:55,722
That'll be Sir John himself.
I don't think.

550
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,685
Oh, well.

551
00:42:00,769 --> 00:42:03,063
Seems she won't let us
stay on here any longer.

552
00:42:03,146 --> 00:42:05,524
That means Lucy will have to go back
to her aunt's...

553
00:42:05,607 --> 00:42:06,691
Oh, I mean...

554
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:10,403
Sophie will have to go back
to her Aunt Lucy.

555
00:42:10,487 --> 00:42:14,115
I don't want to go to Aunt Lucy.
I want to come on tour with you.

556
00:42:14,783 --> 00:42:17,035
I can't let you go back to Sir John's!
Here's a letter!

557
00:42:17,118 --> 00:42:19,746
I really thought you were kidding me!
I really did!

558
00:42:19,829 --> 00:42:20,956
What's this?

559
00:42:25,085 --> 00:42:26,461
From Sir John himself.

560
00:42:27,587 --> 00:42:31,424
He'd be happy if we could be
at his office at 12:00.

561
00:42:31,508 --> 00:42:34,386
- Can we really do it in time?
- I think we can if we try.

562
00:42:34,469 --> 00:42:35,470
Bye, everyone.

563
00:42:38,598 --> 00:42:41,726
Can you let me have the loan
of a rub of benzene?

564
00:42:41,810 --> 00:42:42,894
Dear, I don't think...

565
00:42:44,354 --> 00:42:47,482
Petrol will get the shine
out of this suit.

566
00:42:47,566 --> 00:42:50,819
There's a job for you!
Look sharp about it!

567
00:42:50,902 --> 00:42:52,529
Have you got a nice, clean hankie?

568
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,155
Here, I think so, somewhere.

569
00:42:54,239 --> 00:42:55,532
- Ted?
- Yes, dear?

570
00:42:55,615 --> 00:42:57,325
What you done with me nail polish?

571
00:42:57,409 --> 00:42:59,452
I haven't seen it. Here.

572
00:43:00,328 --> 00:43:02,163
I hope this...

573
00:43:02,247 --> 00:43:03,915
hope this smell of petrol goes off.

574
00:43:03,999 --> 00:43:06,167
Oh, well, you can blame it onto the car.

575
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,253
I think we shall just about do it.

576
00:43:10,171 --> 00:43:11,756
I say, my dear, you owe me.

577
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,634
That's all right, missus. I promise
your bill shall be paid the first.

578
00:43:14,718 --> 00:43:17,387
I'm not referring to bills.
It's two seats I'm after.

579
00:43:17,470 --> 00:43:20,223
- Two seats for the first night!
- We'll give 'em to you.

580
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:33,320
How do you do, Mr. Markham?

581
00:43:33,403 --> 00:43:35,280
Nicely, thanks, Sir John.

582
00:43:40,869 --> 00:43:43,413
Oh. How do you do, Sir John?

583
00:43:43,496 --> 00:43:45,457
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

584
00:43:57,594 --> 00:44:00,680
You know, it seems to me, Mr. Markham...

585
00:44:02,015 --> 00:44:06,394
that we artists have a double function.

586
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:08,563
We use life to create art,

587
00:44:08,647 --> 00:44:10,774
and we use art to...

588
00:44:10,857 --> 00:44:11,900
How shall I put it?

589
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,111
To criticize life.

590
00:44:15,195 --> 00:44:17,447
- You agree?
- Oh, certainly, Sir John.

591
00:44:20,825 --> 00:44:22,535
Yes, I knew you would.

592
00:44:22,619 --> 00:44:24,871
Now, Mr. Markham,

593
00:44:24,954 --> 00:44:26,956
between artists...

594
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:29,084
do we always fulfill our double function?

595
00:44:29,834 --> 00:44:32,921
Are we not so much
occupied in using life to create art

596
00:44:33,004 --> 00:44:34,881
that we forget our other function?

597
00:44:37,967 --> 00:44:40,679
I foresee your objection.
You're going to say,

598
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:44,182
"What opportunities does the round
of daily life offer?"

599
00:44:44,265 --> 00:44:50,063
I wonder... If you ever saw
a problem play I once did...

600
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,232
<i>- Pistols for Two?</i>
- Oh, yes.

601
00:44:52,315 --> 00:44:53,441
- You did?
- Yes.

602
00:44:53,525 --> 00:44:56,069
What the critics describe
as a highbrow shocker.

603
00:44:57,153 --> 00:44:59,072
Now,

604
00:44:59,155 --> 00:45:02,117
when a highbrow shocker
occurs in real life,

605
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:05,662
does the public call in the actor?

606
00:45:05,745 --> 00:45:07,330
No.

607
00:45:07,414 --> 00:45:09,708
Mr. Markham, I read your thoughts.

608
00:45:15,380 --> 00:45:17,882
You know, you're saying to yourself,

609
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:20,260
"This man is, um, talking to his hat."

610
00:45:20,552 --> 00:45:22,429
- Oh, no...
- Oh, of course you are.

611
00:45:23,513 --> 00:45:26,307
Otherwise, you wouldn't be
the practical man I take you for.

612
00:45:27,016 --> 00:45:30,395
You're also wondering to yourself
why on earth I've brought you here.

613
00:45:31,229 --> 00:45:32,772
Well...

614
00:45:32,856 --> 00:45:34,482
That brings me at last...

615
00:45:36,651 --> 00:45:37,777
to my object.

616
00:45:38,570 --> 00:45:41,322
Now, yesterday and the day before...

617
00:45:42,657 --> 00:45:44,826
I was on the jury at the Baring trial.

618
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:49,164
You impressed me
both as an artist and as a man.

619
00:45:50,206 --> 00:45:51,958
By the way you gave your evidence.

620
00:45:53,543 --> 00:45:56,713
Now, I want from you,
if I'm not being too indiscreet...

621
00:45:56,796 --> 00:45:59,758
- Oh, no.
- ...the inner history of that case.

622
00:46:04,471 --> 00:46:05,972
What is it that...

623
00:46:07,515 --> 00:46:08,933
See, now, of course...

624
00:46:10,101 --> 00:46:13,104
Bennett talked over with you
the question of that engagement?

625
00:46:14,355 --> 00:46:16,024
- Well, sir...
- You see, we'd rather...

626
00:46:16,775 --> 00:46:19,486
rather hoped that you'd be free to take on
the stage management

627
00:46:19,569 --> 00:46:22,197
when I send off this tour
at Christmas of the...

628
00:46:22,280 --> 00:46:23,364
<i>The Green Eye.</i>

629
00:46:24,741 --> 00:46:28,328
I also thought of working out
some arrangement of a yearly basis,

630
00:46:28,411 --> 00:46:31,539
but we can easily talk that over later
with Bennett, can't we?

631
00:46:31,623 --> 00:46:34,626
Oh, thank you very much indeed,
Sir John. I...

632
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:38,588
Well, I am free at the moment.

633
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:42,133
And I've had a lot of experience I'm sure
will come in very handy.

634
00:46:42,217 --> 00:46:44,886
Oh, that's... Then that's settled, huh?

635
00:46:44,969 --> 00:46:45,970
Uh, yes.

636
00:46:47,764 --> 00:46:49,766
What? What is it, Mr. Markham?

637
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:52,602
Well, it's my wife, Sir John.

638
00:46:52,685 --> 00:46:56,689
You see, we've always been joint,
as you may say, and...

639
00:46:58,149 --> 00:47:00,860
Well, would it be asking too much,
Sir John, if...

640
00:47:01,027 --> 00:47:02,779
if a part, I mean, any part that you...

641
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:05,406
I see. Mrs. Markham acts.

642
00:47:05,907 --> 00:47:07,408
Acts, Sir John?

643
00:47:08,451 --> 00:47:11,037
Well, perhaps it's not
for me to say, but...

644
00:47:12,539 --> 00:47:15,959
But my Doucie... Well,
you may say I'm prejudiced, Sir John,

645
00:47:16,042 --> 00:47:18,253
but I've been stage manager
now for ten years,

646
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,547
and it is a fact that a wife,
even a good one,

647
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:22,799
is not always the right thing
to have in a company,

648
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:24,592
if you understand what I'm getting at.

649
00:47:24,676 --> 00:47:27,262
But my Doucie, my wife,

650
00:47:27,345 --> 00:47:30,348
well, professionally,
she's been my right hand.

651
00:47:30,431 --> 00:47:33,977
And there's no one she can't play
at 24 hours' notice or less,

652
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:37,230
from a Gladys Cooper
to a Marie Lloyd part.

653
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:42,277
- I beg your pardon.
- No, no, no. Go on, do.

654
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:44,863
I was going to say she has
her off days, of course.

655
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:46,573
Well, who hasn't?

656
00:47:46,656 --> 00:47:50,201
Yes. I mean, only last summer
I had to speak to her seriously about it.

657
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:53,246
She'd had a quick change-over
from a barmaid

658
00:47:53,329 --> 00:47:55,707
to a Salvation Army lass.

659
00:47:55,790 --> 00:47:59,460
And it told on her.
There's no doubt about it. It told on her.

660
00:47:59,544 --> 00:48:01,754
After about a week,
I said to her straight out,

661
00:48:01,838 --> 00:48:04,757
"Now look here, my dear, this can't go on.

662
00:48:04,841 --> 00:48:06,593
If you can't pull yourself together,

663
00:48:06,676 --> 00:48:08,469
we shall have to go into Shakespeare."

664
00:48:10,597 --> 00:48:14,434
Well, she didn't say much.
Not more than was reasonable.

665
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:17,937
But she thought it over,
and for the rest of that tour,

666
00:48:18,021 --> 00:48:21,357
I'll give you my word,
Sir John, she was Tallulah.

667
00:48:21,441 --> 00:48:24,027
Pure Tallulah.

668
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:27,030
- Where is Mrs. Markham now?
- She's downstairs waiting in the...

669
00:48:27,697 --> 00:48:31,075
One minute then.
Let's... send for her to come up.

670
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:37,040
Is that you, Bennett?

671
00:48:37,123 --> 00:48:39,584
Oh, no, no. I'm sorry. No.

672
00:48:43,129 --> 00:48:46,883
Oh, Bennett,
Mrs. Markham is somewhere downstairs.

673
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,676
Would you have her sent up, please?

674
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,679
Yes. Yes, of course. Up to my room.

675
00:48:56,559 --> 00:49:00,104
Now, Mr. Markham, about this trial.

676
00:49:00,688 --> 00:49:04,233
I confess to feeling very uneasy about it.

677
00:49:04,776 --> 00:49:07,487
You see, I played a part in the thing,
the part of a juryman.

678
00:49:08,613 --> 00:49:12,408
And it was not until the curtain was
rung down on the death sentence

679
00:49:12,492 --> 00:49:13,993
that I said to myself...

680
00:49:15,328 --> 00:49:18,247
"This is not a play, this is life."

681
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,961
Life can be less kind
than your dramatists, Mr. Markham.

682
00:49:23,711 --> 00:49:28,508
Life permits a beautiful
and unfortunate girl to go to the gallows.

683
00:49:28,591 --> 00:49:30,468
Unless...

684
00:49:30,551 --> 00:49:33,805
art, for once,
can bring its technique to bear.

685
00:49:34,347 --> 00:49:36,391
Good Lord,
do you mean to say you think she's...

686
00:49:36,474 --> 00:49:38,226
Innocent, my dear Markham, yes.

687
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,319
It was assumed she was guilty
because she didn't deny it.

688
00:49:48,403 --> 00:49:51,155
- Yes, but I saw the...
- What did you see?

689
00:49:51,239 --> 00:49:53,366
Diana Baring sitting beside the dead body.

690
00:49:53,449 --> 00:49:55,910
She was dazed, you say.
What was the cause?

691
00:49:55,994 --> 00:49:59,247
Drink? She hardly ever touched anything.

692
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,333
Then who did? Think it over, Mr. Markham.

693
00:50:02,417 --> 00:50:04,252
Then there was the pain in her head.

694
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,170
Was she examined by a doctor?

695
00:50:06,254 --> 00:50:11,050
Might he not have found
traces of a blow if he'd examined her?

696
00:50:11,134 --> 00:50:13,886
But, no, he didn't.
He assumed, like everyone else,

697
00:50:13,970 --> 00:50:16,180
that she was guilty
because she didn't deny it.

698
00:50:16,848 --> 00:50:20,518
And there was no further investigation,
no inquiry.

699
00:50:22,645 --> 00:50:24,313
Think it over, Mr. Markham.

700
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:31,988
You know,
I feel the most terrible responsibility.

701
00:50:32,321 --> 00:50:35,783
I was one of the 12 people
who decided the fate of this poor girl.

702
00:50:36,993 --> 00:50:39,579
I'd found myself caught up

703
00:50:39,662 --> 00:50:41,873
with the machine
that makes these things...

704
00:50:46,586 --> 00:50:49,464
Ah, Mrs. Markham, so good of you to come
with your husband this morning.

705
00:50:49,547 --> 00:50:52,633
Oh, I was quite glad.
Glad of a breath of fresh air.

706
00:50:56,054 --> 00:50:59,307
What a charming place
you have up here, Sir John.

707
00:50:59,390 --> 00:51:02,518
And Piccadilly,
with all the shops so near.

708
00:51:11,152 --> 00:51:13,863
You'll... You'll stay to lunch, of course.

709
00:51:15,364 --> 00:51:18,951
I find it difficult sometimes to wait
to a reasonable hour for my luncheon.

710
00:51:19,035 --> 00:51:21,537
Yes, I must say
I feel the same way myself.

711
00:51:21,621 --> 00:51:24,290
It's very rare that I can do
without my little

712
00:51:24,373 --> 00:51:26,584
tidbits in the morning, about 11:00.

713
00:51:27,293 --> 00:51:29,712
Oh, Javier, a cocktail at once, please,
and serve lunch.

714
00:51:29,796 --> 00:51:32,673
He's engaged us, Doucie.

715
00:51:32,757 --> 00:51:34,175
- Joint.
- No!

716
00:51:35,093 --> 00:51:37,386
Yes.
I find Mr. Markham is free to join me.

717
00:51:37,470 --> 00:51:40,014
So... please.

718
00:51:40,098 --> 00:51:42,266
So I thought he could...

719
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:44,727
Oh, we can settle all that later,
can't we?

720
00:51:44,811 --> 00:51:45,812
Yes, please.

721
00:51:48,022 --> 00:51:49,315
Thank you.

722
00:51:50,566 --> 00:51:51,776
Thank you.

723
00:51:54,654 --> 00:51:56,405
Oh, one moment, please.

724
00:52:09,127 --> 00:52:12,421
In the meantime,
success to our researches.

725
00:52:16,050 --> 00:52:18,761
Your husband and I
have been discussing the Baring case,

726
00:52:19,053 --> 00:52:22,807
and we feel that if the murder
were approached from another angle...

727
00:52:24,725 --> 00:52:25,726
Oh, sorry.

728
00:52:26,811 --> 00:52:30,189
We shall be able to arrive
at a different result.

729
00:52:30,273 --> 00:52:32,233
What?

730
00:52:32,316 --> 00:52:34,569
What, and get Diana off, you mean?

731
00:52:34,652 --> 00:52:36,654
But she can't get away from that poker.

732
00:52:51,627 --> 00:52:55,882
Then you don't share our convictions
that Miss Baring is not guilty?

733
00:52:59,343 --> 00:53:01,387
Well... Well, I mean to say,

734
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:03,723
Diana Baring was such a nice girl.

735
00:53:03,806 --> 00:53:06,976
I never thought for one moment
she could've done a thing like that.

736
00:53:07,977 --> 00:53:10,521
Didn't I always say, Ted,
that anybody who knew her

737
00:53:10,605 --> 00:53:12,565
never could've thought it for one moment?

738
00:53:12,815 --> 00:53:14,984
Oh, Sir John, have you found anything out?

739
00:53:15,818 --> 00:53:17,528
Are you going to take it up yourself?

740
00:53:17,612 --> 00:53:19,780
Oh, we would be so glad to help,
wouldn't we, Ted?

741
00:53:24,535 --> 00:53:25,578
Shall we...

742
00:53:31,292 --> 00:53:33,836
I really don't know where to begin
this thing, do you, Markham?

743
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,087
Over there.

744
00:53:36,255 --> 00:53:38,674
Well, uh... Well, yes, Sir John, I...

745
00:53:38,758 --> 00:53:40,426
Oh, I see. Uh...

746
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:45,431
- Yes. I should say I knew where to begin.
- Thank you.

747
00:53:57,360 --> 00:53:58,361
Oh, can I help?

748
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,783
Sir John didn't know where to begin, Ted.

749
00:54:03,866 --> 00:54:07,119
No, no. Let's, um...
Let's hear it, Mrs. Markham.

750
00:54:07,203 --> 00:54:09,247
I'm completely in the dark.

751
00:54:09,330 --> 00:54:11,930
If your husband could show the way,
I shall be more than grateful.

752
00:54:15,503 --> 00:54:17,838
Go on. What is it, Markham?

753
00:54:17,922 --> 00:54:20,800
Well, Sir John,
I should say the best place would be

754
00:54:20,883 --> 00:54:23,386
back at the town
where the murder was committed.

755
00:54:26,931 --> 00:54:28,975
Yes.

756
00:54:29,058 --> 00:54:32,728
Do you think you could, um,
spare me a day or two of your time?

757
00:54:32,812 --> 00:54:34,730
Yes, of course we could, sir.

758
00:54:34,814 --> 00:54:37,942
If I might suggest it,
we could go over the ground.

759
00:54:38,025 --> 00:54:40,653
You could show me one or two places
connected with the murder.

760
00:54:40,736 --> 00:54:43,990
But, uh, do you mean it might have been
someone else altogether,

761
00:54:44,073 --> 00:54:45,783
what killed Edna Druce?

762
00:54:45,866 --> 00:54:48,411
Well, I don't know.
It might've been somebody from outside.

763
00:54:48,494 --> 00:54:50,705
How do you make that out?

764
00:54:50,788 --> 00:54:52,832
Well, I don't know.

765
00:54:52,915 --> 00:54:54,875
Miss Mitcham didn't do it.

766
00:54:54,959 --> 00:54:57,169
And Miss Diana didn't.

767
00:54:57,253 --> 00:54:59,338
So it must've been somebody from outside.

768
00:54:59,422 --> 00:55:01,173
If it was, they'd have to get in,

769
00:55:01,257 --> 00:55:02,925
and they'd have to get out again.

770
00:55:03,009 --> 00:55:05,720
That's clever.

771
00:55:05,803 --> 00:55:08,139
Well, what I mean to say is that

772
00:55:08,222 --> 00:55:09,890
the first thing we've got to do is to

773
00:55:10,641 --> 00:55:14,061
find out who saw somebody,
apart from Druce,

774
00:55:14,145 --> 00:55:16,897
anywhere near there
at half past 1:00 that morning.

775
00:55:16,981 --> 00:55:18,858
Well, Ted, for a start, there's that chap

776
00:55:18,941 --> 00:55:21,319
we thought was a policeman
coming round the corner.

777
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:22,403
Oh, that was nothing.

778
00:55:23,529 --> 00:55:25,239
Just a minute.

779
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:28,826
I shall like to hear
something about this policeman.

780
00:55:28,909 --> 00:55:31,120
Well, you see, Sir John,

781
00:55:31,203 --> 00:55:32,204
it was like this.

782
00:55:33,706 --> 00:55:36,917
On the night of the murder,
when the knocking woke us up,

783
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:40,713
I was over by the window
slipping on my negligee,

784
00:55:40,796 --> 00:55:43,924
and I popped me head out the window
to see who was making all that noise.

785
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:46,510
And I saw the policeman
coming round the corner,

786
00:55:46,594 --> 00:55:48,971
so I said to Ted, I said,

787
00:55:49,055 --> 00:55:51,015
"Hello, it's the police."

788
00:55:51,098 --> 00:55:53,309
And then I took my eyes off him

789
00:55:53,392 --> 00:55:54,852
to tell Ted here...

790
00:55:55,936 --> 00:55:59,440
and when I looked again,
there was no one in sight.

791
00:56:00,441 --> 00:56:03,736
And then Ted said,
"Yes, you're right. Here he comes."

792
00:56:03,819 --> 00:56:05,112
And when I looked again,

793
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:08,074
it was a different policeman altogether.

794
00:56:09,909 --> 00:56:13,537
- What had become of the first one?
- I've no idea, sir.

795
00:56:14,163 --> 00:56:16,457
He must have turned the corner
and come back.

796
00:56:16,540 --> 00:56:18,000
Is that the corner down there?

797
00:56:20,086 --> 00:56:21,295
Yes, that's it, sir.

798
00:56:22,004 --> 00:56:23,714
You're sure it wasn't the same man?

799
00:56:23,798 --> 00:56:27,343
Well, it couldn't have been. We only took
our eyes off him about two seconds.

800
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:30,346
Oh, blast.

801
00:56:30,429 --> 00:56:33,057
Uh, is any more here, do you think, sir?

802
00:56:33,641 --> 00:56:34,642
I shouldn't think so.

803
00:56:49,657 --> 00:56:51,075
My God, that's Druce.

804
00:56:51,409 --> 00:56:52,701
He must be crazy.

805
00:56:53,828 --> 00:56:55,496
Here, we better get down.

806
00:56:57,790 --> 00:56:59,959
You are not going in my house tonight.

807
00:57:07,716 --> 00:57:10,386
Take him away, please.

808
00:57:10,469 --> 00:57:13,764
He's done this before.
The police have promised to stop him.

809
00:57:13,848 --> 00:57:15,492
Yes, that's all right.
Now come along, Druce.

810
00:57:15,516 --> 00:57:16,701
- My wife's here.
- Take him away.

811
00:57:16,725 --> 00:57:19,270
Yes, I know, but you're much better
off at home. Come on.

812
00:57:19,353 --> 00:57:22,064
She will not see you. Please go away.

813
00:57:22,148 --> 00:57:24,442
Come on. Come on, now.

814
00:57:25,609 --> 00:57:27,194
The street up in arms.

815
00:57:33,742 --> 00:57:36,829
Oh, this is terrible for me,
this business is.

816
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,665
I shall have to move. I'm sure I shall.

817
00:57:39,748 --> 00:57:42,418
Yes, well, uh, Miss Mitcham,

818
00:57:42,501 --> 00:57:45,421
we'd like to show this gentleman around.

819
00:57:45,504 --> 00:57:47,006
That is, if you don't mind.

820
00:57:47,506 --> 00:57:48,507
May I?

821
00:57:49,175 --> 00:57:51,302
Oh. Yes, sir. Of course.

822
00:57:51,385 --> 00:57:53,345
Yes, certainly. Will you come in?

823
00:58:08,402 --> 00:58:10,613
Well, Sir John,

824
00:58:10,696 --> 00:58:12,490
that's where they found the body,

825
00:58:12,573 --> 00:58:14,408
right in front of the hearth there.

826
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,745
And, uh,

827
00:58:17,828 --> 00:58:20,080
Miss Baring was sitting just about there.

828
00:58:20,539 --> 00:58:22,958
Oh, by the way,
did you ever get your poker back, miss...

829
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:25,461
Oh, I can't bear to talk about it,

830
00:58:25,544 --> 00:58:28,422
especially with poor Miss Baring
being where she is.

831
00:58:28,506 --> 00:58:32,885
Why, you might as well
convict "Cleopatria."

832
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:42,311
Do you think anybody could've got in
from the back of the house?

833
00:58:48,776 --> 00:58:51,862
You see, just beyond the backyard,
there's an alleyway,

834
00:58:51,946 --> 00:58:54,532
and just beyond there,
there's the theater.

835
00:58:54,615 --> 00:58:57,368
Look, sir.
The dressing rooms are at the back.

836
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,831
Yes, it'd take quite an athlete
to get in that way.

837
00:59:02,915 --> 00:59:05,292
I don't see how anyone could get in here

838
00:59:05,376 --> 00:59:07,795
with this <i>aspidistra</i>
filling up the window.

839
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:11,006
Anyway, without upsetting it. And look
at the size of it.

840
00:59:12,466 --> 00:59:13,592
Yes. It's a fine plant.

841
00:59:15,094 --> 00:59:17,680
Unless, of course,
it was somebody who knew the room.

842
00:59:17,763 --> 00:59:20,182
But Miss Baring did not have any visitors.

843
00:59:20,266 --> 00:59:21,976
Only Mrs. Markham now and again,

844
00:59:22,059 --> 00:59:24,645
and Mr. Fane and Mr. Stewart to tea,

845
00:59:24,728 --> 00:59:26,897
and Mr... What's his name?

846
00:59:26,981 --> 00:59:29,149
The little man with the squeaky voice.

847
00:59:29,233 --> 00:59:31,819
- Oh, Tom Druid.
- Yes. Yes, that's him.

848
00:59:41,495 --> 00:59:43,038
"Squeaky voice." That reminds me.

849
00:59:45,291 --> 00:59:46,834
In your evidence, Miss Mitcham,

850
00:59:47,543 --> 00:59:50,004
you said you heard angry women's voices.

851
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,673
- Yes, sir, I did.
- Would you swear to that?

852
00:59:52,756 --> 00:59:55,801
Oh, yes, sir.
You can't mistake a woman's voice.

853
01:00:05,644 --> 01:00:07,730
You know, I had known a contralto...

854
01:00:07,813 --> 01:00:10,524
Oh, yes, but this was high, quite high.

855
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:12,526
Miss Mitcham! Miss Mitcham!

856
01:00:12,610 --> 01:00:14,945
Oh, my God, Miss Mitcham. Where are you?

857
01:00:15,029 --> 01:00:17,489
The kitchen chimney's afire, Miss Mitcham!

858
01:00:17,573 --> 01:00:19,408
That's Alice.

859
01:00:19,491 --> 01:00:20,909
One moment, Miss Mitcham.

860
01:00:20,993 --> 01:00:23,329
Excuse me, sir. I can't stop just now.

861
01:00:23,412 --> 01:00:25,914
That Alice of mine has set
the kitchen chimney afire.

862
01:00:25,998 --> 01:00:28,417
- Didn't you hear her calling?
- No, no, no. That was me.

863
01:00:29,001 --> 01:00:32,004
Or is it "I"?
Do you know, Markham? I never know.

864
01:00:32,087 --> 01:00:33,505
Oh, no.

865
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,968
I'm ashamed to say
I played a trick on you, Miss Mitcham.

866
01:00:38,052 --> 01:00:41,305
Now,
the high voice you heard that night...

867
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:45,142
may not have been a woman's.

868
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,393
You've just admitted it.

869
01:00:47,311 --> 01:00:50,022
No. I have not admitted anything.

870
01:00:50,356 --> 01:00:52,733
And I don't hold to playing such tricks.

871
01:00:52,816 --> 01:00:55,194
And I'd like to ask you, sir,
what you mean by it.

872
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,113
Brought me out all of a tremble.

873
01:00:58,197 --> 01:01:00,908
And you, too, Mr. Markham,
standing there, grinning.

874
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:07,456
You realize that your evidence
as it stands may hang Miss Baring?

875
01:01:08,248 --> 01:01:10,751
Now, I'm not blaming you.
Not blaming you, Miss Mitcham.

876
01:01:11,585 --> 01:01:14,963
But you swore that you heard
women's voices quarreling.

877
01:01:15,756 --> 01:01:18,634
And I have to prove to them
that it might have been a man's voice,

878
01:01:18,717 --> 01:01:20,552
especially a high-pitched man's voice...

879
01:01:21,887 --> 01:01:23,180
just like Mr. Druid's.

880
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:26,350
Oh! I'd do anything for Miss Baring.

881
01:01:26,433 --> 01:01:28,394
Oh, can't something be done now?

882
01:01:28,477 --> 01:01:30,646
Yes, yes.
Now, you're going to help us further.

883
01:01:30,729 --> 01:01:33,857
First of all,
could you show us some more of the house?

884
01:01:33,941 --> 01:01:35,609
Miss Baring's bedroom, for example?

885
01:01:35,943 --> 01:01:38,904
Yes. Certainly, sir. This way, please.

886
01:01:42,074 --> 01:01:44,284
I don't think you'll find
much in here, sir.

887
01:01:44,535 --> 01:01:47,287
There's a few of her things
over there on the windowsill.

888
01:01:47,371 --> 01:01:51,583
I didn't like to send them to...
where she is now, sir.

889
01:01:51,667 --> 01:01:53,335
Oh, I think she'd like them.

890
01:01:53,419 --> 01:01:55,421
Well, let me have them,
and I'll send them on.

891
01:02:05,139 --> 01:02:07,099
Why, it's one of you, sir.

892
01:02:20,404 --> 01:02:22,281
Lot more places to go to, Sir John.

893
01:02:35,252 --> 01:02:37,629
Thank you.

894
01:02:37,713 --> 01:02:39,047
Thank you very much indeed.

895
01:02:39,465 --> 01:02:41,675
Thank you for doing this.

896
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:45,053
Yes. Lot more places, Sir John.
There's the Stage Door.

897
01:02:45,137 --> 01:02:47,473
And then we'll go round
to Stewart's lodgings.

898
01:02:47,556 --> 01:02:50,350
Then we might go to the police station,
chat with the inspector.

899
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:52,436
He knows me. And then, um...

900
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,689
Then we can go across
to the Red Lion, have a sandwich,

901
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:58,192
while we're talking to the proprietor.

902
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:02,070
And then... Oh! And then if Stevens,
the policeman, is still on his beat...

903
01:03:02,780 --> 01:03:06,200
Yes, I think that's about all we can do.

904
01:03:06,283 --> 01:03:08,911
Oh, yes. We'll find out something
if it takes us all night.

905
01:03:09,536 --> 01:03:13,499
I thought perhaps, um, a little dinner.

906
01:03:13,582 --> 01:03:15,292
Oh. Oh, that's all right, Sir John.

907
01:03:15,375 --> 01:03:17,127
Don't you worry about Doucie and me.

908
01:03:17,711 --> 01:03:19,314
We've had to go without before,
haven't we, dear?

909
01:03:19,338 --> 01:03:20,839
Oh, I should say.

910
01:03:20,923 --> 01:03:23,300
Well, shall we begin, Sir John? This way.

911
01:03:40,484 --> 01:03:43,421
Evening, mate. I've called to see if
any of my people left anything behind.

912
01:03:43,445 --> 01:03:46,031
No, nothing,
except that there broken basin

913
01:03:46,114 --> 01:03:47,616
in number four dressing room.

914
01:03:47,699 --> 01:03:49,499
That was some of your chaps
up to their larks.

915
01:03:49,576 --> 01:03:51,286
And never paid for it neither.

916
01:03:52,079 --> 01:03:53,705
Whose room was that?

917
01:03:53,789 --> 01:03:56,083
Uh, Fane's and Stewart's, I believe, sir.

918
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:58,043
No, none of our people broke that, mate.

919
01:03:58,126 --> 01:03:59,586
Oh, there is something for you.

920
01:04:00,462 --> 01:04:02,673
This cigarette case
left behind in number four.

921
01:04:02,756 --> 01:04:04,132
You'll know who it belonged to.

922
01:04:04,216 --> 01:04:07,177
Oh, righto. When I find out whose it is,
I'll forward it.

923
01:04:07,261 --> 01:04:10,305
Can we see that dressing room?

924
01:04:10,389 --> 01:04:13,141
Uh, I'd like to see that broken basin.

925
01:04:13,225 --> 01:04:14,643
I'll take you 'long.

926
01:04:40,168 --> 01:04:42,045
Where does that window look out to?

927
01:04:42,129 --> 01:04:44,006
The private houses round the corner.

928
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:48,343
I wish I knew who broke that basin.

929
01:04:54,141 --> 01:04:57,060
Uh, lot more places to go to, Sir John.

930
01:05:11,241 --> 01:05:12,910
Here we go, sir.

931
01:05:16,163 --> 01:05:18,290
- Thank you so much.
- Good day.

932
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,877
- Did you find anything?
- No, nothing much.

933
01:05:22,878 --> 01:05:24,129
Oh, honestly...

934
01:05:38,685 --> 01:05:41,188
Well, here we are, Sir John.

935
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:42,981
And, uh, I hope you sleep well.

936
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:47,194
I expect you'll find
she's left something cold out for you.

937
01:05:47,277 --> 01:05:49,237
I'll be along first thing in the morning.

938
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,702
I shan't be sorry to... get to bed myself.

939
01:05:57,913 --> 01:06:00,707
I must say, this street
gives me the creeps.

940
01:06:00,791 --> 01:06:03,543
Well, good night, Sir John.
Come along, dear.

941
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:04,670
Good night.

942
01:06:11,969 --> 01:06:13,595
I say, Markham.

943
01:06:18,934 --> 01:06:20,227
Markham...

944
01:06:21,603 --> 01:06:22,938
you don't think that I'd better

945
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,857
eat at the Red Lion after all, do you?

946
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:31,321
Well, that's, uh,
just as you like, of course, Sir John,

947
01:06:31,405 --> 01:06:34,533
but, uh, I thought you wanted to sleep
at the policeman's house,

948
01:06:34,616 --> 01:06:36,493
so as to be able to find out something.

949
01:06:36,576 --> 01:06:38,256
I mean,
that's why I made the arrangements.

950
01:06:39,871 --> 01:06:43,959
I mean, considering we haven't found out
very much today, I think that...

951
01:06:44,209 --> 01:06:46,920
it'd be better if you did, sir.

952
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,256
Perhaps you're right.

953
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,193
- Good night, Mrs. Markham.
- Oh, good night, Sir John.

954
01:06:52,217 --> 01:06:54,302
- Good night, Markham.
- Good night, sir.

955
01:07:38,138 --> 01:07:40,265
You cry, they'll start crying too.

956
01:07:40,348 --> 01:07:42,350
Take it, sir. They'll never know, sir.

957
01:07:44,144 --> 01:07:48,482
Will you have the tray on the bed, sir
or shall I pull over the chair?

958
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,442
Leave them things be!

959
01:07:51,651 --> 01:07:54,029
Oh, please don't trouble.
Just put the tray down somewhere.

960
01:07:54,112 --> 01:07:56,698
I'll, uh...
I'll see to it. I'll dress first.

961
01:07:57,240 --> 01:07:59,242
Oh, don't say that, sir.

962
01:07:59,326 --> 01:08:01,369
I know what you gents like.

963
01:08:01,453 --> 01:08:04,247
"A nice cup of tea and
a kipper before I get up,

964
01:08:04,331 --> 01:08:05,916
- and I'm a new man."
- Hmm.

965
01:08:05,999 --> 01:08:08,418
That's what my last lodger used to say.

966
01:08:11,379 --> 01:08:13,548
Stop climbing on that rail, Teddy!

967
01:08:14,299 --> 01:08:15,801
Them children!

968
01:08:15,884 --> 01:08:17,761
They follow me about.

969
01:08:17,844 --> 01:08:20,013
"Ma" this and "Ma" that.

970
01:08:20,097 --> 01:08:24,351
On my word, I don't have a moment's peace
from morning to night.

971
01:08:24,434 --> 01:08:26,103
What have you two been doing?

972
01:08:26,520 --> 01:08:27,938
That's quite all right, really.

973
01:08:28,021 --> 01:08:31,024
- He's got my Bootsy!
- Well, I never did.

974
01:08:31,108 --> 01:08:32,859
Wait till I get you downstairs.

975
01:08:37,823 --> 01:08:40,450
Take this kitten down,
and don't you bring it up here again.

976
01:08:40,534 --> 01:08:43,995
Now, please... if you could put
the tray on the table

977
01:08:44,079 --> 01:08:46,414
and send me up some hot water at once,
I'll get up.

978
01:08:46,498 --> 01:08:47,999
Just as you like, sir, but...

979
01:08:50,085 --> 01:08:53,505
Go downstairs and put on a couple
of saucepans. Go on.

980
01:08:53,588 --> 01:08:56,383
Now, why can't you leave him be?

981
01:08:56,466 --> 01:08:59,553
Time and time again I've told you not to
mess with the lodgers' luggage.

982
01:08:59,636 --> 01:09:03,098
I'll have your father take you to the
police station if you can't stop touching.

983
01:09:04,558 --> 01:09:06,518
- They do keep on touching!
- Mm.

984
01:09:06,601 --> 01:09:07,978
Some lodgers don't like it.

985
01:09:08,061 --> 01:09:10,730
For instance, I had a couple of 'em here
a little while back,

986
01:09:10,814 --> 01:09:13,150
and one of 'em give him
a good slap for doing that.

987
01:09:13,692 --> 01:09:15,944
You know the Baring case?
Well, they was in it.

988
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:19,447
As a matter of fact,
it was my husband what found the body.

989
01:09:19,531 --> 01:09:21,783
Did him a lot of good, the Baring case.

990
01:09:24,077 --> 01:09:27,247
Oh, well, I never!

991
01:09:28,165 --> 01:09:30,292
She's taken a fancy to you.

992
01:09:30,375 --> 01:09:32,210
There ain't many she takes to.

993
01:09:32,878 --> 01:09:34,880
You got some of your own, I suppose.

994
01:09:35,088 --> 01:09:36,840
Yes. Oh, yes.

995
01:09:36,923 --> 01:09:39,801
You were saying...
about Arthur and the luggage.

996
01:09:40,343 --> 01:09:43,180
Oh, yes. Well, Arthur was messing about

997
01:09:43,263 --> 01:09:45,700
with one of them's luggage
when he come across what he thought

998
01:09:45,724 --> 01:09:47,767
was his father's helmet and uniform.

999
01:09:47,851 --> 01:09:50,645
Afterwards, I went up...
Mr. Fane, it was... and I said,

1000
01:09:50,729 --> 01:09:53,023
"I don't like the idea
of your hitting my Arthur.

1001
01:09:53,106 --> 01:09:55,817
Just because he found
a stage uniform in your bag,

1002
01:09:55,901 --> 01:09:58,111
he only thought it was his father's,"
I said.

1003
01:09:58,195 --> 01:10:01,990
I felt a bit of a fool when I finished,
because he simply turned round,

1004
01:10:02,073 --> 01:10:04,451
and he said he didn't know
what I was talking about.

1005
01:10:04,534 --> 01:10:06,429
"Well," I said,
"If it wasn't you, it must have been

1006
01:10:06,453 --> 01:10:08,914
the other one who was lodging with you,
Mr. Stewart."

1007
01:10:08,997 --> 01:10:11,041
I meant to speak to
Mr. Stewart afterwards,

1008
01:10:11,124 --> 01:10:13,668
but in the excitement of the murder,
I forgot all about it.

1009
01:10:18,006 --> 01:10:19,633
Come in, my dear Markham.

1010
01:10:22,302 --> 01:10:24,763
I'd like to see you for a minute.

1011
01:10:24,846 --> 01:10:27,766
I'll send the hot water up, sir.
Come along, now.

1012
01:10:27,849 --> 01:10:30,518
Don't encourage her too much, sir.
That's right. Run along down.

1013
01:10:30,602 --> 01:10:33,063
Here, Arthur. Just come on, come on.

1014
01:10:33,146 --> 01:10:34,606
Now go in the street and play.

1015
01:10:34,689 --> 01:10:36,650
Don't you get run over. Go on.

1016
01:10:36,733 --> 01:10:37,984
That's right, go on.

1017
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:43,698
Doucie may have found out something,
Sir John.

1018
01:10:44,491 --> 01:10:45,742
Won't you sit down?

1019
01:10:45,825 --> 01:10:46,826
Thanks.

1020
01:10:48,036 --> 01:10:49,889
You know that cigarette case
you found in the theater?

1021
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:52,475
Last night I wanted a smoke in bed,
just before I went off, you see?

1022
01:10:52,499 --> 01:10:54,000
So I took out that case.

1023
01:10:54,084 --> 01:10:57,629
Doucie saw it wasn't mine.
Said, "I've seen it before somewhere."

1024
01:10:57,712 --> 01:10:59,756
I said, "Whose is it?"
She said "Stewart's."

1025
01:10:59,839 --> 01:11:02,519
Then she took it. She noticed what
I thought was a beer stain on it.

1026
01:11:02,592 --> 01:11:04,528
I said, "Better give that a rub-up
before you send it back."

1027
01:11:04,552 --> 01:11:06,638
She says, "Wait a minute.
That's blood on it."

1028
01:11:06,721 --> 01:11:09,266
And sure enough...
Well, see for yourself, Sir John. Look.

1029
01:11:12,310 --> 01:11:13,937
I believe you're right.

1030
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,275
Stewart.

1031
01:11:20,568 --> 01:11:22,862
Who wore a policeman's uniform
in the farce you did here?

1032
01:11:22,946 --> 01:11:25,240
Uh, Fane and Stewart, sir.

1033
01:11:25,323 --> 01:11:28,076
Stewart had a quick change-over
with Fane in the third act,

1034
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:30,120
but Fane had a special uniform
made to fit him,

1035
01:11:30,203 --> 01:11:33,039
so we had two uniforms
in the company, Sir John.

1036
01:11:34,291 --> 01:11:36,710
You're an important factor
in this case, Markham.

1037
01:11:37,252 --> 01:11:39,587
In fact, the most important at the moment.

1038
01:11:39,671 --> 01:11:40,714
Well...

1039
01:11:41,756 --> 01:11:43,425
we're all here to help, Sir John.

1040
01:11:44,050 --> 01:11:47,429
No. The most important factor
seems to be a policeman

1041
01:11:47,512 --> 01:11:50,265
whom you did not see
on the night of the murder.

1042
01:11:50,724 --> 01:11:53,560
You remember your wife saw a policeman
coming down the street.

1043
01:11:53,643 --> 01:11:55,729
You went to the window,
and you couldn't see one.

1044
01:11:55,812 --> 01:11:57,522
Then suddenly there was a policeman.

1045
01:11:57,605 --> 01:11:58,606
Now, Markham...

1046
01:11:59,858 --> 01:12:02,027
that policeman was two different people.

1047
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:05,697
And for all we know, the first one

1048
01:12:05,780 --> 01:12:07,907
was not a member
of the county constabulary.

1049
01:12:08,199 --> 01:12:09,909
You mean the first one was a fake, sir?

1050
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:11,453
A chap in policeman's clothes?

1051
01:12:11,995 --> 01:12:15,707
Our next job is to find out
the name of the man Miss Baring withheld.

1052
01:12:16,374 --> 01:12:18,209
Was he a member of the company?

1053
01:12:18,293 --> 01:12:19,919
Did he wear a policeman's uniform?

1054
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,256
If she still refuses to give the name...

1055
01:12:26,885 --> 01:12:29,304
perhaps the cigarette case
will help her to remember.

1056
01:12:29,387 --> 01:12:32,724
You mean, the name of the man they were
calling about on the night of the murder?

1057
01:13:51,344 --> 01:13:52,762
This end, please.

1058
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,230
Won't you sit down?

1059
01:14:02,313 --> 01:14:04,232
Oh. Thank you.

1060
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:27,505
It's very good of you to have come.

1061
01:14:29,382 --> 01:14:31,176
But I can't help saying...

1062
01:14:33,845 --> 01:14:35,430
I'm extremely surprised.

1063
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:39,017
Well, you see, I...

1064
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:42,479
Naturally, I... I've taken
a very great interest in your case...

1065
01:14:42,562 --> 01:14:44,147
Don't let's talk about it.

1066
01:14:48,485 --> 01:14:50,737
How's your play going?

1067
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:53,031
Oh, pretty fair.

1068
01:14:54,324 --> 01:14:56,534
Of course, you know I was
away from it some time

1069
01:14:57,160 --> 01:14:59,996
because I was on the jury of your trial.

1070
01:15:03,917 --> 01:15:05,502
I know.

1071
01:15:08,046 --> 01:15:10,632
- I wondered...
- My country house is in that district.

1072
01:15:12,884 --> 01:15:14,594
As you know,

1073
01:15:14,677 --> 01:15:17,055
I can't discuss with you
what happened on the jury,

1074
01:15:17,722 --> 01:15:19,265
but I do want to tell you...

1075
01:15:19,349 --> 01:15:22,143
Is Muriel Heatherly
still playing lead with you?

1076
01:15:22,227 --> 01:15:23,228
Yes.

1077
01:15:23,311 --> 01:15:27,065
I do think she's such a good actress.
Don't you?

1078
01:15:28,399 --> 01:15:30,985
Miss Baring, you remember our meeting?

1079
01:15:32,153 --> 01:15:34,489
- Oh, yes.
- You do remember.

1080
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:38,034
Of course. very well.

1081
01:15:40,662 --> 01:15:41,996
You see,

1082
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:44,457
if I hadn't sent you away on tour
to get experience...

1083
01:15:45,875 --> 01:15:47,627
you wouldn't be in this position now.

1084
01:15:49,212 --> 01:15:51,756
That's, in a way, why I feel...

1085
01:15:51,839 --> 01:15:54,634
a sort of... responsibility.

1086
01:15:55,134 --> 01:15:56,594
That's why I've come.

1087
01:15:57,262 --> 01:16:00,557
There might be... there must be...
Some grounds for an appeal.

1088
01:16:04,936 --> 01:16:07,564
I knew that would happen.

1089
01:16:07,647 --> 01:16:11,526
I knew someone would try and get me off
and think they were doing me a kindness.

1090
01:16:12,360 --> 01:16:14,237
Imprisonment for life.

1091
01:16:16,406 --> 01:16:18,825
Why, a week of it's
nearly driven me crazy.

1092
01:16:22,745 --> 01:16:24,998
If they want to do the other thing...

1093
01:16:25,999 --> 01:16:27,250
they can.

1094
01:16:28,376 --> 01:16:30,837
I've fought it and got over it.

1095
01:16:32,839 --> 01:16:33,840
Except at night.

1096
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:37,176
It'll be no worse than the dentist.

1097
01:16:38,469 --> 01:16:42,682
And if I have done this thing,
in a fit, as they say I have...

1098
01:16:44,058 --> 01:16:45,602
I'm better out of the way.

1099
01:16:46,936 --> 01:16:49,105
As for the other thing,

1100
01:16:49,188 --> 01:16:51,274
if you're a friend to me,
you couldn't do it.

1101
01:16:52,984 --> 01:16:56,446
Lock yourself up
in your own room for one day,

1102
01:16:56,529 --> 01:16:58,406
only for one day, and see.

1103
01:16:59,657 --> 01:17:01,159
Tell me what I want to know...

1104
01:17:02,660 --> 01:17:04,140
I'll have you out of here altogether.

1105
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:09,626
What is there I can tell you?

1106
01:17:09,709 --> 01:17:13,463
Tell me the name of the man
discussed by you and Edna Druce.

1107
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:19,093
I've said so many times before,
he has no connection with the case.

1108
01:17:20,428 --> 01:17:23,264
Besides, I didn't quarrel.

1109
01:17:25,183 --> 01:17:26,809
I'll tell you now.

1110
01:17:26,893 --> 01:17:30,563
Edna Druce tried to say
poisonous things about him,

1111
01:17:30,647 --> 01:17:34,317
and-and I just put my fingers in my ears
and kept them there.

1112
01:17:35,652 --> 01:17:37,945
So that you actually
couldn't hear a sound.

1113
01:17:38,029 --> 01:17:40,669
You couldn't have heard if any other
person had come into the room.

1114
01:17:41,032 --> 01:17:44,243
No. I suppose I couldn't.

1115
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:46,079
Why wouldn't you listen to her?

1116
01:17:47,330 --> 01:17:48,581
Because...

1117
01:17:51,167 --> 01:17:53,586
I knew what Edna was trying to tell me.

1118
01:17:53,670 --> 01:17:55,463
What was she trying to tell you?

1119
01:17:57,298 --> 01:17:59,258
I can't answer that.

1120
01:18:00,677 --> 01:18:03,262
It involved... somebody else.

1121
01:18:03,971 --> 01:18:06,474
Plenty of other people
have been involved in this case.

1122
01:18:06,557 --> 01:18:09,811
Markham, Stewart, Druce, Fane.

1123
01:18:09,894 --> 01:18:12,146
Why shouldn't
this one man's name be mentioned?

1124
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:13,898
There was something...

1125
01:18:13,981 --> 01:18:15,983
something he daren't have known.

1126
01:18:17,276 --> 01:18:19,570
But which you knew.

1127
01:18:19,654 --> 01:18:20,655
Yes.

1128
01:18:21,447 --> 01:18:23,157
What was it?

1129
01:18:27,370 --> 01:18:30,248
You realize what you're admitting
by your silence?

1130
01:18:32,875 --> 01:18:36,629
You're shielding this man
because you know you're in love with him.

1131
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:40,216
Oh, but that's impossible.

1132
01:18:40,299 --> 01:18:42,468
Impossible? Why should it be impossible?

1133
01:18:42,552 --> 01:18:44,637
I see no reason
why it should be impossible.

1134
01:18:45,138 --> 01:18:46,848
Why, the man's a half-caste.

1135
01:18:49,475 --> 01:18:51,728
What's that? What did you say?

1136
01:18:53,020 --> 01:18:56,190
A half-caste? Black blood.

1137
01:18:57,442 --> 01:19:00,153
You've said so much. Tell me the rest.

1138
01:19:00,528 --> 01:19:01,612
What was his name?

1139
01:19:03,239 --> 01:19:05,533
I won't tell you that, ever.

1140
01:19:07,034 --> 01:19:10,074
Will this help you to remember the name
of the man you were quarreling about?

1141
01:19:10,913 --> 01:19:12,206
Stewart's cigarette case.

1142
01:19:12,582 --> 01:19:15,084
That's not Stewart's. It's Handell Fane's.

1143
01:19:15,168 --> 01:19:16,711
Fane's?

1144
01:19:16,794 --> 01:19:18,880
You mustn't give the prisoner
anything here, sir.

1145
01:19:19,589 --> 01:19:22,759
And the time for the interview
has nearly ended, sir.

1146
01:19:22,842 --> 01:19:25,136
Oh, Sir John, please,

1147
01:19:25,219 --> 01:19:28,765
for these last few moments,
let's talk about something else.

1148
01:19:29,807 --> 01:19:31,017
Yes.

1149
01:19:35,605 --> 01:19:37,607
There was a photograph of me in your room.

1150
01:19:38,524 --> 01:19:41,277
- How did you know?
- I went there to make inquiries.

1151
01:19:41,861 --> 01:19:43,654
How did you come to get it?

1152
01:19:45,656 --> 01:19:49,118
I've always been keen on the stage,
ever since I was a little girl.

1153
01:19:50,787 --> 01:19:52,455
One has one's heroes.

1154
01:19:53,456 --> 01:19:55,208
That's why I came to you for a job.

1155
01:19:56,918 --> 01:19:58,544
And I sent you away.

1156
01:19:59,962 --> 01:20:02,757
Oh, let's talk some more, quickly.

1157
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:05,843
Diana, I...

1158
01:20:07,970 --> 01:20:10,389
Miss Mitcham sent me some of my things,

1159
01:20:10,473 --> 01:20:11,933
your photograph with them.

1160
01:20:13,142 --> 01:20:16,020
I've got it in my cell now.
They let us keep some...

1161
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:17,647
Come. Time's up, please.

1162
01:20:24,028 --> 01:20:25,363
Good-bye.

1163
01:20:26,781 --> 01:20:28,908
I'm going to find Fane.

1164
01:20:33,162 --> 01:20:34,747
<i>- Handell Fane?
- Handell Fane?</i>

1165
01:20:34,831 --> 01:20:36,499
<i>- Handell Fane?
- Handell Fane?</i>

1166
01:20:36,874 --> 01:20:39,043
<i>What's become of Handell Fane?</i>

1167
01:20:39,126 --> 01:20:42,129
<i>- Any news of Fane yet, Markham?
- Not yet, Sir John.</i>

1168
01:20:42,213 --> 01:20:44,131
<i>I'm trying some more
of the agents, though.</i>

1169
01:20:44,215 --> 01:20:46,008
<i>Haven't you found Fane yet, Ted?</i>

1170
01:20:46,092 --> 01:20:48,386
<i>I can't bear the suspense.
We shall be too late, you know.</i>

1171
01:20:48,469 --> 01:20:50,054
<i>Oh, for God's sake.</i>

1172
01:20:51,097 --> 01:20:54,976
<i>Hello? Hello?
Hello, is that Lamberts, the agents?</i>

1173
01:20:55,059 --> 01:20:56,477
<i>Yes. You found Fane yet?</i>

1174
01:20:57,562 --> 01:20:59,647
<i>I want him for a most important job,
you know.</i>

1175
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:01,649
<i>Yes, at once.</i>

1176
01:21:01,732 --> 01:21:03,693
<i>What's that? Gone back to his old job?</i>

1177
01:21:04,443 --> 01:21:06,404
<i>What? Trapeze artist?</i>

1178
01:21:07,822 --> 01:21:09,740
<i>Under what name? Where?</i>

1179
01:21:10,825 --> 01:21:12,743
<i>No, can't stop now.</i>

1180
01:21:12,827 --> 01:21:14,245
<i>Got him at last.</i>

1181
01:21:19,667 --> 01:21:22,086
Yes, that's him, all right.

1182
01:21:22,169 --> 01:21:24,380
Dressed up as a woman, eh? Hmm.

1183
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:26,340
Always was good at that.

1184
01:21:27,717 --> 01:21:29,677
An extremely clever way of hiding.

1185
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,557
- Markham.
- Yes, sir?

1186
01:21:35,224 --> 01:21:36,767
I have an idea.

1187
01:21:38,853 --> 01:21:40,187
You know your <i>Hamlet?</i>

1188
01:21:40,271 --> 01:21:42,148
Every line of it, sir.

1189
01:21:42,231 --> 01:21:44,275
Then let me suggest for your consideration

1190
01:21:45,192 --> 01:21:48,821
the series of events embodied
in act 3, scene 2.

1191
01:21:48,905 --> 01:21:51,073
That's the play scene, isn't it, sir?

1192
01:21:51,157 --> 01:21:53,242
Yes, the play scene.

1193
01:21:54,744 --> 01:21:57,788
Do you remember the title, <i>The Mousetrap?</i>

1194
01:21:57,872 --> 01:21:59,498
Yes.

1195
01:21:59,582 --> 01:22:03,169
Well, when he comes to my theater
to read a part I shall offer him,

1196
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:04,754
there'll be three of us.

1197
01:22:06,213 --> 01:22:07,924
Two cats to one mouse.

1198
01:22:08,799 --> 01:22:11,302
Yes, but what about the cheese, sir?

1199
01:22:13,304 --> 01:22:15,598
The cheese, yes.

1200
01:22:15,681 --> 01:22:17,725
The cheese will be a fat part, Markham.

1201
01:22:18,851 --> 01:22:21,479
A villain's part in a "blood and thunder"

1202
01:22:21,562 --> 01:22:23,981
in a play that I'm going to write
specially for him.

1203
01:22:25,107 --> 01:22:27,985
A play based on
a recent well-known murder case.

1204
01:22:29,612 --> 01:22:31,989
I imagine he will play his part,

1205
01:22:32,073 --> 01:22:33,741
as I hope we shall convince him...

1206
01:22:34,867 --> 01:22:36,077
to the life.

1207
01:23:03,437 --> 01:23:04,605
Come in.

1208
01:23:05,606 --> 01:23:08,234
- Can you give me a minute?
- Certainly.

1209
01:23:09,360 --> 01:23:11,904
Oh. Who is that you have with you?

1210
01:23:16,742 --> 01:23:19,245
Of course, I remember.
This is the gentleman you suggested.

1211
01:23:19,328 --> 01:23:21,706
For Armitage, Sir John, Mr. Handell Fane.

1212
01:23:21,789 --> 01:23:23,249
Oh, yes. Do come in.

1213
01:23:26,335 --> 01:23:28,087
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

1214
01:23:28,170 --> 01:23:29,839
- Sit down.
- Thank you.

1215
01:23:38,305 --> 01:23:39,807
Oh, thank you.

1216
01:23:50,985 --> 01:23:51,986
Thank you.

1217
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:54,780
No, Bennett, don't go.

1218
01:23:55,740 --> 01:23:56,907
I may need you.

1219
01:23:59,035 --> 01:24:01,579
You see, I always conduct
these interviews so badly.

1220
01:24:01,662 --> 01:24:04,915
I'm just as likely as not to leave out
the really important points.

1221
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:09,462
Now, I suppose
I'd better begin by an explanation.

1222
01:24:09,545 --> 01:24:12,548
I daresay Mr. Bennett has told you
the author of the play?

1223
01:24:12,631 --> 01:24:16,886
No, Sir John. I understand you wish that
to be kept a secret for the time being.

1224
01:24:17,386 --> 01:24:18,846
Well, I wrote the play.

1225
01:24:19,597 --> 01:24:22,266
That was a simple matter,
but it's proving astonishingly difficult

1226
01:24:22,349 --> 01:24:25,061
to find the right person
for one particular part.

1227
01:24:26,854 --> 01:24:28,814
Might I ask you
to stand up for one moment?

1228
01:24:29,315 --> 01:24:30,483
Of course.

1229
01:24:35,780 --> 01:24:37,531
You know, Bennett, he looks it.

1230
01:24:38,157 --> 01:24:39,950
He looks it quite perfectly.

1231
01:24:40,034 --> 01:24:42,036
Exactly what I've been thinking, Sir John.

1232
01:24:43,037 --> 01:24:44,830
Would you mind... Oh, sit down, do.

1233
01:24:47,249 --> 01:24:51,087
Would you mind reading one or two lines,
just to give me some idea?

1234
01:24:51,170 --> 01:24:53,106
- Of course.
- I say, Bennett, this is quite illegible.

1235
01:24:53,130 --> 01:24:57,259
Tell what's-his-name, Waldren,
to bring me in a clean copy of act III.

1236
01:24:57,885 --> 01:24:59,095
Thank you.

1237
01:25:01,931 --> 01:25:04,600
Sir John, might I ask you...

1238
01:25:05,726 --> 01:25:08,312
what kind of play is this exactly?

1239
01:25:09,063 --> 01:25:11,148
Well, you may question my taste,

1240
01:25:11,232 --> 01:25:14,026
but as an artist,
you'll understand my temptation.

1241
01:25:20,574 --> 01:25:24,954
My subject, Mr. Fane,
is the inner history of the Baring case.

1242
01:25:29,416 --> 01:25:31,418
Oh. Thank you.

1243
01:25:32,586 --> 01:25:35,881
Really, your...
your indifference astonishes me.

1244
01:25:37,508 --> 01:25:38,735
Aren't I right in thinking that

1245
01:25:38,759 --> 01:25:41,137
you were a member
of the Druce company at the time?

1246
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:42,596
Yes, that is so.

1247
01:25:43,389 --> 01:25:45,558
Then you knew both women concerned.

1248
01:25:45,641 --> 01:25:47,309
Yes, I knew them both quite well.

1249
01:26:00,531 --> 01:26:01,824
Now, let's begin.

1250
01:26:03,951 --> 01:26:07,955
Oh, by the way, Mr. Fane, I understand
you're appearing at present at the circus.

1251
01:26:08,038 --> 01:26:10,791
- Would that interfere?
- No, it was my old job,

1252
01:26:10,875 --> 01:26:12,585
and I've gone back to it

1253
01:26:12,668 --> 01:26:14,712
because times have been
a little difficult, and...

1254
01:26:15,588 --> 01:26:19,466
However, I understand you wouldn't be
starting for two or three weeks.

1255
01:26:19,550 --> 01:26:21,510
No, I don't suppose so, no.

1256
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:29,685
Let me give you some idea of the scene.

1257
01:26:32,354 --> 01:26:36,859
Here is a table in front of a fireplace,
more or less as this is.

1258
01:26:37,735 --> 01:26:41,280
On the table,
there's the remains of a meal

1259
01:26:41,947 --> 01:26:44,992
and of course the brandy flask.

1260
01:26:47,912 --> 01:26:50,873
You know, Mr. Fane... Of course,
you know all the details of the case.

1261
01:26:51,749 --> 01:26:55,294
I can't help wondering
why nothing spectacular developed

1262
01:26:55,377 --> 01:26:57,129
in connection with the brandy.

1263
01:26:59,173 --> 01:27:00,925
Thinking as a dramatist,

1264
01:27:01,008 --> 01:27:04,386
I can't help feeling
that the brandy was not exploited

1265
01:27:04,470 --> 01:27:06,222
with sufficient imagination.

1266
01:27:07,890 --> 01:27:12,186
Then, of course,
the law has no sense of drama, has it?

1267
01:27:12,269 --> 01:27:13,354
- No.
- No.

1268
01:27:15,439 --> 01:27:17,650
Then again... now, let me see.

1269
01:27:17,733 --> 01:27:21,612
- I'm afraid I...
- I thought it best to begin from a point

1270
01:27:21,695 --> 01:27:23,739
just before the actual murder.

1271
01:27:30,955 --> 01:27:34,541
There's a short scene
between the two women

1272
01:27:34,625 --> 01:27:37,336
which turns into a quarrel.

1273
01:27:37,419 --> 01:27:41,257
In the middle of it,
you make your entrance on the words...

1274
01:27:41,757 --> 01:27:43,342
I got this from the evidence...

1275
01:27:43,425 --> 01:27:45,970
On the words, "Friends?

1276
01:27:46,053 --> 01:27:48,889
I can tell you things
about your friends that you don't know."

1277
01:27:50,516 --> 01:27:52,268
Just carry on from that point, would you?

1278
01:28:03,487 --> 01:28:06,282
Now, how on earth did you know
the entrance was from the window?

1279
01:28:07,199 --> 01:28:08,784
That's how I've made him enter.

1280
01:28:10,327 --> 01:28:11,578
And look, Mr. Fane.

1281
01:28:12,746 --> 01:28:14,039
You've forgotten your script.

1282
01:28:22,214 --> 01:28:23,590
The script.

1283
01:28:29,805 --> 01:28:32,224
Now, where are we? Ah, yes.

1284
01:28:32,933 --> 01:28:35,019
"Friends? I can tell you things..."

1285
01:28:36,228 --> 01:28:38,731
Wouldn't it be better
if I were to pick up the poker

1286
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:42,484
from the back fireplace
before I made the entrance to the room?

1287
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:51,952
Excellent idea. I'll put that in.

1288
01:28:59,084 --> 01:29:00,210
Thank you.

1289
01:29:02,004 --> 01:29:03,922
May I have the poker?

1290
01:29:08,218 --> 01:29:11,388
No, I'm terribly sorry.
We only have electric fires here.

1291
01:29:13,682 --> 01:29:14,767
Would this pencil do?

1292
01:29:29,656 --> 01:29:33,035
Very well.
We must get on without the poker.

1293
01:29:34,036 --> 01:29:35,662
You can use your imagination, eh?

1294
01:29:37,122 --> 01:29:38,415
Now, then.

1295
01:29:40,125 --> 01:29:41,377
Through the window,

1296
01:29:41,919 --> 01:29:43,087
into the room.

1297
01:29:44,463 --> 01:29:47,383
You creep through the double doors.

1298
01:29:47,466 --> 01:29:50,302
The two women are facing each other.

1299
01:29:51,220 --> 01:29:54,014
You come slowly around,
taking care not to be heard,

1300
01:29:54,765 --> 01:29:57,393
and gradually approach
the one whose back is to you.

1301
01:29:58,519 --> 01:30:01,188
Now you raise the poker
that is in your hand

1302
01:30:02,022 --> 01:30:04,191
as the other woman says,

1303
01:30:04,274 --> 01:30:07,111
"You fool!
Don't you know that he's a half..."

1304
01:30:35,180 --> 01:30:37,057
What a pity, Sir John.

1305
01:30:37,975 --> 01:30:39,393
The scene isn't finished.

1306
01:30:42,312 --> 01:30:45,691
I was getting quite worked up to it.

1307
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:56,785
I thought perhaps, Mr. Fane...

1308
01:30:57,870 --> 01:30:59,913
you might be able to collaborate with us.

1309
01:31:22,561 --> 01:31:24,438
I'm so sorry, Sir John.

1310
01:31:25,230 --> 01:31:29,902
I'm afraid I understand
so little about playwriting.

1311
01:31:35,574 --> 01:31:37,951
Perhaps later on...

1312
01:31:39,077 --> 01:31:41,288
when the script is finished,

1313
01:31:42,122 --> 01:31:44,791
you'll allow me to give you
another reading.

1314
01:32:14,905 --> 01:32:17,199
Find out what time Fane comes on tonight.

1315
01:32:38,595 --> 01:32:40,556
I shan't be a moment, Sir John.

1316
01:32:58,782 --> 01:33:00,659
How do you do, Sir John?

1317
01:33:03,745 --> 01:33:04,788
Markham.

1318
01:33:05,497 --> 01:33:07,291
Who'd have thought of seeing you here?

1319
01:33:08,166 --> 01:33:09,334
Well, you see, I'm, uh...

1320
01:33:10,627 --> 01:33:12,337
I'm working for Sir John now.

1321
01:33:13,046 --> 01:33:16,425
Yes. Mr. Markham is helping me
with my new play.

1322
01:33:20,846 --> 01:33:23,807
I suppose you find brandy
steadying for the nerves.

1323
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:27,519
Mine's very nervy work, you see, Sir John.

1324
01:33:28,353 --> 01:33:30,689
You never know what may happen.

1325
01:33:31,064 --> 01:33:32,983
Hurry up. You're next.

1326
01:33:35,652 --> 01:33:37,863
I presume you've come
to talk to me about...

1327
01:33:38,488 --> 01:33:40,574
that part again, Sir John.

1328
01:33:41,533 --> 01:33:43,827
You know perfectly well
what I've come here for.

1329
01:33:45,162 --> 01:33:47,706
Hurry up, Fane.
There'll be a wake if you're not careful.

1330
01:33:48,081 --> 01:33:50,834
If it isn't... How are you, Sir John?

1331
01:33:50,917 --> 01:33:52,377
Come to see the show?

1332
01:33:53,128 --> 01:33:54,379
No, not exactly.

1333
01:33:55,213 --> 01:33:57,215
I've really come to see Mr. Fane.

1334
01:34:00,719 --> 01:34:04,765
Sir John, if you wouldn't mind
coming down to see me after my act,

1335
01:34:04,848 --> 01:34:08,935
I shall only be too pleased to talk over
that little matter we were discussing.

1336
01:39:25,794 --> 01:39:27,921
For God sakes, play something!

1337
01:39:32,509 --> 01:39:35,136
Boy, that's it! He's done it on us!

1338
01:39:43,186 --> 01:39:46,106
Ah,
Fane says he has decided to collaborate

1339
01:39:46,189 --> 01:39:48,483
in my play after all.

1340
01:39:49,693 --> 01:39:50,694
He says...

1341
01:39:51,736 --> 01:39:55,532
"The two women are standing,
facing each other in dead silence.

1342
01:39:56,574 --> 01:39:59,119
They are so lost
in the tension of the moment

1343
01:39:59,202 --> 01:40:00,870
that they do not hear the murderer

1344
01:40:00,954 --> 01:40:03,164
creep through the double doors
into the room.

1345
01:40:03,748 --> 01:40:06,334
The murdered woman
is at that instant going to speak.

1346
01:40:07,085 --> 01:40:08,878
The murderer springs forward.

1347
01:40:09,838 --> 01:40:11,548
He hurls the first woman aside.

1348
01:40:12,424 --> 01:40:14,884
She's stunned by the fall,
but he doesn't notice it.

1349
01:40:15,593 --> 01:40:17,220
Infuriated,

1350
01:40:17,303 --> 01:40:19,389
he strikes out at the other woman
with the poker.

1351
01:40:20,265 --> 01:40:21,808
She falls by the fireplace.

1352
01:40:23,226 --> 01:40:24,310
She's dead.

1353
01:40:25,270 --> 01:40:27,355
He nearly faints
at the sight of the blood.

1354
01:40:28,023 --> 01:40:29,733
He drinks the brandy.

1355
01:40:30,525 --> 01:40:32,777
Then he sees the other woman
beginning to stir.

1356
01:40:33,028 --> 01:40:34,320
He must get away.

1357
01:40:34,904 --> 01:40:37,407
Through the back window, a leap or two.

1358
01:40:37,907 --> 01:40:41,619
Finally, a climb
into the theater dressing room."

1359
01:40:42,120 --> 01:40:43,830
That accounts for the broken basin.

1360
01:40:44,789 --> 01:40:47,167
"But how to get home
undetected from the theater?

1361
01:40:47,792 --> 01:40:49,586
An idea...

1362
01:40:49,669 --> 01:40:52,005
The policeman's uniform
he wore on the stage."

1363
01:40:52,547 --> 01:40:55,050
There's your policeman, Markham.

1364
01:40:55,133 --> 01:40:57,218
"He walks home a murderer,

1365
01:40:57,886 --> 01:40:59,220
a murderer on an impulse,

1366
01:40:59,679 --> 01:41:02,098
to silence the mouth of a woman
who knew his secret

1367
01:41:02,891 --> 01:41:05,643
and was going to reveal it
to the woman he dared to love.

1368
01:41:06,311 --> 01:41:08,563
There's a melodrama for you, Sir John."

1369
01:41:11,149 --> 01:41:12,192
Well, Markham,

1370
01:41:13,068 --> 01:41:14,235
you have it all.

1371
01:41:15,445 --> 01:41:16,613
Poor devil.

1372
01:41:17,989 --> 01:41:18,990
And Diana Baring...

1373
01:41:20,200 --> 01:41:23,453
she knew all the time he was a half-caste.
