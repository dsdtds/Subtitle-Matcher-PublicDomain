1
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:22,066
Andy.

2
00:02:22,606 --> 00:02:25,070
You go outside and see everything
is locked up for the night.

3
00:02:28,263 --> 00:02:29,554
Alright, Mr Bradford.

4
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:12,034
Stay where you are and
keep your trap shut.

5
00:03:19,238 --> 00:03:20,262
Hello, Whitey.

6
00:03:22,412 --> 00:03:24,607
I thought you had ten
more years to serve.

7
00:03:25,193 --> 00:03:25,966
Yes.

8
00:03:27,118 --> 00:03:30,097
But I was so anxious to get square
with you that I busted out.

9
00:03:30,993 --> 00:03:32,953
I could have knocked you
off when I first came in.

10
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,890
But I had to face the judge when he gave
me my rap and I want you to do the same.

11
00:03:37,513 --> 00:03:39,494
You are crazy. Maybe stir-crazy.

12
00:03:40,127 --> 00:03:41,691
If I am, I got you to blame for it.

13
00:03:42,976 --> 00:03:44,535
I've been laying up there in the Pen.

14
00:03:44,757 --> 00:03:47,031
While the Black Raven has been
doing pretty good for himself.

15
00:03:47,831 --> 00:03:49,789
We were partners when
the dough was rolling in.

16
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:53,316
But when the law tracked me down
you don't know me from a yellow dog.

17
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:56,472
All of a sudden you'd got
too smart to take orders.

18
00:03:57,949 --> 00:03:59,604
When I saw what was coming I ..

19
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,783
Protected myself.

20
00:04:02,966 --> 00:04:05,099
Why should I get into a jam
because you were a fool?

21
00:04:05,684 --> 00:04:06,728
That is your story.

22
00:04:07,371 --> 00:04:09,105
The way it looks from where I stand ..

23
00:04:10,242 --> 00:04:12,495
You double-crossed me so
you could grab the works.

24
00:04:14,213 --> 00:04:15,936
You could be wrong about that.

25
00:04:16,819 --> 00:04:17,434
Yes.

26
00:04:18,365 --> 00:04:19,529
And I could be right.

27
00:04:27,784 --> 00:04:30,143
You weren't satisfied
with a fifty percent cut.

28
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:33,409
Well, now I am going to give
you a hundred percent payoff.

29
00:04:39,157 --> 00:04:40,340
Andy, come here quick.

30
00:04:43,648 --> 00:04:45,436
Alright. Go easy, man.
Don't break his neck.

31
00:04:45,643 --> 00:04:47,086
I wanted to make sure I had him.

32
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:48,951
There's no doubt about that.

33
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:52,476
He don't know his own strength.

34
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,389
We'll take him to my room.
Bring him along.

35
00:04:59,305 --> 00:05:00,378
Bring me that chair.

36
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:13,247
What's the matter?
Didn't he like the service?

37
00:05:13,633 --> 00:05:17,416
He is suffering from rapid delusions
aggravated by a moronic mentality.

38
00:05:18,035 --> 00:05:20,206
Is that bad?
- It might prove fatal.

39
00:05:21,065 --> 00:05:22,281
I hope it ain't catching.

40
00:05:23,193 --> 00:05:25,271
Let up on me, Raven.
I won't bother you no more.

41
00:05:25,929 --> 00:05:28,089
I'm quite sure you won't
bother me anymore.

42
00:05:28,588 --> 00:05:29,804
What will you do with me?

43
00:05:30,110 --> 00:05:33,199
You still have ten more years to serve.
That will keep you busy for a while.

44
00:05:33,568 --> 00:05:34,554
Don't turn me in.

45
00:05:34,761 --> 00:05:36,807
I'll promise to leave the
country and not come back.

46
00:05:37,014 --> 00:05:40,269
I'd be a fool to take a chance on
trusting you when I don't have to.

47
00:06:42,712 --> 00:06:45,104
I'm told you can slip a hot guy
across the Canadian border.

48
00:06:46,785 --> 00:06:48,051
I don't think I know you.

49
00:06:48,421 --> 00:06:49,437
I am Mike Bardoni.

50
00:06:50,075 --> 00:06:51,262
You are the Black Raven.

51
00:06:53,827 --> 00:06:55,345
Have that mug put my car away.

52
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,650
Andy.

53
00:06:57,292 --> 00:06:59,590
I would like to dry off
sometime tonight.

54
00:07:02,115 --> 00:07:03,846
Maybe you would like
to see today's paper?

55
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,780
Register please.
- I don't think so.

56
00:07:19,161 --> 00:07:20,806
I'm in a hurry to get across the border.

57
00:07:21,013 --> 00:07:23,339
It's liable to rain all night.
You may as well be comfortable.

58
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:25,148
Maybe I had better.

59
00:07:58,892 --> 00:08:00,398
Mike Bardoni the big-shot.

60
00:08:01,371 --> 00:08:03,240
In solid with the state organisation.

61
00:08:04,427 --> 00:08:05,845
A shady underground character.

62
00:08:07,042 --> 00:08:08,086
What is the answer?

63
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,761
My racket is paying off big.

64
00:08:09,983 --> 00:08:12,554
So Tim Winfield decides to take
over and makes me an office boy.

65
00:08:13,868 --> 00:08:16,120
When I don't play that way
he tosses me to the coppers.

66
00:08:17,228 --> 00:08:19,359
I'll come back when the heat
is off and settle with him.

67
00:08:20,238 --> 00:08:21,447
Tim Winfield, huh?

68
00:08:22,189 --> 00:08:23,494
He's a bad man to fool with.

69
00:08:24,027 --> 00:08:25,556
Others have learned the hard way.

70
00:08:26,067 --> 00:08:27,608
Alright. So it won't be easy.

71
00:08:28,349 --> 00:08:30,395
Do you think I got where I
did by being a cream-puff?

72
00:08:30,876 --> 00:08:31,956
How about some grub?

73
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:33,664
I didn't have time to stop and eat.

74
00:08:34,046 --> 00:08:35,433
I'll see what I can do for you.

75
00:09:00,376 --> 00:09:03,699
Listen, buddy. The bridge is washed out.
You'll have to turn back.

76
00:09:04,136 --> 00:09:06,390
Oh dear. Are you sure
I cannot get through?

77
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:10,162
I just said the bridge was
washed out. I am sorry.

78
00:09:10,678 --> 00:09:11,926
Just a minute, mister.

79
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:14,554
Are you sure it's impossible to cross?

80
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:20,356
Listen, buddy. If was possible to cross,
you don't think I'd be standing here?

81
00:09:20,963 --> 00:09:22,448
No. Of course not.

82
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,534
But how am I going to get over?

83
00:09:26,055 --> 00:09:27,444
You are not.

84
00:09:28,402 --> 00:09:31,488
But is there no other way?
This is a matter of life and death.

85
00:09:31,953 --> 00:09:33,136
Whose? Yours or mine?

86
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:35,091
Please. Now, you're joking.

87
00:09:35,757 --> 00:09:37,002
There must be other roads.

88
00:09:37,457 --> 00:09:39,819
So there is, but they're all washed out.

89
00:09:40,923 --> 00:09:44,214
Have you any idea how long it will
be before the bridge will be fixed?

90
00:09:45,524 --> 00:09:49,074
That just depends upon how
long this storm is going to last.

91
00:09:49,764 --> 00:09:51,764
But if you must wait a while.

92
00:09:52,215 --> 00:09:55,361
There's a little shack down the road
belonging to the Highway Police.

93
00:09:55,829 --> 00:09:59,209
No. If I have to wait I'd much
rather take a room for the night.

94
00:09:59,584 --> 00:10:01,356
Or until the storm subsides.

95
00:10:01,937 --> 00:10:05,191
Then turn back about a mile to a
place called The Black Raven.

96
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:08,172
They might be able to put you up.
- Thank you.

97
00:10:08,594 --> 00:10:09,810
You are welcome.

98
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,917
The bridge has been washed out.
You will have to turn back.

99
00:10:30,965 --> 00:10:33,434
Do you have any idea how long it
will be before we can get through?

100
00:10:33,814 --> 00:10:35,509
I'm afraid it won't be for some time.

101
00:10:35,895 --> 00:10:37,541
Is there another way across the border?

102
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:40,226
No, sir. All the other bridges
have been washed out too.

103
00:10:41,034 --> 00:10:43,859
Do you know of a place round here where
we can stay until the storm blows over?

104
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:47,140
A mile back down the road is a
place called The Black Raven.

105
00:10:47,487 --> 00:10:49,589
I am sure you can get
accommodation for the night.

106
00:10:49,811 --> 00:10:51,049
The black Raven?
- Yes.

107
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:52,801
Thanks very much.
- You're welcome.

108
00:10:56,117 --> 00:10:58,247
What are we going to do?
- I don't know, darling.

109
00:10:58,777 --> 00:11:00,092
But we're not giving up.

110
00:11:00,314 --> 00:11:03,745
Even if your dad's political influence
stopped us from marrying in this state.

111
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:06,233
I wish we had not tried to elope.
- Why, dear?

112
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,901
Father is a vindictive man and I'm
afraid he will make trouble for you.

113
00:11:10,596 --> 00:11:12,486
He has no political influence in Canada.

114
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,014
We're not in Canada yet.

115
00:11:14,355 --> 00:11:16,554
No, but we will be.
We'll manage somehow in the morning.

116
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:19,150
I hope so.
Before father catches up with us.

117
00:11:19,798 --> 00:11:22,351
We'd better get out of here
before this storm gets any worse.

118
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:01,123
I beg your pardon.

119
00:12:03,094 --> 00:12:04,381
I beg your pardon.

120
00:12:04,906 --> 00:12:06,090
Yeah? What for?

121
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:09,524
I just beg your pardon. That's all.

122
00:12:09,912 --> 00:12:11,201
Don't bother me, screwball.

123
00:12:12,626 --> 00:12:13,971
Are you the proprietor?

124
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:15,146
No, no.

125
00:12:15,402 --> 00:12:17,304
He's in the kitchen scaring
up something to eat.

126
00:12:18,936 --> 00:12:19,808
Good evening.

127
00:12:20,823 --> 00:12:21,867
Do you want a room?

128
00:12:22,102 --> 00:12:24,498
Yes. The highway bridge is washed out.

129
00:12:25,089 --> 00:12:25,914
So I heard.

130
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:27,419
Let me take these.

131
00:12:27,647 --> 00:12:29,187
Never mind. I will carry these.

132
00:12:30,727 --> 00:12:32,112
Alright. This way please.

133
00:12:41,645 --> 00:12:42,813
Register please.

134
00:12:59,782 --> 00:13:00,740
Going to Canada?

135
00:13:03,505 --> 00:13:05,838
Yes. I thought I would
spend my vacation up there.

136
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:07,634
Excuse me.

137
00:13:16,193 --> 00:13:17,781
Why don't you watch what you're doing?

138
00:13:18,175 --> 00:13:20,454
Sorry, pal. I hope I didn't
break your bottle of Cologne.

139
00:13:23,935 --> 00:13:25,306
I'll show you up to your room.

140
00:13:31,759 --> 00:13:34,397
Andy, there is another car outside
that wants putting away.

141
00:13:35,245 --> 00:13:36,088
Another one?

142
00:13:37,761 --> 00:13:39,556
If this keeps up I'll never get dry.

143
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:41,832
Let Andy have the key to your car.

144
00:13:42,173 --> 00:13:43,588
Yes. Of course.

145
00:13:46,324 --> 00:13:47,196
Come with me.

146
00:13:59,761 --> 00:14:01,090
Nasty weather for travelling.

147
00:14:01,297 --> 00:14:03,816
That is an understatement.
The bridge is washed out, you know.

148
00:14:04,138 --> 00:14:05,488
I know. Register please.

149
00:14:07,035 --> 00:14:07,879
Yes. Thanks.

150
00:14:30,766 --> 00:14:31,667
Miss Winfield.

151
00:14:32,296 --> 00:14:33,625
Any relation to Tim Winfield?

152
00:14:33,832 --> 00:14:35,592
He's my father. Do you know him?

153
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:38,221
I know him by reputation.
He's a very prominent man.

154
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,942
You see, we like his blessing.

155
00:14:40,163 --> 00:14:42,180
That's why we plan to get
married across the border.

156
00:14:42,893 --> 00:14:44,332
I can well understand that.

157
00:14:48,967 --> 00:14:50,930
I may as well take you
all up at the same time.

158
00:14:51,154 --> 00:14:51,798
Fine.

159
00:14:54,827 --> 00:14:56,495
Would you pardon me for just a moment?

160
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:02,798
If you're ready I'll have
Andy take you on your way.

161
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,919
There is no hurry.

162
00:15:05,512 --> 00:15:06,871
I'll stick around for a while.

163
00:15:07,584 --> 00:15:08,733
I like it here.

164
00:15:09,894 --> 00:15:10,808
Suit yourself.

165
00:15:12,878 --> 00:15:13,693
I am sorry.

166
00:15:14,432 --> 00:15:15,390
This way please.

167
00:15:49,301 --> 00:15:51,107
Andy will be with you
in a minute, Mr Smith.

168
00:15:51,314 --> 00:15:52,100
Thank you.

169
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:03,570
I hope you'll find this room
comfortable, Miss Winfield.

170
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:09,603
It's very nice. Thank you.

171
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:12,330
I can give you a room across
the hall, Mr Bentley.

172
00:16:12,684 --> 00:16:15,044
That will be fine, thank you.
I'll be with you in just a minute.

173
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:19,666
I'm terribly afraid.

174
00:16:19,892 --> 00:16:21,651
Everything is going to
be alright, darling.

175
00:16:22,101 --> 00:16:25,707
We cross the border and marry in spite
of Mr Winfield and all he stands for.

176
00:16:31,681 --> 00:16:32,532
Remember.

177
00:16:32,917 --> 00:16:33,914
Don't worry.

178
00:17:13,036 --> 00:17:14,885
Thanks for following me up here, Tim.

179
00:17:16,913 --> 00:17:17,986
I didn't follow you.

180
00:17:18,645 --> 00:17:20,082
What you do means nothing to me.

181
00:17:20,482 --> 00:17:22,716
I won't be surprised if you
change your mind about that.

182
00:17:23,307 --> 00:17:24,752
I don't like to be kicked around.

183
00:17:25,399 --> 00:17:26,758
You'll outgrow your hat, Mike.

184
00:17:27,147 --> 00:17:29,369
There's no-one the organisation
can't get along without.

185
00:17:29,813 --> 00:17:30,829
Glad to hear that.

186
00:17:31,069 --> 00:17:32,952
Because they may have
to get along without you.

187
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:38,254
Well.

188
00:17:41,219 --> 00:17:44,299
Seldom have I had such a
distinguished guest as Mr Winfield.

189
00:17:44,805 --> 00:17:45,735
Do you know me?

190
00:17:46,186 --> 00:17:47,516
I have had business with you.

191
00:17:47,938 --> 00:17:48,753
Indirectly.

192
00:17:50,128 --> 00:17:51,583
You seem to have got wet.
- Yes.

193
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,346
My car went into the ditch.
I had to walk half a mile or so.

194
00:17:54,872 --> 00:17:56,108
That's too bad.

195
00:17:57,395 --> 00:17:59,935
Put on this coat of mine, why don't you.
While your coat dries.

196
00:18:00,308 --> 00:18:01,043
Thanks.

197
00:18:01,489 --> 00:18:03,320
That may help me from catching cold.

198
00:18:09,949 --> 00:18:11,977
What business did you have with me?

199
00:18:12,531 --> 00:18:13,346
Indirectly.

200
00:18:14,152 --> 00:18:16,650
I don't think you'd be interested
in talking about that now.

201
00:18:17,841 --> 00:18:19,572
Excuse me while I get
a jacket for myself.

202
00:18:45,255 --> 00:18:46,642
There is another car out front.

203
00:18:48,673 --> 00:18:50,527
Pardon me.
I thought you were Mr Bradford.

204
00:18:52,523 --> 00:18:53,579
Andy. Come here.

205
00:18:57,311 --> 00:18:59,176
Mr Bradford, there's
another car out front.

206
00:18:59,646 --> 00:19:01,469
Never mind about that.
That prisoner escaped.

207
00:19:01,676 --> 00:19:04,108
We must search the house from top
to bottom. We have to find him.

208
00:19:04,485 --> 00:19:06,324
Who searches for who?
He may be dangerous.

209
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:09,190
He is. Very dangerous, and that's
why you must find him right away.

210
00:19:09,656 --> 00:19:11,286
That don't make me anxious to find him.

211
00:19:20,578 --> 00:19:22,789
Where is Bentley?
I've been trying to catch up with him.

212
00:19:23,717 --> 00:19:25,884
I don't give information
about my guests.

213
00:19:26,195 --> 00:19:27,211
You know who I am.

214
00:19:27,491 --> 00:19:29,823
You'd better cooperate with me
if you hope to stay in business.

215
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,341
I warned you to stay
away from my daughter.

216
00:19:39,788 --> 00:19:41,376
You brought her here.
- That's right.

217
00:19:41,673 --> 00:19:43,375
As soon as we reach
Canada we will marry.

218
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,030
You will never get to Canada.

219
00:19:45,802 --> 00:19:46,961
Look here, Mr Winfield.

220
00:19:47,318 --> 00:19:48,562
Lee and I love each other.

221
00:19:48,782 --> 00:19:49,998
Not even you can stop us.

222
00:19:54,675 --> 00:19:56,035
I could kill you for that.

223
00:19:56,429 --> 00:19:58,458
A lot of people have felt
that same way about me.

224
00:19:59,209 --> 00:20:00,953
But I'm still very much alive.

225
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:04,690
I hope for Lee's sake that you and I
may someday you may be reconciled.

226
00:20:05,276 --> 00:20:07,064
But I won't take that.
Not from her father.

227
00:20:07,405 --> 00:20:08,730
You'll take more than that.

228
00:20:09,165 --> 00:20:10,524
I haven't even started on you.

229
00:20:11,228 --> 00:20:12,626
Lee is not quite 21.

230
00:20:13,241 --> 00:20:15,607
And I am going to have you
prosecuted for kidnapping.

231
00:20:16,214 --> 00:20:17,678
I'll make sure you get the limit.

232
00:20:18,316 --> 00:20:19,091
Andy.

233
00:20:19,814 --> 00:20:21,711
Don't stand around there.
Do what I told you.

234
00:20:23,354 --> 00:20:24,112
Yes, sir.

235
00:20:32,392 --> 00:20:34,438
Connect me with the headquarters
of the state police.

236
00:20:35,586 --> 00:20:37,178
That's what I said. The state police.

237
00:20:40,723 --> 00:20:41,910
What is going to happen?

238
00:20:42,254 --> 00:20:43,765
Why is father calling the police?

239
00:20:44,378 --> 00:20:46,910
He'd call out the marines if he could
to keep us from getting married.

240
00:20:49,977 --> 00:20:50,747
Operator.

241
00:20:51,948 --> 00:20:53,164
Operator. Are you asleep?

242
00:20:57,169 --> 00:20:58,213
This phone is dead.

243
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:00,244
It was alright a minute ago.

244
00:21:00,977 --> 00:21:03,043
You probably noticed there
is a bad storm going on.

245
00:21:04,413 --> 00:21:05,543
Anything could happen.

246
00:21:12,192 --> 00:21:14,009
Once more, I forbid you
to marry this fellow.

247
00:21:14,216 --> 00:21:15,460
And I expect to be obeyed.

248
00:21:15,821 --> 00:21:18,761
You have no right to let a stubborn
prejudice interfere with my happiness.

249
00:21:19,174 --> 00:21:20,441
I'll be the judge of that.

250
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,409
You'll go to your room and you'll
stay there until I can take you home.

251
00:21:24,398 --> 00:21:26,736
You are a fool to think you
could put anything over on me.

252
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,141
Keep your chin up.

253
00:21:50,444 --> 00:21:52,547
The breaks can't always be against you.
- Thanks.

254
00:21:52,865 --> 00:21:54,367
Things look pretty black right now.

255
00:22:15,964 --> 00:22:18,525
You dislike Allen because he had the
courage to oppose you on politics.

256
00:22:19,033 --> 00:22:20,711
Why should you care who I marry?

257
00:22:21,111 --> 00:22:22,831
You've never shown
much affection for me.

258
00:22:23,122 --> 00:22:26,399
You can hardly expect me to show much
love for a father I can't even respect.

259
00:22:26,689 --> 00:22:27,947
What do you mean by that?

260
00:22:28,309 --> 00:22:31,464
Don't you suppose I can understand the
dirty politics that's kept you in power?

261
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,369
Do you think I'm such a fool as to
not know where you get your money?

262
00:22:34,576 --> 00:22:37,134
I can also thank Bentley for turning
you against your own father.

263
00:22:37,444 --> 00:22:38,774
He had nothing to do with it.

264
00:22:39,175 --> 00:22:41,955
I knew about you before I met him.
- You'd better start to forget him.

265
00:22:42,433 --> 00:22:43,934
Because you'll not see him anymore.

266
00:23:10,947 --> 00:23:11,591
Help.

267
00:23:13,116 --> 00:23:13,760
Help.

268
00:23:15,581 --> 00:23:17,208
Someone tried to break into my room.

269
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:19,668
A man or a woman?
- A man I suppose.

270
00:23:19,927 --> 00:23:21,744
Why would a woman want
to break into my room?

271
00:23:21,951 --> 00:23:23,080
I guess you are right.

272
00:23:24,071 --> 00:23:26,767
This is no joking matter.
My life may be in danger.

273
00:23:27,089 --> 00:23:29,049
Alright. I will go and look
under the bed for you.

274
00:23:44,223 --> 00:23:45,573
Everything is alright here.

275
00:23:46,188 --> 00:23:47,774
Someone tried to open that door.

276
00:23:57,895 --> 00:23:59,994
That door is locked.
It must have rattled in the wind.

277
00:24:00,327 --> 00:24:03,673
I don't think so. It sounded exactly as
if someone was trying to pick the lock.

278
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:05,174
Just your imagination.

279
00:24:12,831 --> 00:24:15,540
You look very familiar to me.
Where have I seen you before?

280
00:24:16,427 --> 00:24:18,295
I am sure we've never met before.

281
00:24:18,737 --> 00:24:20,960
I suppose I remind you of someone else.

282
00:24:21,639 --> 00:24:22,769
I never forget a face.

283
00:24:23,606 --> 00:24:26,111
Something about you is
impressed in my memory.

284
00:24:27,350 --> 00:24:28,790
Maybe it's the decorations.

285
00:24:32,092 --> 00:24:32,850
I got it.

286
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:35,698
You are Horace Weatherby.
The missing bank cashier.

287
00:24:36,379 --> 00:24:38,101
I have seen your picture in the papers.

288
00:24:38,308 --> 00:24:39,924
I don't know what you're talking about.

289
00:24:40,564 --> 00:24:42,982
How much did you get away with?
- I didn't get away with anything.

290
00:24:43,509 --> 00:24:46,628
I'm on my vacation and I have a right to
go where I like and do what I please.

291
00:24:47,116 --> 00:24:48,515
How much did you get away with?

292
00:24:49,534 --> 00:24:51,803
I could find out for myself
by opening that satchel.

293
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:53,126
No. Wait a minute.

294
00:24:53,426 --> 00:24:54,327
I'll tell you.

295
00:24:54,994 --> 00:24:56,392
Fifty thousand dollars.

296
00:24:57,003 --> 00:24:58,559
That's far from being peanuts.

297
00:24:59,712 --> 00:25:01,357
You'd better turn that money over to me.

298
00:25:01,645 --> 00:25:02,521
No. I won't.

299
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,949
This is my last and only chance
to live and I won't give it up.

300
00:25:06,810 --> 00:25:09,610
All my life I've been nothing but
an animated adding machine.

301
00:25:09,957 --> 00:25:11,966
I wasn't supposed to have
any feelings or emotions.

302
00:25:12,708 --> 00:25:15,183
They just wound me up once a
week with the little salary check ..

303
00:25:15,390 --> 00:25:17,578
That was supposed to make me
tick until the next Saturday.

304
00:25:18,224 --> 00:25:21,916
And traveling back and forth to work
in that crowd in the sweat and garlic.

305
00:25:22,623 --> 00:25:25,847
All I could think of was fresh
air and the out of doors.

306
00:25:27,263 --> 00:25:30,228
I never planned to embezzle any
money but the chance came one day.

307
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:31,401
And I took it.

308
00:25:31,693 --> 00:25:33,349
That money goes back where it belongs.

309
00:25:33,663 --> 00:25:36,036
I can't give it back now
that I've gone this far.

310
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:38,396
I have no desire to see
you sent to prison.

311
00:25:39,138 --> 00:25:41,561
If I take that money back you
are free to do what you like.

312
00:25:42,853 --> 00:25:44,964
It's that or stand trial
for embezzlement.

313
00:27:22,083 --> 00:27:23,299
They took me from behind.

314
00:27:23,596 --> 00:27:25,012
Who?
- The whole bunch of them.

315
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:31,671
Take your foot out of that clothesline
and you won't be attacked anymore.

316
00:27:34,163 --> 00:27:37,106
It could have been a fellow that
tried to kill you. How was I to know?

317
00:27:38,675 --> 00:27:40,021
You go up the back stairs.

318
00:27:40,543 --> 00:27:43,130
I'll look around here for a while.
I'll meet you on the second floor.

319
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:25,524
It's none of my business.

320
00:29:26,042 --> 00:29:28,682
It might be a good idea if you were
to keep out of sight for a while.

321
00:29:29,731 --> 00:29:30,861
I'm not running away.

322
00:29:43,926 --> 00:29:46,047
Mr Bradford. I found a dead man.

323
00:29:46,721 --> 00:29:48,051
I pretty near stepped on him.

324
00:29:55,814 --> 00:29:57,125
[ Thunderclap ]

325
00:29:57,848 --> 00:29:58,635
Hear that?

326
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:10,571
Dead.

327
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:13,695
Something must have hit him
a terrific blow on the head.

328
00:30:14,077 --> 00:30:16,522
It gave me a funny feeling when
I saw him there with your robe on.

329
00:30:16,982 --> 00:30:18,455
For a minute I thought it was you.

330
00:30:19,124 --> 00:30:21,239
Did you look to see if anyone
was hiding in the rooms?

331
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,223
No, sir. As soon as I saw that corpse.

332
00:30:23,628 --> 00:30:24,677
I left right now.

333
00:30:27,942 --> 00:30:29,573
Let me out. Let me out of here!

334
00:30:31,196 --> 00:30:32,355
You'd better stay here.

335
00:30:37,584 --> 00:30:38,628
Let me out of here.

336
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:44,501
What's happened?
Why is everybody so excited?

337
00:30:44,891 --> 00:30:46,336
Your father met with an accident.

338
00:30:46,995 --> 00:30:48,864
Where is he?
- Best for you to stay here.

339
00:31:10,733 --> 00:31:11,977
You don't think that I ..?

340
00:31:13,982 --> 00:31:15,484
No. You couldn't have.

341
00:31:26,037 --> 00:31:27,117
Oh dear. How awful.

342
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:28,545
How did it happen?

343
00:31:29,249 --> 00:31:30,931
Evidently someone didn't like him.

344
00:31:33,463 --> 00:31:34,078
Oh.

345
00:32:05,767 --> 00:32:06,954
There's nobody upstairs.

346
00:32:08,049 --> 00:32:09,790
One of our guests seems to be missing.

347
00:32:10,335 --> 00:32:12,888
Yeah. How about the fellow
that signed the register?

348
00:32:13,274 --> 00:32:14,140
John Smith.

349
00:32:14,470 --> 00:32:16,290
There is your murderer.
- It might be.

350
00:32:42,690 --> 00:32:45,198
Go and see if any cars are missing
and make sure that none leave.

351
00:32:45,619 --> 00:32:46,409
Yes, sir.

352
00:33:01,831 --> 00:33:03,446
Come on in and shut the door.

353
00:33:10,350 --> 00:33:11,394
Where's that money?

354
00:33:11,741 --> 00:33:13,925
Is that the 64-dollar question?
- Quit stalling.

355
00:33:14,518 --> 00:33:17,403
That little shrimp had 50 grand in his
satchel and Winfield took it from him.

356
00:33:17,881 --> 00:33:19,297
Somebody has got that money now.

357
00:33:19,928 --> 00:33:21,002
And it could be you.

358
00:33:22,485 --> 00:33:23,781
So you killed Winfield?

359
00:33:24,082 --> 00:33:26,430
We won't worry about who killed
Winfield. Where is that dough?

360
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,138
I don't know.

361
00:33:28,964 --> 00:33:30,466
Thank you for telling me about him.

362
00:33:31,181 --> 00:33:33,050
Maybe I'm wrong. I don't know.

363
00:33:34,007 --> 00:33:36,453
Maybe that young fellow got himself
a wedding present the hard way.

364
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:39,198
Anything is possible but I don't
believe that's the answer.

365
00:33:39,405 --> 00:33:40,592
Where is that money now?

366
00:33:40,922 --> 00:33:42,803
It isn't a pigeon that
can fly home by itself.

367
00:34:08,229 --> 00:34:11,581
They should keep that cellar door locked
before somebody breaks their neck.

368
00:34:28,810 --> 00:34:29,987
Mr Bradford!

369
00:34:33,308 --> 00:34:34,495
Mr Bradford.

370
00:34:35,684 --> 00:34:36,741
Mr Bradford.

371
00:34:38,071 --> 00:34:40,288
What is it this time?
- There's someone down in the cellar.

372
00:34:41,241 --> 00:34:44,241
You probably heard a mouse.
- I didn't hear nothing. I saw a shadow.

373
00:34:44,823 --> 00:34:46,153
Plenty of shadows down there.

374
00:34:46,531 --> 00:34:48,262
But they stay put.
They don't move around.

375
00:34:49,213 --> 00:34:52,157
With your imagination you could
see the Statue of Liberty do a conga.

376
00:35:02,152 --> 00:35:03,244
Hello Sheriff.

377
00:35:03,609 --> 00:35:05,311
What brings you out
on a night like this?

378
00:35:05,712 --> 00:35:08,471
The phone operator said someone from
here tried to call the state police.

379
00:35:09,073 --> 00:35:10,289
Then the phone went dead.

380
00:35:10,501 --> 00:35:12,203
That's right.
But he won't need them now.

381
00:35:12,528 --> 00:35:13,532
No? Why not?

382
00:35:14,190 --> 00:35:15,700
Because he's like the phone.

383
00:35:16,361 --> 00:35:17,629
Dead.
- Dead?

384
00:35:18,532 --> 00:35:19,992
Died kinda sudden, didn't he?

385
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:21,978
I think he was murdered.

386
00:35:22,382 --> 00:35:23,140
Murdered?

387
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:25,779
And you act like that's
nothing to get excited about?

388
00:35:26,739 --> 00:35:27,755
Where is the body?

389
00:35:28,158 --> 00:35:30,247
We'll have to go upstairs.
- Alright. Lead the way.

390
00:35:30,641 --> 00:35:32,086
Don't any of you leave this room.

391
00:35:50,672 --> 00:35:51,558
There he is.

392
00:35:58,115 --> 00:35:58,902
Who is he?

393
00:35:59,219 --> 00:36:00,268
Tim Winfield.

394
00:36:01,736 --> 00:36:02,608
Tim Winfield?

395
00:36:03,469 --> 00:36:05,057
He is one of the big men of the state.

396
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:08,344
I got to land someone for this murder.

397
00:36:08,907 --> 00:36:11,204
That ought to be easy for
a man of your ability.

398
00:36:12,594 --> 00:36:14,378
Don't you worry about my ability.

399
00:36:16,313 --> 00:36:17,815
What do you know about this murder?

400
00:36:18,172 --> 00:36:19,645
No more than you do at the moment.

401
00:36:20,429 --> 00:36:21,816
I will decide about that later.

402
00:36:22,931 --> 00:36:24,029
Who found the body?

403
00:36:24,591 --> 00:36:25,235
Andy.

404
00:36:25,634 --> 00:36:27,222
He was looking for an escaped convict.

405
00:36:28,888 --> 00:36:29,474
Ha.

406
00:36:29,931 --> 00:36:33,274
You think you can explain this murder by
pulling an imaginary convict from a hat?

407
00:36:34,091 --> 00:36:35,920
I thought you could do better than that.

408
00:36:37,629 --> 00:36:41,243
Let's go downstairs. I want to talk to
Andy before I do any more investigating.

409
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,583
Did you find the body, Andy?
- Uhuh.

410
00:37:05,058 --> 00:37:06,819
You're sure he was dead
when you found him?

411
00:37:07,429 --> 00:37:10,855
He didn't say whether he was or not.
And I didn't stop to ask no questions.

412
00:37:11,822 --> 00:37:14,105
Hey. You ain't thinking maybe I done it?

413
00:37:14,633 --> 00:37:16,536
Never mind what I think.
You answer my question.

414
00:37:16,864 --> 00:37:18,594
I didn't have no reason to kill nobody.

415
00:37:19,108 --> 00:37:20,010
But he did.

416
00:37:20,305 --> 00:37:22,293
To keep himself from being
arrested for kidnapping.

417
00:37:22,591 --> 00:37:24,315
They had a fight right
here in this room.

418
00:37:24,567 --> 00:37:26,555
And I heard him say he
could kill the other fellow.

419
00:37:30,157 --> 00:37:32,073
So, you had a fight
with the corpse, huh?

420
00:37:32,645 --> 00:37:35,446
My father objected to Allen and
I being married. That was all.

421
00:37:35,774 --> 00:37:37,047
Let him answer my question.

422
00:37:37,408 --> 00:37:39,682
And I warn you that whatever you
say can be used against you.

423
00:37:41,134 --> 00:37:42,951
Where were you when the
murder was committed?

424
00:37:43,158 --> 00:37:44,345
Right here in this room.

425
00:37:44,826 --> 00:37:46,666
Who was with you?
- No-one. I was alone.

426
00:37:47,311 --> 00:37:49,668
Well, that's not much of an alibi.

427
00:37:50,742 --> 00:37:54,283
The corpse was calling the state police
to have you arrested for kidnapping.

428
00:37:55,127 --> 00:37:57,256
You cannot beat that for a motive.

429
00:37:58,090 --> 00:38:01,564
I guess we can call this crime
solved without too much trouble.

430
00:38:02,456 --> 00:38:04,375
You're more stupid than usual, Sheriff.

431
00:38:05,253 --> 00:38:06,944
That boy is not a murderer.

432
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:09,842
Maybe you're mixed up in this too.

433
00:38:10,434 --> 00:38:13,789
I've had suspicions about your business
here at the tavern for a long while.

434
00:38:14,381 --> 00:38:16,668
Yes. I noticed that.
It has been very amusing.

435
00:38:17,096 --> 00:38:19,596
Yeah? Well maybe it won't be
so funny one of these days.

436
00:38:21,705 --> 00:38:24,215
You come with me while I
finish looking around upstairs.

437
00:38:24,958 --> 00:38:27,081
You'd better stay here.
- No. I am going with you.

438
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:29,221
Don't stand there and argue. Come on.

439
00:38:35,174 --> 00:38:38,796
It's too bad you weren't born without
a tongue instead of without a brain.

440
00:38:39,347 --> 00:38:40,963
I didn't want him to think I'd done it.

441
00:38:41,188 --> 00:38:44,078
Alright. He does not think
you 'done it'. So get out.

442
00:38:44,798 --> 00:38:45,556
Yes, sir.

443
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:07,848
You're not planning on having John Law
get me out of your way, are you?

444
00:39:09,081 --> 00:39:10,300
You aren't in my way.

445
00:39:11,362 --> 00:39:14,293
But I'm not going to have that boy take
a rap for a murder he did not commit.

446
00:39:15,007 --> 00:39:17,211
Ah, the Raven has turned
soft all of a sudden.

447
00:39:17,974 --> 00:39:19,798
He just wants to get
the kid out of a jam.

448
00:39:20,461 --> 00:39:22,278
He's not a bit interested
in the fifty grand.

449
00:39:23,023 --> 00:39:24,988
Believe it or not that's the way it is.

450
00:39:25,407 --> 00:39:26,450
I don't believe it.

451
00:39:26,657 --> 00:39:29,478
That dough is around here someplace
and nobody elbows me out of the way.

452
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:06,611
I beg your pardon.

453
00:40:07,193 --> 00:40:09,193
What's the idea of pushing
me down the stairs?

454
00:40:22,482 --> 00:40:24,022
I really didn't push you.

455
00:40:25,806 --> 00:40:27,022
Maybe it was an accident.

456
00:40:27,244 --> 00:40:28,427
What you want anyhow?

457
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:31,629
You have the keys to my car.
Will you give them to me please?

458
00:40:32,249 --> 00:40:34,142
Mr Bradford said no-one
is to leave here.

459
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,056
The sheriff has the murderer.

460
00:40:36,263 --> 00:40:38,426
There's no longer any need
for the rest of us to remain.

461
00:40:38,914 --> 00:40:41,968
Mr Bradford says no-one leaves.
No-one leaves until he says different.

462
00:40:42,297 --> 00:40:44,937
I am afraid to stay here. I know
there's going to be more violence.

463
00:40:45,256 --> 00:40:47,122
And my nerves can't
stand that sort of thing.

464
00:40:47,522 --> 00:40:48,620
It's no use arguing.

465
00:40:48,827 --> 00:40:50,357
If I can stand it, you can. Come on.

466
00:40:53,657 --> 00:40:54,758
You'd better confess.

467
00:40:55,001 --> 00:40:57,275
It will save me the trouble of
looking for the murder weapon.

468
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:58,948
And it will be easier on you.

469
00:40:59,155 --> 00:41:00,457
I have nothing to confess.

470
00:41:00,763 --> 00:41:02,938
He couldn't do a thing like that.
You must believe me.

471
00:41:03,257 --> 00:41:05,999
Lady. You've got to cooperate
with the law or keep quiet.

472
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:09,758
If you allowed anyone to cooperate you
may not make such a fool of yourself.

473
00:41:10,309 --> 00:41:11,954
When I want your advice I'll ask for it.

474
00:41:12,246 --> 00:41:14,284
You'll having my advice
whether you want it or not.

475
00:41:14,650 --> 00:41:16,894
You are trying to pin a
murder on the wrong man.

476
00:41:18,021 --> 00:41:20,490
<i>If you're so dead sure he's innocent
then maybe you are guilty.</i>

477
00:41:21,212 --> 00:41:23,117
Maybe I am. You don't know that I'm not.

478
00:41:24,414 --> 00:41:26,021
Are you confessing?
- Certainly not.

479
00:41:26,556 --> 00:41:28,916
I'm merely trying to point out that
you don't know who's guilty.

480
00:41:29,481 --> 00:41:31,298
You're just trying to confuse me.
That's all.

481
00:41:31,648 --> 00:41:32,520
He is guilty.

482
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:34,686
I'll have no trouble to convict him.

483
00:41:36,343 --> 00:41:38,045
Get in there.
You're no better than I am.

484
00:41:40,258 --> 00:41:42,361
Where did Winfield go when he
took that money from you?

485
00:41:42,605 --> 00:41:45,309
I don't know what you're talking about.
- Quit stalling. I heard everything.

486
00:41:45,787 --> 00:41:47,307
Winfield hid that money someplace.

487
00:41:47,595 --> 00:41:49,053
Where did he go?
- I don't know.

488
00:41:50,624 --> 00:41:51,239
Hey.

489
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,329
Did you kill Winfield?

490
00:41:56,655 --> 00:41:58,128
Don't say a thing like that again.

491
00:41:59,461 --> 00:42:00,934
Somebody might think you meant it.

492
00:42:09,305 --> 00:42:11,640
Now, why don't you confess and
take life instead of the chair?

493
00:42:12,253 --> 00:42:14,034
I tell you I have nothing to confess.

494
00:42:14,409 --> 00:42:16,178
You're just being foolish. That's all.

495
00:42:16,613 --> 00:42:17,910
You can't beat this case.

496
00:42:18,396 --> 00:42:20,572
Tim Winfield has got a
lot of important friends.

497
00:42:20,935 --> 00:42:23,295
And they'll make it their business
to see that you're convicted.

498
00:42:25,489 --> 00:42:26,686
Run out. Run!

499
00:42:36,899 --> 00:42:38,238
You've done that on purpose.

500
00:42:38,445 --> 00:42:40,318
I am so sorry.
I hope you didn't hurt yourself.

501
00:42:42,436 --> 00:42:43,180
Darn it.

502
00:43:15,509 --> 00:43:17,739
Of course, in a way I am
sorry he made that break.

503
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:19,906
It makes it look worse for him.

504
00:43:20,113 --> 00:43:21,133
His only chance.

505
00:43:21,479 --> 00:43:24,335
That crooked political bunch would
be only too glad to railroad him.

506
00:43:24,958 --> 00:43:26,202
To get him out of the way.

507
00:43:26,992 --> 00:43:28,180
Yes. That's true enough.

508
00:43:29,434 --> 00:43:30,821
We've got to find the murderer.

509
00:43:31,978 --> 00:43:34,062
You wait in your room until
I see what can be done.

510
00:45:09,326 --> 00:45:10,002
Hey.

511
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:13,281
Stand where you are.
Don't try to make another break.

512
00:45:22,589 --> 00:45:23,932
Stop! Or I'll shoot.

513
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:25,617
[ Gunshot! ]

514
00:46:10,721 --> 00:46:11,801
I heard a shot.

515
00:46:12,609 --> 00:46:13,837
Yes. I thought so too.

516
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:16,844
It must be the thunder.

517
00:46:17,051 --> 00:46:19,993
It wasn't thunder. I was standing by
the window and I saw the gun flash.

518
00:46:20,347 --> 00:46:22,087
I am afraid Allen has been hurt.

519
00:46:22,688 --> 00:46:25,365
Don't you be frightened.
He had plenty of time to get away.

520
00:46:26,297 --> 00:46:28,246
He might have tried to
come back on my account.

521
00:46:28,846 --> 00:46:31,092
Don't worry about something that
will probably never happen.

522
00:46:46,111 --> 00:46:48,614
Why doesn't that copper come downstairs
and go on about his business?

523
00:46:49,463 --> 00:46:50,799
I really don't know.

524
00:46:52,432 --> 00:46:55,157
Maybe The Raven is cooking up something
with him to put the skids under me.

525
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:05,798
Mugs bother me.

526
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:09,143
Maybe one of you knows
where that money is.

527
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:12,738
I'll not give you a chance to scram
with the dough while my back's turned.

528
00:47:12,988 --> 00:47:14,662
I assure you ..
- Never mind about that.

529
00:47:15,028 --> 00:47:17,315
I'll see that you stay put.
Come on, start moving.

530
00:47:27,844 --> 00:47:28,974
Get down those stairs.

531
00:47:29,714 --> 00:47:31,479
I don't like it down there.
- Neither do I.

532
00:47:31,686 --> 00:47:33,752
Who asked what you like? Get down there.

533
00:47:41,216 --> 00:47:42,703
I guess that will hold you.

534
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:52,545
I thought I knew you.

535
00:47:53,061 --> 00:47:55,054
I seen his shadow
creeping along the wall.

536
00:47:55,527 --> 00:47:56,714
What are we going to do?

537
00:47:58,637 --> 00:47:59,710
Fight for our lives.

538
00:49:08,241 --> 00:49:09,342
Where is that copper?

539
00:49:09,606 --> 00:49:11,433
Outside catching cold. I hope.

540
00:49:12,326 --> 00:49:15,055
Maybe the girl here knows something.
She could have been slipped the satchel.

541
00:49:15,262 --> 00:49:16,449
What's he talking about?

542
00:49:16,656 --> 00:49:18,962
He has an idea that someone
has a satchel full of money.

543
00:49:19,265 --> 00:49:20,544
You aren't kidding anyone.

544
00:49:20,843 --> 00:49:23,575
There's 50 grand around here someplace.
- There's also a murder to be solved.

545
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,796
If you don't top talking about that
there's apt to be another one.

546
00:50:50,853 --> 00:50:53,819
Now you're quite satisfied no money
is here, perhaps you'll untie us.

547
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:55,304
It's around here someplace.

548
00:50:55,511 --> 00:50:57,327
You stay right where
you are until I find it.

549
00:50:57,763 --> 00:51:00,270
I have the place to myself now.
I can give it a real going over.

550
00:51:06,391 --> 00:51:08,247
I'm afraid I had
overlooked this possibility.

551
00:51:35,623 --> 00:51:38,908
I haven't heard a sound.
- I doubt there's anyone else down here.

552
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,022
We can't know for sure.

553
00:51:41,584 --> 00:51:42,787
It's all your fault.

554
00:51:42,994 --> 00:51:45,552
If you'd given me the keys to my car
I wouldn't be in this predicament.

555
00:51:46,029 --> 00:51:47,331
You must get me out of here.

556
00:51:47,890 --> 00:51:49,821
I'll find something to
break down the door.

557
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:51,171
Let go of me.

558
00:51:51,394 --> 00:51:53,738
I won't be locked up down
here with a murderer.

559
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:56,137
Shut up or I bust you one.

560
00:51:56,474 --> 00:51:59,324
I must get away from this awful place.
- Look here.

561
00:51:59,897 --> 00:52:02,000
You're better off down here
than you would be up there.

562
00:52:39,057 --> 00:52:40,158
What's going on here?

563
00:52:41,429 --> 00:52:42,978
There is someone hiding over there.

564
00:52:47,239 --> 00:52:48,512
We'll find out who that is.

565
00:52:50,476 --> 00:52:52,234
Come out with your
hands up or I'll shoot.

566
00:53:02,307 --> 00:53:04,513
So you thought you could
escape the gallows, eh?

567
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:07,022
I'll make sure you don't try that again.

568
00:53:07,618 --> 00:53:08,691
Go on, get upstairs.

569
00:53:25,628 --> 00:53:27,381
I'll have you free in a minute.

570
00:54:15,115 --> 00:54:16,622
Did I hurt you?
- No.

571
00:54:29,734 --> 00:54:30,578
[ Gunshot! ]

572
00:54:57,392 --> 00:54:58,847
Where did that shot come from?

573
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:01,026
Did you fire that shot?
- I did not.

574
00:55:01,348 --> 00:55:02,828
Allen. Allen, are you hurt?

575
00:55:03,183 --> 00:55:06,043
No, darling. I wouldn't have been caught
if it hadn't been for those two nitwits.

576
00:55:06,387 --> 00:55:07,803
Andy, you go on about your work.

577
00:55:09,758 --> 00:55:12,637
Mr Bradford, it wasn't my fault.
I was locked down in the basement.

578
00:55:13,139 --> 00:55:14,233
Get out of here.

579
00:55:26,304 --> 00:55:27,832
What's the matter with you?

580
00:55:29,650 --> 00:55:31,009
Have you lost your mind again?

581
00:55:31,692 --> 00:55:33,087
There is a dead man in there.

582
00:55:33,506 --> 00:55:34,321
A dead man?

583
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:55,199
That bullet was meant for me.

584
00:55:56,915 --> 00:55:59,118
That's another murder for you.
Go ahead and solve it.

585
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:01,255
Maybe you can pull
something out of the hat.

586
00:56:02,751 --> 00:56:05,127
I give up. The Sheriff can
handle this to suit himself.

587
00:56:05,714 --> 00:56:07,587
It has stopped raining. I can leave.

588
00:56:07,975 --> 00:56:09,506
Will you give me the keys to my car?

589
00:56:09,868 --> 00:56:11,597
You can have them as
far as I'm concerned.

590
00:56:11,804 --> 00:56:13,897
I'll be happy to see
the last of this place.

591
00:56:14,368 --> 00:56:16,721
You must see the sheriff before you go.
- Yes. I will.

592
00:56:17,209 --> 00:56:19,071
You heard him. Give me my keys.

593
00:56:19,614 --> 00:56:20,437
Alright.

594
00:56:55,492 --> 00:56:56,536
Look here, Sheriff.

595
00:56:56,795 --> 00:57:00,496
Maybe you didn't commit the second
murder but I have got you for the first.

596
00:57:00,848 --> 00:57:02,579
Sheriff, you're making
a terrible mistake.

597
00:57:02,957 --> 00:57:04,149
We will see about that.

598
00:57:38,836 --> 00:57:40,244
Just a minute, Mr Weatherby.

599
00:57:43,493 --> 00:57:44,823
You killed Tim Winfield.

600
00:57:45,489 --> 00:57:47,325
No. That's not true.
I didn't kill anyone.

601
00:57:47,832 --> 00:57:50,405
You're going to run away and let
young Bentley suffer for your crime.

602
00:58:03,060 --> 00:58:05,190
If that's another murder
I'm going screwy.

603
00:58:05,492 --> 00:58:06,536
Move over, Sheriff.

604
00:58:19,136 --> 00:58:21,051
Who fired those shots?
What goes on here?

605
00:58:21,679 --> 00:58:23,496
Here is the man who
killed Winfield, Sheriff.

606
00:58:23,747 --> 00:58:24,362
Him?

607
00:58:24,569 --> 00:58:26,634
I wouldn't suspect he had
the nerve to kill a rabbit.

608
00:58:26,924 --> 00:58:28,884
Just a minute, Sheriff. Let me explain.
- Shut up.

609
00:58:29,650 --> 00:58:31,295
What makes you think he killed Winfield?

610
00:58:31,578 --> 00:58:33,242
The evidence was clear enough.

611
00:58:34,550 --> 00:58:37,092
Although it did take a little
intelligence to unravel it.

612
00:58:38,726 --> 00:58:40,042
Also, he has the money.

613
00:58:41,722 --> 00:58:42,766
The other murderer.

614
00:58:43,140 --> 00:58:43,898
Is there.

615
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:46,519
He was an escaped convict.

616
00:58:47,691 --> 00:58:48,820
Whitey Cole.

617
00:58:49,860 --> 00:58:51,012
Who was after me.

618
00:58:53,566 --> 00:58:54,837
Why did you kill Winfield?

619
00:58:55,982 --> 00:58:57,226
I didn't mean to kill him.

620
00:58:57,841 --> 00:59:00,940
But when he took the money from me it
was just as if he'd torn my heart out.

621
00:59:01,278 --> 00:59:03,786
You see, I'd gambled everything
on that last chance to live.

622
00:59:04,094 --> 00:59:05,653
And without the money it was useless.

623
00:59:06,328 --> 00:59:08,731
As I sat there thinking about
that I got desperate.

624
00:59:09,406 --> 00:59:10,749
I picked up the footstool.

625
00:59:11,387 --> 00:59:14,354
And followed him into a room where
he'd gone to hide the money. I hit him.

626
00:59:15,314 --> 00:59:16,604
As hard as I could.

627
00:59:17,182 --> 00:59:19,609
I wanted to hurt him but I
didn't think it would kill him.

628
00:59:20,285 --> 00:59:22,709
And then I threw the
satchel out the window.

629
00:59:23,320 --> 00:59:25,254
Planning on picking it up when I could.

630
00:59:35,725 --> 00:59:37,133
Mr Bradford, you're hurt.

631
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:40,225
I guess Whitey has paid off.

632
00:59:42,769 --> 00:59:43,928
I hope you will both ..

633
01:00:36,946 --> 01:00:37,647
..f-s..
