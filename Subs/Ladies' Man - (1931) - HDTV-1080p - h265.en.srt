1
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:26,534
So nice of you to let me drop
you at your hotel, Mr Darricott.

2
00:01:27,135 --> 00:01:30,318
Of course it's wretched for that exhibit
to be held so near the Metropole.

3
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:33,001
Or we could have had a longer talk.

4
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,206
I am told that mountains
can be moved by faith.

5
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:39,665
But I'm afraid that nothing can be
done about moving The Metropole.

6
00:01:40,997 --> 00:01:43,271
However, I console myself.
We meet again in two hours.

7
00:01:43,643 --> 00:01:47,094
I'm so glad you were able to arrange
your engagements so you could come.

8
00:01:47,428 --> 00:01:49,066
We dine early: 7:30.

9
00:01:49,494 --> 00:01:52,212
After all, we must hear
something of the opera.

10
00:01:52,531 --> 00:01:53,342
Ah, yes.

11
00:01:53,878 --> 00:01:57,447
It might be interesting sometime to find
out if Tosca really had a first act.

12
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,864
Good afternoon, Mr Darricott.
- Charles.

13
00:02:09,585 --> 00:02:11,223
Until tonight?
- Until tonight.

14
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:26,113
"Calling Mr Mellner. 714."

15
00:02:27,379 --> 00:02:28,407
"Mr Mellner."

16
00:02:32,627 --> 00:02:33,904
Here you are, Mr Darricott.

17
00:02:48,719 --> 00:02:50,334
Thank you, Mr Darricott.

18
00:02:51,672 --> 00:02:52,945
Here you are, Mr Darricott.

19
00:02:53,539 --> 00:02:55,041
What a marvelous day, Mr Darricott.

20
00:03:00,544 --> 00:03:04,045
You wouldn't think a fellow could run
up a bill of $28 on 3-cent newspapers.

21
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,022
Would you?

22
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:08,112
Why not? He ran up $40 on
me on 20-cent cigarettes.

23
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:09,744
You ain't worried, are you?

24
00:03:09,969 --> 00:03:12,614
No. There's no chance in the world
of that fellow not coming through.

25
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:13,745
You said it.

26
00:03:14,016 --> 00:03:15,661
They don't make them any nicer than him.

27
00:03:15,952 --> 00:03:17,446
A real swell, is what I mean.

28
00:03:22,637 --> 00:03:24,625
Thank you, Fred.
- Always a pleasure, Mr Darricott.

29
00:03:45,212 --> 00:03:45,913
Eugene.

30
00:03:49,069 --> 00:03:50,216
How do I stand today?

31
00:03:50,726 --> 00:03:53,151
Sorry, Mr Darricott.
You just dropped three million.

32
00:03:54,217 --> 00:03:55,776
Three million, huh?
- Three million.

33
00:03:57,911 --> 00:04:00,246
I'm afraid I haven't the cash
on hand to reimburse you.

34
00:04:01,286 --> 00:04:03,879
Shall we call it square if I let
you read the sporting page first?

35
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,331
Anything you say, Mr Darricott.

36
00:04:07,155 --> 00:04:09,331
I took the other dress
shirt to the laundry.

37
00:04:10,238 --> 00:04:11,294
Thanks, Eugene.

38
00:04:12,429 --> 00:04:14,217
Nice of you to go to so
much trouble for me.

39
00:04:14,942 --> 00:04:17,904
I'd rather do a little valet
service for you for nothing.

40
00:04:18,752 --> 00:04:19,629
Nothing?

41
00:04:20,095 --> 00:04:23,085
Than for some of those guys
who give me 20-dollar tips.

42
00:04:24,024 --> 00:04:26,507
It's not everyone who can have an
address like the Hotel Metropole.

43
00:04:26,695 --> 00:04:28,682
And valet service for
ten dollars a week.

44
00:04:31,162 --> 00:04:33,669
We know a gentleman when
we see one, Mr Darricott.

45
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:36,074
Stop Eugene. You turn my head.

46
00:04:36,408 --> 00:04:38,339
Shall I lay out the evening
clothes for you, sir?

47
00:04:40,115 --> 00:04:40,730
Yes.

48
00:04:42,566 --> 00:04:44,068
In the meantime, I'll draw my bath.

49
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:46,451
That is, unless someone
is using it at the moment.

50
00:04:54,869 --> 00:04:56,706
So nice of you to dine
with us, Mr Darricott.

51
00:04:56,894 --> 00:04:58,884
I know how rushed you must be.
- Rushed?

52
00:04:59,361 --> 00:05:02,092
I should think an attractive bachelor
in New York would be stampeded.

53
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:05,516
How does one avoid being trampled
in the jam, Mr Darricott?

54
00:05:06,206 --> 00:05:08,040
I am afraid I cannot
give expert testimony.

55
00:05:09,016 --> 00:05:10,425
I'm just an innocent bystander.

56
00:05:10,866 --> 00:05:12,159
Innocent bystander?

57
00:05:13,077 --> 00:05:15,533
Isn't that the fellow who always
gets shot by accident?

58
00:05:16,058 --> 00:05:17,109
Why, Peyton.

59
00:05:17,448 --> 00:05:19,957
Don't you ever got shot by
accident, Mr Darricott?

60
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:22,168
It is so unromantic.

61
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,900
Perhaps you could suggest a romantic
way for Mr Darricott to get shot?

62
00:05:27,139 --> 00:05:30,212
Well. In a pinch I might
shoot him myself.

63
00:05:30,657 --> 00:05:32,502
It would be a pleasure
to be a target for you.

64
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,602
I'd tremble. So I'd probably miss you.

65
00:05:35,562 --> 00:05:36,206
Well.

66
00:05:37,224 --> 00:05:40,110
If you're not going to shoot
Mr Darricott at this very moment ..

67
00:05:40,504 --> 00:05:44,420
It might be fun to see if we can get to
the Robinsons on time just this once.

68
00:05:46,953 --> 00:05:48,340
You'd better hurry too, mother.

69
00:05:48,528 --> 00:05:50,340
You're more than
fashionably late right now.

70
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:54,642
If we could ever get your father to stop
imitating a caged lion, we can leave.

71
00:05:55,393 --> 00:05:56,494
Horace.
- Yes, dear?

72
00:05:56,765 --> 00:05:58,353
Mr Helden and Mr Dorset are here, sir.

73
00:05:58,593 --> 00:05:59,389
Oh yes.

74
00:05:59,795 --> 00:06:02,138
I am sorry, dear. I had hoped
these fellows wouldn't turn up.

75
00:06:03,088 --> 00:06:06,535
Tony, it looks as if you and I must tear
ourselves away from this nice gathering.

76
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:08,639
They're here about the Austrian loan.

77
00:06:08,827 --> 00:06:09,928
Horace.
- Yes, dear?

78
00:06:10,373 --> 00:06:14,037
I suppose this means you're not going
to the opera with me again. Is that it?

79
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:15,382
Afraid so.

80
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:17,488
The second time this week
you disappoint me.

81
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:19,457
When I had my heart set on the opera.

82
00:06:19,797 --> 00:06:21,051
Horace.
- I am sorry.

83
00:06:21,385 --> 00:06:23,196
What good does it do
me for you to be sorry?

84
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:26,008
Night after night if I want to go
anyplace I have to go without you.

85
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:28,412
It's humiliating.
- Look here, my dear.

86
00:06:28,684 --> 00:06:31,358
It's not as if I didn't want to go.
- I do not believe you.

87
00:06:31,865 --> 00:06:35,005
Well. If we could perhaps
discuss this at another time.

88
00:06:35,321 --> 00:06:37,224
But it's always some other time.

89
00:06:37,562 --> 00:06:38,526
I'm sick of it.

90
00:06:38,819 --> 00:06:41,036
I want to go to the opera and
I want to go with my husband.

91
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:42,559
You've no right ..
- Mother.

92
00:06:42,747 --> 00:06:46,136
And you. Why must you go to those stupid
business meetings with your father?

93
00:06:46,423 --> 00:06:48,206
If Tony has to go into my bank ..

94
00:06:48,394 --> 00:06:51,935
I don't quite see how he will get along
if he doesn't know something of my work.

95
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,255
Now, goodnight.

96
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,091
Run along, son.
- Goodnight.

97
00:06:56,450 --> 00:06:57,237
Goodnight.

98
00:06:58,212 --> 00:07:01,261
There's one thing you must admit
about our family, Mr Darricott.

99
00:07:01,588 --> 00:07:03,213
Never a dull moment.

100
00:07:05,579 --> 00:07:07,239
Well, if you will excuse me.

101
00:07:07,582 --> 00:07:10,034
Oh, Mr Darricott.
You won't disappoint me, will you?

102
00:07:10,381 --> 00:07:12,298
I've had my heart set on
tonight's performance.

103
00:07:12,557 --> 00:07:14,782
You will like it, you know.
- I shall be delighted.

104
00:07:15,152 --> 00:07:17,868
If Peyton and I didn't have this
engagement we simply must keep ..

105
00:07:18,232 --> 00:07:20,642
I wouldn't think of making you
change your plans, darling.

106
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,518
We have to get to the Robinsons.
- Alright. Alright.

107
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:25,757
Have a good time, Mr Darricott.

108
00:07:26,245 --> 00:07:27,261
Goodnight, mother.

109
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:28,525
Goodnight.

110
00:07:35,782 --> 00:07:38,092
It seemed as if you weren't
going to have any choice.

111
00:07:39,187 --> 00:07:40,062
Any choice?

112
00:07:40,575 --> 00:07:42,515
Well, the way things have turned out.

113
00:07:43,622 --> 00:07:46,208
I'm afraid you're going to
have me on your hands ..

114
00:07:46,952 --> 00:07:47,796
For tonight.

115
00:07:48,917 --> 00:07:49,724
At least.

116
00:07:52,422 --> 00:07:53,552
I shall be very happy.

117
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,469
I'll get my wrap.

118
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,393
Lovely, isn't it?

119
00:08:34,567 --> 00:08:35,467
Ah yes.

120
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,022
One of my favorite subjects.

121
00:08:38,980 --> 00:08:39,768
Potemkin?

122
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,729
Catherine and Potemkin.

123
00:08:43,497 --> 00:08:44,083
Oh.

124
00:08:44,953 --> 00:08:45,825
A lucky chap.

125
00:08:46,684 --> 00:08:48,267
That he found his Catherine.

126
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,908
Almost too late.

127
00:08:50,385 --> 00:08:52,798
It would have been rather
tragic for her too, wouldn't it?

128
00:08:53,312 --> 00:08:55,243
If she had not found him.

129
00:08:55,919 --> 00:08:56,711
I wonder.

130
00:08:57,734 --> 00:08:59,293
She made him a great man, didn't she?

131
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:00,928
He made her a happy woman.

132
00:09:02,106 --> 00:09:03,635
And what better can any man ask for?

133
00:09:04,693 --> 00:09:06,275
If he finds his Catherine.

134
00:09:07,158 --> 00:09:08,393
But a woman can ..

135
00:09:10,145 --> 00:09:12,493
But Catherine did find her Potemkin.

136
00:09:15,277 --> 00:09:16,293
But he had to die.

137
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:19,222
Does Potemkin always have to die?

138
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,063
What a dreadful fate.

139
00:09:23,786 --> 00:09:24,916
What a glorious death.

140
00:09:28,478 --> 00:09:29,322
Shall we go?

141
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,184
To the ..

142
00:09:33,098 --> 00:09:33,770
Opera?

143
00:09:36,906 --> 00:09:37,778
To the opera.

144
00:09:43,515 --> 00:09:45,486
You are not very
complimentary, Mr Darricott.

145
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:49,730
I am with you and yet it seems
as though you are alone.

146
00:09:53,716 --> 00:09:54,870
I am always alone.

147
00:09:58,097 --> 00:10:01,256
If you could only know what an evening
like this can mean to a man like me.

148
00:10:02,602 --> 00:10:03,306
A home.

149
00:10:03,855 --> 00:10:04,718
A fireside.

150
00:10:05,338 --> 00:10:06,325
A charming woman.

151
00:10:07,176 --> 00:10:08,717
What good are all those things ..

152
00:10:09,905 --> 00:10:11,137
Where there is no love?

153
00:10:13,192 --> 00:10:14,436
But where there is love ..

154
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:19,381
I want so badly to talk to you Jamie.

155
00:10:21,728 --> 00:10:23,604
Almost too late for the opera.

156
00:10:25,125 --> 00:10:26,234
It is too late.

157
00:10:26,924 --> 00:10:28,783
It all seems so unimportant.

158
00:10:29,498 --> 00:10:31,675
The opera. Tosca. All those people.

159
00:10:32,689 --> 00:10:34,338
If only we could sit and talk.

160
00:10:36,796 --> 00:10:38,307
Perhaps if we could go to your ..

161
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:40,410
Well.

162
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:42,476
Perhaps at The Metropole ..?

163
00:10:44,463 --> 00:10:45,477
Well, if I ..

164
00:10:47,134 --> 00:10:48,454
If I had only known. But ..

165
00:10:48,772 --> 00:10:50,181
Unfortunately, my ..

166
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,548
My rooms are not my
own for this evening.

167
00:10:53,757 --> 00:10:54,751
An old friend.

168
00:10:55,836 --> 00:10:57,854
I know a place where we can be alone.

169
00:11:01,389 --> 00:11:03,203
And that's why I am so unhappy, Jamie.

170
00:11:07,996 --> 00:11:09,054
I am so sorry.

171
00:11:11,641 --> 00:11:13,635
If I could believe you
really meant that.

172
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:16,981
Please believe it.

173
00:11:17,825 --> 00:11:18,756
Please mean it.

174
00:11:20,609 --> 00:11:21,555
I mean it.

175
00:11:22,845 --> 00:11:23,861
Then I believe it.

176
00:11:25,173 --> 00:11:26,821
How lucky I am.

177
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:29,212
Lucky?

178
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:31,231
Lucky to have met you.

179
00:11:32,635 --> 00:11:34,508
I have a husband whose
life is not my life.

180
00:11:35,202 --> 00:11:36,933
I have children whose
lives are their own.

181
00:11:37,358 --> 00:11:38,402
They don't need me.

182
00:11:40,175 --> 00:11:41,009
I need ..

183
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:43,624
Someone.

184
00:11:44,967 --> 00:11:46,488
I had nothing at all until ..

185
00:11:49,392 --> 00:11:50,241
Until?

186
00:11:51,114 --> 00:11:52,460
Until I met you.

187
00:11:54,347 --> 00:11:55,405
And now ..

188
00:12:09,879 --> 00:12:11,181
Five thousand, Mr Darricott?

189
00:12:12,667 --> 00:12:14,085
Six.
- That's a lot of money.

190
00:12:15,145 --> 00:12:16,304
It's a lot of bracelet.

191
00:12:17,013 --> 00:12:18,070
Okay, Mr Darricott.

192
00:12:18,524 --> 00:12:20,026
I will mail you the check as usual.

193
00:12:20,313 --> 00:12:22,235
Thank you. Good day.
- Good day, sir.

194
00:12:22,761 --> 00:12:23,588
Thank you.

195
00:12:33,657 --> 00:12:35,640
Let's take a look at
those bracelets, Fred.

196
00:12:35,953 --> 00:12:37,925
Alright. But you don't have
to worry about them.

197
00:12:38,244 --> 00:12:39,574
He didn't have to steal them.

198
00:12:40,564 --> 00:12:42,669
That dame is only too glad
to give them to him.

199
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:43,959
What dame?

200
00:12:44,147 --> 00:12:47,034
Say, I had this out with
headquarters six months ago.

201
00:12:47,473 --> 00:12:49,236
The first time he brought anything in.

202
00:12:50,102 --> 00:12:53,354
Mr Horace Fendley might not know
that these things are missing.

203
00:12:53,777 --> 00:12:55,138
But Mrs Fendley does.

204
00:12:56,288 --> 00:12:59,212
You'll never get a report on
them as stolen property.

205
00:13:00,752 --> 00:13:01,560
Okay.

206
00:13:02,521 --> 00:13:06,597
Gadgets like these convert into cash
with much less trouble than a check.

207
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,442
You have to sign your name on
the back of a check, you know.

208
00:13:24,700 --> 00:13:25,935
I'm sorry, Mr Darricott.

209
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,794
Mrs Fendley left her home an hour ago.

210
00:13:28,093 --> 00:13:29,595
Her maid said there was no message.

211
00:13:31,571 --> 00:13:32,730
Thank you.
- Yes, sir.

212
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,296
And a demitasse?

213
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:38,362
Well, I think we'd better wait, Victor.

214
00:13:38,607 --> 00:13:39,527
Hello Jamie.

215
00:13:45,318 --> 00:13:45,962
Well.

216
00:13:47,404 --> 00:13:48,076
Hello.

217
00:13:48,652 --> 00:13:49,869
Surprised to see me?

218
00:13:51,036 --> 00:13:51,651
Yes.

219
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:52,998
And no.

220
00:13:53,358 --> 00:13:55,375
There's a simple explanation
if you care to hear it.

221
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,854
Auntie Mabel decided an hour ago
to enjoy very, very bad health.

222
00:13:59,297 --> 00:14:01,486
So mother had to drive out
to Long Island to see her.

223
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:05,084
She asked me to phone you and say she
couldn't keep her engagement with you.

224
00:14:05,793 --> 00:14:06,945
But somehow I forgot.

225
00:14:07,827 --> 00:14:09,820
But you remembered to keep
her engagement for her?

226
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,824
As a matter of fact, mother
thought it would be a good idea.

227
00:14:13,476 --> 00:14:14,205
That is.

228
00:14:14,393 --> 00:14:17,660
I'm sure she would have thought it
a good idea if she had thought of it.

229
00:14:18,327 --> 00:14:19,972
Funny. I was about to suggest it myself.

230
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:21,053
You liar.

231
00:14:21,661 --> 00:14:24,537
What you really mean is you're afraid
you've a wasted evening on your hands.

232
00:14:25,068 --> 00:14:27,323
An evening can never be
called wasted until it's over.

233
00:14:28,485 --> 00:14:30,914
I went to a lot of pains
to dress the part, Jamie.

234
00:14:31,234 --> 00:14:33,110
You won't have to be very ashamed of me.

235
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:37,529
'Banker's daughter takes world altitude
record reaching for compliments'.

236
00:14:37,913 --> 00:14:39,842
Banker's daughter has
just that intention.

237
00:14:40,174 --> 00:14:42,577
I'm ashamed of you, my dear Rachel.
You are positively ..

238
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:43,720
Beautiful?

239
00:14:44,126 --> 00:14:45,199
Beautiful of course.

240
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:47,849
But the word I mean
should also convey ..

241
00:14:48,346 --> 00:14:49,161
Brilliance?

242
00:14:49,674 --> 00:14:50,432
Radiance?

243
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:54,459
I am sure you know the word I mean.
You're just too modest to use it.

244
00:14:55,525 --> 00:14:57,031
When you call me modest.

245
00:14:57,613 --> 00:14:58,289
Smile.

246
00:14:59,077 --> 00:15:01,540
To call you modest, my dear,
takes more than a smile.

247
00:15:02,728 --> 00:15:03,777
Have it your way.

248
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:04,826
Well.

249
00:15:05,268 --> 00:15:06,954
Do we dine or do we dine?

250
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:09,864
We dine.

251
00:15:15,123 --> 00:15:17,017
We'll be two for dinner after all.

252
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:19,749
Yes, sir. I have the table ready, sir.

253
00:15:21,192 --> 00:15:21,979
Thank you.

254
00:15:22,864 --> 00:15:24,895
Forgive me if I seem too bold.

255
00:15:25,262 --> 00:15:28,869
But dinner and the theater will be just
the hors d'oeuvres of the evening?

256
00:15:30,111 --> 00:15:32,295
And if I might make one more suggestion.

257
00:15:33,109 --> 00:15:36,608
Don't you think it's a good idea if we
kept the rest of the menu to ourselves?

258
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,705
You mean ..

259
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:41,987
Not to tell ..
- Bright child.

260
00:15:43,592 --> 00:15:45,250
And now, Mr Jamie Darricott.

261
00:15:46,189 --> 00:15:50,290
Suppose I tell you I've looked forward
to substituting for mother for months?

262
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:53,534
And suppose I tell you ..
- What?

263
00:15:55,017 --> 00:15:56,396
That you are a funny kid.

264
00:15:56,891 --> 00:15:59,125
You'll change your mind about that too.

265
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,238
There you are, Charles.
- Thank you, Mr Darricott.

266
00:16:38,794 --> 00:16:39,677
Mr Darricott.

267
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:41,981
Your cigarettes got in
today from Cairo, sir.

268
00:16:42,593 --> 00:16:45,071
Oh? Send them up Charlie, will you?
- Yes, I will. Thank you, sir.

269
00:16:45,785 --> 00:16:47,058
Good morning, Mr Darricott.

270
00:17:12,951 --> 00:17:14,096
Good afternoon, sir.

271
00:17:14,918 --> 00:17:15,619
Eugene.

272
00:17:17,452 --> 00:17:19,405
Miss Rachel has been
waiting for you, sir.

273
00:17:20,484 --> 00:17:21,728
She is in the living room.

274
00:17:23,808 --> 00:17:24,728
Thank you.

275
00:17:32,619 --> 00:17:33,974
Hello.
- Well.

276
00:17:35,028 --> 00:17:35,700
Hello.

277
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,106
Well, aren't you glad to see me?

278
00:17:42,084 --> 00:17:42,821
Always.

279
00:17:44,516 --> 00:17:45,752
For the twentieth time ..

280
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,775
I take the liberty of reminding you that
it's very unwise of you to come here.

281
00:17:49,345 --> 00:17:52,164
Meaning for the twentieth time that
mother won't like it if she found out?

282
00:17:52,618 --> 00:17:55,363
You have an uncanny ability
to divine just what I mean.

283
00:17:56,631 --> 00:18:00,498
As a matter of fact Mr Darricott, I came
to deliver a message, as you asked me.

284
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,817
Particularly if mother asks you.

285
00:18:03,578 --> 00:18:05,126
My party is not until ten.

286
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:08,341
But mother and I thought it would be
very sweet if you could come at nine.

287
00:18:09,007 --> 00:18:11,079
And help us with whatever
pops up at the last minute.

288
00:18:14,092 --> 00:18:15,669
I shall be delighted.
- Thank you.

289
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:18,632
But that's not what you
came here to tell me.

290
00:18:25,204 --> 00:18:27,542
I did have something else I
wanted to talk to you about.

291
00:18:28,330 --> 00:18:28,916
Ah.

292
00:18:29,401 --> 00:18:30,143
Mother.

293
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,091
You and she are being talked about.

294
00:18:33,624 --> 00:18:35,227
Everyone knows but dad.

295
00:18:35,909 --> 00:18:37,239
You've become a town scandal.

296
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:43,965
It's an idle world, Rachel.

297
00:18:45,324 --> 00:18:47,635
Hundreds of people with nothing
to occupy their time except ..

298
00:18:51,676 --> 00:18:53,554
That still isn't what you
came here to tell me.

299
00:18:55,558 --> 00:18:56,375
What is it?

300
00:18:56,972 --> 00:18:58,057
It's you, Jamie.

301
00:18:58,583 --> 00:18:59,541
It is you and I.

302
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:03,920
It's been nearly four months since
we began seeing a lot of each other.

303
00:19:04,737 --> 00:19:05,463
I know.

304
00:19:05,651 --> 00:19:07,539
I cannot keep on any longer this way.

305
00:19:08,325 --> 00:19:11,020
It's not easy for me, Rachel.
- We've got to stop being furtive.

306
00:19:14,082 --> 00:19:16,179
A strange girl.
- In what way am I strange?

307
00:19:17,012 --> 00:19:18,536
Is it strange to fall in love?

308
00:19:18,899 --> 00:19:20,029
To want what you love?

309
00:19:21,256 --> 00:19:21,985
My dear.

310
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:24,431
I couldn't let you in for ..

311
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:26,533
This.
- There's no need for this.

312
00:19:28,271 --> 00:19:29,824
We could get married, you and I.

313
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:32,614
Why not? I have my own money.

314
00:19:32,989 --> 00:19:35,178
I will come into almost three
million on my next birthday.

315
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,218
Oh.

316
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:39,160
I didn't mean to talk about that.
- That's alright.

317
00:19:40,313 --> 00:19:42,292
You are privileged to talk
about money to me.

318
00:19:43,001 --> 00:19:43,691
Jamie.

319
00:19:44,259 --> 00:19:46,240
Why shouldn't we announce
our engagement tonight?

320
00:19:50,963 --> 00:19:52,382
That's impossible.
- Why?

321
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,227
I see.

322
00:20:05,964 --> 00:20:07,555
Jamie, you've got to break with this.

323
00:20:07,962 --> 00:20:08,577
Hmm.

324
00:20:09,352 --> 00:20:10,482
That is not so simple.

325
00:20:10,787 --> 00:20:12,577
If you loved me as I love you.

326
00:20:12,980 --> 00:20:14,339
You would find it very simple.

327
00:20:15,513 --> 00:20:17,892
How do you suppose I feel
when I see you with mother?

328
00:20:18,718 --> 00:20:21,077
How do you suppose I'll feel
tonight at my own party?

329
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:23,664
What do you think it will mean to me ..

330
00:20:23,852 --> 00:20:26,732
When I see you lead the Grand March
with her on Friday night?

331
00:20:32,577 --> 00:20:33,364
Catherine.

332
00:20:33,967 --> 00:20:35,244
And her Potemkin.

333
00:20:40,881 --> 00:20:41,707
Rachel.

334
00:20:46,093 --> 00:20:47,166
You must be patient.

335
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:50,046
Please.

336
00:20:51,356 --> 00:20:52,675
Kiss me, Jamie.

337
00:21:04,456 --> 00:21:05,414
You must go now.

338
00:21:06,376 --> 00:21:09,523
I suppose I have got to start
learning to obey you sometime.

339
00:21:13,745 --> 00:21:14,474
Goodbye.

340
00:21:17,015 --> 00:21:17,744
Goodbye.

341
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,001
Pardon me, sir.

342
00:21:45,399 --> 00:21:46,615
It is 12 o'clock.

343
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,825
It's what?
It's 12 o'clock, sir.

344
00:21:51,905 --> 00:21:53,075
Miss Fendley's party.

345
00:21:56,568 --> 00:21:57,269
Oh yes.

346
00:22:03,744 --> 00:22:05,303
I can't imagine what happened to him.

347
00:22:05,522 --> 00:22:07,135
What could happen to Jamie Darricott?

348
00:22:07,542 --> 00:22:10,811
If you knew the number of women who try
to trap him into going to their parties.

349
00:22:11,161 --> 00:22:13,603
If you had any idea ..
- It's such a lovely party.

350
00:22:13,894 --> 00:22:15,860
What difference does it
make if he comes or not?

351
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:17,146
A lot of difference.

352
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:19,980
It's my party and he might have had
the common courtesy to be here.

353
00:22:20,279 --> 00:22:21,592
Oh, Rachel dear.

354
00:22:22,124 --> 00:22:23,453
What difference does it make?

355
00:22:23,887 --> 00:22:25,675
Whether he's courteous to you or not?

356
00:22:26,256 --> 00:22:28,187
It's time you left Jamie
Darricott alone, mother.

357
00:22:28,735 --> 00:22:30,763
If he's interested in any one Fendley ..
- Rachel.

358
00:22:31,091 --> 00:22:33,326
It's the truth.
You've fooled yourself long enough.

359
00:22:33,725 --> 00:22:36,397
You don't really think Jamie Darricott
is coming here to see you?

360
00:22:36,696 --> 00:22:37,815
Elaine, dear.

361
00:22:38,132 --> 00:22:39,573
It was so lovely.

362
00:22:39,845 --> 00:22:41,500
Therese, you're not going?
- Yes.

363
00:22:41,788 --> 00:22:43,090
We really must, Mrs Fendley.

364
00:22:43,703 --> 00:22:45,725
I hate to, but I'm leaving
for home tomorrow and ..

365
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:48,284
When I was your age I never
thought of going to bed ..

366
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:51,364
Until the others thought of getting up.
- I have so much to do tomorrow morning.

367
00:22:51,744 --> 00:22:53,825
Now that you've met us you
must come and see us often.

368
00:22:54,163 --> 00:22:55,035
Thank you.

369
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,123
Say goodnight to Mr Fendley for me.
- Yes. Indeed I will.

370
00:23:06,441 --> 00:23:07,166
Gaston.

371
00:23:07,615 --> 00:23:08,695
You had better wait.

372
00:23:09,229 --> 00:23:10,218
I shan't be long.

373
00:23:12,018 --> 00:23:13,359
How do you do, Mrs Blanton.

374
00:23:30,623 --> 00:23:32,457
Aunt Theresa. Who is that man?

375
00:23:33,209 --> 00:23:34,786
Are you trying to be funny, Norma?

376
00:23:35,213 --> 00:23:36,126
No. Who is he?

377
00:23:36,838 --> 00:23:38,094
That is Jamie Darricott.

378
00:23:38,534 --> 00:23:39,887
This year's ladies' man.

379
00:23:41,585 --> 00:23:43,327
Ladies' man?
- Ladies' man.

380
00:23:44,239 --> 00:23:47,210
And at the moment 'the ladies'
happen to be Mrs Fendley.

381
00:23:49,231 --> 00:23:50,590
Goodnight, dear.
- Goodnight.

382
00:23:51,216 --> 00:23:52,088
Yes, Anthony?

383
00:23:52,437 --> 00:23:54,325
Mr James Darricott has just come in.

384
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,179
Jamie? Why, I must ..
- One moment, mother.

385
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,074
If he's to join this party I'm leaving.

386
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:03,082
You are being a silly boy, Anthony.

387
00:24:03,389 --> 00:24:05,148
I am not silly.
He is cheap and disgusting.

388
00:24:05,336 --> 00:24:06,926
Don't talk like that about a friend.

389
00:24:07,203 --> 00:24:09,100
He's not a friend.
Do you know what they say?

390
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:10,110
Anthony.

391
00:24:10,461 --> 00:24:12,451
I must forbid you to
speak that way to me.

392
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:14,003
As you wish.

393
00:24:14,868 --> 00:24:16,361
But if he stays, I go.

394
00:24:17,738 --> 00:24:20,746
You are always to do
whatever suits you, Anthony.

395
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,471
Goodnight, mother.
- Goodnight, dear.

396
00:24:30,175 --> 00:24:30,906
Jamie.

397
00:24:33,049 --> 00:24:33,944
Jamie.

398
00:24:37,493 --> 00:24:38,605
Where have you been?

399
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:40,350
Where have I not been?

400
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:42,374
I asked you to be here at nine.

401
00:24:42,818 --> 00:24:43,926
You did, my dear.

402
00:24:44,419 --> 00:24:46,646
Do you I'll put up with
your insults much longer?

403
00:24:47,933 --> 00:24:48,964
How do you do.

404
00:24:49,567 --> 00:24:52,521
Would I be insulting you if I asked you
to be good enough to lower your voice?

405
00:24:52,821 --> 00:24:54,094
You are doing it perfectly.

406
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,756
You are trying to humiliate me.

407
00:24:57,454 --> 00:24:58,478
Who is she?

408
00:24:59,562 --> 00:25:00,694
Thank you, no.

409
00:25:10,665 --> 00:25:11,309
Well.

410
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,986
Our dÃ©butante child.

411
00:25:15,086 --> 00:25:16,073
My felicitations.

412
00:25:16,824 --> 00:25:18,857
Thank you. Aren't you just a bit late?

413
00:25:19,286 --> 00:25:20,570
Oh .. a bit.

414
00:25:21,036 --> 00:25:22,595
I've been waiting for you since nine.

415
00:25:22,874 --> 00:25:25,199
If you think I am going to forgive
you, you're badly mistaken.

416
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,774
You'll forgive me.

417
00:25:29,632 --> 00:25:30,805
I am afraid I shall.

418
00:25:32,205 --> 00:25:34,450
That's what makes me more
furious than anything else.

419
00:25:39,641 --> 00:25:40,345
Well.

420
00:25:41,579 --> 00:25:42,822
Now for our charming host.

421
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:45,246
No. You can stay and
talk to me for a moment.

422
00:25:48,683 --> 00:25:50,448
Jamie.
- My dear Elaine.

423
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:53,254
If you must know, I am sorry I was late.

424
00:25:53,563 --> 00:25:55,860
And you know I didn't
mean anything I said.

425
00:25:57,363 --> 00:25:58,464
I suppose you didn't.

426
00:25:59,886 --> 00:26:00,787
But sometimes.

427
00:26:02,549 --> 00:26:03,409
Sometimes ..

428
00:26:04,693 --> 00:26:05,537
What, Jamie?

429
00:26:09,356 --> 00:26:10,085
Nothing.

430
00:26:11,606 --> 00:26:12,536
Nothing at all.

431
00:26:18,865 --> 00:26:19,709
How are you?

432
00:26:51,422 --> 00:26:52,263
Thank you.

433
00:26:53,747 --> 00:26:54,820
Well, how do you do?

434
00:26:56,627 --> 00:26:57,910
We have met before.

435
00:26:58,904 --> 00:26:59,643
Have we?

436
00:27:00,109 --> 00:27:00,810
Oh yes.

437
00:27:01,218 --> 00:27:04,262
Last night as you were leaving the
Fendleys with Mrs Blanton. Remember?

438
00:27:05,150 --> 00:27:06,114
I see.

439
00:27:06,787 --> 00:27:10,425
Yes. I suppose to a 'ladies' man' that
does constitute an introduction.

440
00:27:12,325 --> 00:27:13,398
Then you do know me.

441
00:27:15,823 --> 00:27:16,477
You.

442
00:27:17,272 --> 00:27:18,831
You don't live here in New York, huh?

443
00:27:19,957 --> 00:27:21,144
What makes you think so?

444
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:23,168
I think I should have known.

445
00:27:25,561 --> 00:27:27,162
Remaining here for some time?

446
00:27:28,594 --> 00:27:29,695
I am leaving tonight.

447
00:27:29,993 --> 00:27:30,861
For my home.

448
00:27:31,589 --> 00:27:32,266
Why?

449
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:34,845
Surely you don't want to leave New York?

450
00:27:35,615 --> 00:27:36,635
I've got to.

451
00:27:37,136 --> 00:27:37,878
Got to?

452
00:27:39,005 --> 00:27:40,064
That is slave talk.

453
00:27:40,671 --> 00:27:42,287
You ought to be doing what you want to.

454
00:27:42,593 --> 00:27:43,731
While you can want to.

455
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,589
I generally do.

456
00:27:49,413 --> 00:27:51,702
I'm the little man who can
show you all this big city.

457
00:27:53,323 --> 00:27:54,253
Do you know ..

458
00:27:54,548 --> 00:27:56,765
That's one of the few things
that I can take your word for.

459
00:27:59,303 --> 00:28:00,547
But I am taking the train.

460
00:28:02,163 --> 00:28:03,436
Do you know they tell me ..

461
00:28:03,955 --> 00:28:05,886
That they have a train
nearly every day now.

462
00:28:07,484 --> 00:28:09,387
I could show you a lot
of this town in 24 hours.

463
00:28:09,822 --> 00:28:10,551
Somehow.

464
00:28:10,923 --> 00:28:13,295
I think your New York and
my New York are different.

465
00:28:14,251 --> 00:28:15,324
Suppose we find out?

466
00:28:16,002 --> 00:28:17,291
Let's make the grand tour.

467
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:18,906
See the clock around.

468
00:28:19,670 --> 00:28:21,687
See New York in all its
different lights and shades.

469
00:28:22,016 --> 00:28:23,088
High life. Low life.

470
00:28:23,443 --> 00:28:24,516
Uptown and downtown.

471
00:28:25,834 --> 00:28:26,935
Starting say, with ..

472
00:28:27,407 --> 00:28:29,532
Dinner at the St Regis.
Or The Embassy maybe.

473
00:28:30,115 --> 00:28:32,123
Dance a little.
Drop in a little musical piece.

474
00:28:32,621 --> 00:28:33,957
Catch a night at the opera.

475
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:36,131
And then a midnight
flight above the city.

476
00:28:36,591 --> 00:28:38,122
We can turn the plane over and over.

477
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:45,151
The town would go round like a
wheel with you sitting on the hub.

478
00:28:46,388 --> 00:28:48,748
You'll never know New York until
you see it as the moon sees it.

479
00:28:49,287 --> 00:28:52,334
Then a nightclub or two.
And out in time to catch the sunrise.

480
00:28:52,659 --> 00:28:53,932
Somewhere along the Hudson.

481
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,671
The sun does some of its very
nicest rising around here.

482
00:28:57,672 --> 00:29:00,824
Then we could separate long enough
for a bath and a change of clothes.

483
00:29:01,093 --> 00:29:02,886
You think you can live
without me that long?

484
00:29:03,156 --> 00:29:04,950
After 12 hours of Jamie Darricott.

485
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:07,560
I doubt if I would be able
to breathe any other air.

486
00:29:08,915 --> 00:29:11,061
And after breakfast we'll
keep on going and going.

487
00:29:11,906 --> 00:29:12,797
And at 7:30.

488
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:14,537
I deposit you at your train.

489
00:29:15,327 --> 00:29:18,181
I doubt if we would be able to
stand more than a 24-hour stretch.

490
00:29:18,541 --> 00:29:20,413
Perhaps you could stand it for 24 hours.

491
00:29:20,772 --> 00:29:21,702
You are strong.

492
00:29:22,451 --> 00:29:24,399
But I'm just a weak,
defenseless little woman.

493
00:29:24,986 --> 00:29:26,371
Ah. But you could trust me.

494
00:29:27,244 --> 00:29:28,631
Perhaps it's me I am afraid of.

495
00:29:30,573 --> 00:29:31,331
You know.

496
00:29:31,696 --> 00:29:33,327
There is only one slight catch.

497
00:29:34,022 --> 00:29:37,025
I'm meeting my aunt here and she stays
with me until I take the train at 7:30.

498
00:29:37,391 --> 00:29:39,719
Ah, then it's a bargain.
You get rid of your aunt.

499
00:29:40,235 --> 00:29:43,078
Telegraph your people you've been
unavoidably detained for 24 hours.

500
00:29:43,986 --> 00:29:45,601
And at 7:30 I will call for you.

501
00:29:46,019 --> 00:29:46,731
Where?

502
00:29:47,295 --> 00:29:48,597
At the Transylvania Station.

503
00:29:49,405 --> 00:29:50,678
I don't know which track.

504
00:29:51,006 --> 00:29:53,213
I will take you to the train
myself tomorrow night.

505
00:29:54,593 --> 00:29:55,878
When I return to New York.

506
00:29:56,066 --> 00:29:58,169
That is the time for the
Darricott round-the-town tour.

507
00:29:58,396 --> 00:30:00,182
You may never get back
and I may be dead.

508
00:30:00,612 --> 00:30:01,227
You?

509
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:02,862
You'll live for ever.

510
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:03,865
I doubt it.

511
00:30:04,195 --> 00:30:06,267
Dying is getting to be quite
a habit around here.

512
00:30:06,774 --> 00:30:08,934
And it's a terrible thing to
die without seeing New York.

513
00:30:09,291 --> 00:30:10,364
And Jamie Darricott.

514
00:30:11,977 --> 00:30:13,022
You will come back?

515
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:14,280
Certainly not.

516
00:30:15,384 --> 00:30:17,319
For one thing. My trunks are packed.

517
00:30:17,832 --> 00:30:19,070
That's easy. Unpack them.

518
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,728
I can't. They are shipped.

519
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:22,357
Easier still. But a dress.

520
00:30:23,164 --> 00:30:25,753
As a matter of fact, you should have a
new gown when you go out with me.

521
00:30:27,071 --> 00:30:28,115
You are impossible.

522
00:30:28,822 --> 00:30:30,345
Perhaps that's what makes me ..

523
00:30:31,140 --> 00:30:32,012
Possible?

524
00:30:33,588 --> 00:30:34,804
Your aunt is approaching.

525
00:30:35,418 --> 00:30:37,890
You'd better not tell her of our plans.
She'll want to come along.

526
00:30:38,879 --> 00:30:41,426
What is the name of your hotel?
- The Holland Plaza.

527
00:30:41,814 --> 00:30:42,749
And your name?

528
00:30:43,805 --> 00:30:44,817
Norma Page.

529
00:30:45,667 --> 00:30:47,025
I will be there at 7:30.

530
00:30:49,121 --> 00:30:51,602
How do you do, Mrs Blanton.
- How do you do, Mr Darricott.

531
00:30:52,062 --> 00:30:55,095
Hello, aunt Theresa. I waited for you
and then Mr Darricott came along.

532
00:30:55,498 --> 00:30:57,314
That's the best thing
Mr Darricott has done.

533
00:30:58,304 --> 00:31:00,192
Women are always waiting for someone.

534
00:31:00,663 --> 00:31:04,084
And Mr Darricott comes along.
- Unfortunately, not always.

535
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:05,927
I'm horribly late, Norma.

536
00:31:06,305 --> 00:31:08,549
I suppose I dare not allow
myself to believe that ..

537
00:31:08,938 --> 00:31:11,134
Fate arranged your lateness
for my special benefit?

538
00:31:11,488 --> 00:31:13,648
I am afraid not. It was the hairdresser.

539
00:31:14,088 --> 00:31:14,932
Come, Norma.

540
00:31:15,238 --> 00:31:17,169
Goodbye, Mr Darricott.
- Goodbye, Mrs Blanton.

541
00:31:18,362 --> 00:31:19,510
Au revoir, Miss Page.

542
00:31:20,296 --> 00:31:21,028
Goodbye.

543
00:31:31,793 --> 00:31:34,160
Mr James Darricott calling
for Miss Norma Page.

544
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:38,153
I am sorry, sir. Miss Page checked out
of the hotel and left half an hour ago.

545
00:31:40,089 --> 00:31:41,132
You are quite sure?

546
00:31:41,426 --> 00:31:42,233
Yes, sir.

547
00:31:42,709 --> 00:31:44,416
She left this note for you, sir.

548
00:31:47,269 --> 00:31:48,056
Thank you.

549
00:31:52,688 --> 00:31:55,392
Mr Darricott. You didn't really believe
you could order me around, did you?

550
00:31:57,151 --> 00:32:00,069
I'm leaving for home as I told
you I would at seven-thirty.

551
00:32:01,780 --> 00:32:03,220
Or is it goodbye? N.P.

552
00:32:17,928 --> 00:32:18,629
Gaston.

553
00:32:19,562 --> 00:32:21,280
Come on now.
You can do better than this.

554
00:32:47,041 --> 00:32:47,957
All aboard.

555
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:55,278
Seeing someone off, Mr Darricott?

556
00:33:00,563 --> 00:33:02,336
Don't tell me you're
at a loss for words.

557
00:33:04,689 --> 00:33:06,105
I'm glad you came to see me off.

558
00:33:06,532 --> 00:33:09,178
If you hadn't, there's another train in
an hour and I would have taken it.

559
00:33:10,714 --> 00:33:11,329
Now.

560
00:33:11,907 --> 00:33:14,111
If you still want to show
me your New York.

561
00:33:16,642 --> 00:33:17,732
Now more than ever.

562
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:19,644
Well?

563
00:33:20,733 --> 00:33:21,402
Well.

564
00:33:22,718 --> 00:33:24,262
On your left we have the city hall.

565
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:29,582
Is this an automobile or bedroom?

566
00:33:31,094 --> 00:33:32,032
It's a loan.

567
00:33:32,499 --> 00:33:33,384
From a lady?

568
00:33:34,372 --> 00:33:35,159
Naturally.

569
00:33:36,084 --> 00:33:38,217
I told the owner I had
to call on a sick aunt.

570
00:33:38,825 --> 00:33:40,171
And you are the sick aunt.

571
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,175
If you don't mind ..

572
00:33:42,392 --> 00:33:44,044
I'll dismiss it when we get to St Regis.

573
00:33:44,570 --> 00:33:45,442
Thanks a lot.

574
00:33:45,648 --> 00:33:47,529
A dirty old taxi that
everybody rides in ..

575
00:33:47,717 --> 00:33:50,925
Is so much nicer than some individual's
too-private car, don't you think?

576
00:33:51,901 --> 00:33:52,752
Or do you?

577
00:33:54,311 --> 00:33:55,095
I think.

578
00:34:01,351 --> 00:34:02,223
Hello, Jamie.

579
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:04,559
Well, hello.

580
00:34:05,244 --> 00:34:06,304
How do you do.

581
00:34:06,784 --> 00:34:08,293
I am glad your aunt is better.

582
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:10,643
Oh yes. Much.

583
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:12,729
You are not alone?

584
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:14,574
I'm waiting for Horace and Tony.

585
00:34:14,874 --> 00:34:16,565
We dine here and then go on to the play.

586
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:18,127
Yes. That's nice.

587
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,546
You'll have a splendid evening.

588
00:34:20,734 --> 00:34:21,890
I am sure we shall.

589
00:34:22,848 --> 00:34:24,135
Remember me to your aunt.

590
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,271
Thanks.

591
00:34:26,914 --> 00:34:28,387
She wants to be remembered to you.

592
00:34:29,601 --> 00:34:32,386
Doesn't it embarrass you?
Meeting her here and dining with me?

593
00:34:33,437 --> 00:34:34,023
No.

594
00:34:34,404 --> 00:34:36,132
Well .. it embarrasses me.

595
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:40,047
We'll go to the Aristide instead.
It's nicer anyway.

596
00:34:40,474 --> 00:34:42,748
There's been a shooting every
night there for the last month.

597
00:34:43,232 --> 00:34:44,567
Let's go this way.

598
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:47,024
I suppose Mrs Fendley
will hate you after this.

599
00:34:47,838 --> 00:34:49,496
No. She will merely hate you.

600
00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:53,543
Tell me about her.

601
00:34:54,528 --> 00:34:56,259
There's nothing to tell.
To her discredit.

602
00:34:56,857 --> 00:34:59,331
Which is all that would interest
another woman I imagine.

603
00:35:11,812 --> 00:35:13,879
How many cocktails have we had tonight?

604
00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:16,740
I don't know. I gave up counting at six.

605
00:35:17,142 --> 00:35:19,265
Do you want to know why
you gave up counting at six?

606
00:35:21,638 --> 00:35:24,103
Alright. Why did I give
up counting at six?

607
00:35:25,258 --> 00:35:27,309
Because you cannot count over six.

608
00:35:27,713 --> 00:35:29,524
Hector. Number One for Mr Darricott.

609
00:35:30,915 --> 00:35:31,848
Who's that?

610
00:35:33,021 --> 00:35:33,920
It's Jamie.

611
00:35:37,739 --> 00:35:39,759
The town seems to be dripping
with Fendleys tonight.

612
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:56,520
A sick aunt, huh?

613
00:35:57,789 --> 00:35:59,326
You dirty liar.

614
00:35:59,617 --> 00:36:01,251
Shush. You are a lady.

615
00:36:02,133 --> 00:36:04,269
Two tall glasses and some ice water.

616
00:36:06,957 --> 00:36:08,001
Won't you sit down?

617
00:36:08,225 --> 00:36:10,713
It's just as well you
didn't go with mother.

618
00:36:11,136 --> 00:36:12,638
Because dad would have sighted you.

619
00:36:13,076 --> 00:36:17,698
He's the only one in the whole town who
doesn't know of mother's frenzy for you.

620
00:36:19,021 --> 00:36:19,693
Jamie.

621
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,755
If you and mother don't look out ..

622
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,032
There will be the loudest
eruption since Vesuvius.

623
00:36:26,553 --> 00:36:28,500
Did you hear what I said about mother?

624
00:36:29,373 --> 00:36:30,789
Everyone has except the drummer.

625
00:36:32,701 --> 00:36:34,353
I want to extend to you.

626
00:36:35,067 --> 00:36:36,810
By a unanimous vote of thanks.

627
00:36:37,139 --> 00:36:39,026
For carrying Jamie off this evening.

628
00:36:40,247 --> 00:36:42,252
If you keep him from mother.

629
00:36:42,862 --> 00:36:44,748
I'll give you a pension for life.

630
00:36:45,470 --> 00:36:48,153
Then, when I want him I'll
just take him away from you.

631
00:36:49,314 --> 00:36:51,291
Could anything be fairer than that?

632
00:36:51,902 --> 00:36:53,017
Shall we dance?

633
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:54,776
We?

634
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:56,852
I may.

635
00:36:57,514 --> 00:36:58,729
But we can't.

636
00:37:00,659 --> 00:37:02,929
Did you ever dance with Jamie, Miss ..?

637
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:04,401
Miss ..?

638
00:37:04,933 --> 00:37:07,275
I hope you know your own name. I know.

639
00:37:08,083 --> 00:37:11,179
I am Miss Fendley if anybody
should happen to ask you. But ..

640
00:37:12,766 --> 00:37:13,843
Where was I?

641
00:37:18,348 --> 00:37:21,005
Mother doesn't approve
of me dancing with Jamie.

642
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:23,490
She wants to have him all to herself.

643
00:37:25,716 --> 00:37:26,710
Rachel.

644
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,218
Will you do me a big favor?

645
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,387
I'll do you any flavor, honey.

646
00:37:31,708 --> 00:37:32,842
Then go home.

647
00:37:33,526 --> 00:37:35,592
You're in no condition
for public appearances.

648
00:37:36,236 --> 00:37:38,630
Jamie, you do me a cruel injustice.

649
00:37:38,954 --> 00:37:39,884
Rachel, please.

650
00:37:40,429 --> 00:37:41,973
Sit back there where you belong.

651
00:37:42,161 --> 00:37:43,827
Well, I'd rather belong to you.

652
00:37:45,851 --> 00:37:47,905
I'm mad about you, if you want to know.

653
00:37:53,516 --> 00:37:54,446
Shall we dance?

654
00:38:18,023 --> 00:38:19,274
So I'll bet you a million.

655
00:38:20,016 --> 00:38:20,949
You're on.

656
00:38:22,757 --> 00:38:24,720
Nope. I have changed my mind.

657
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:28,544
You're trying to take advantage of me.

658
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:36,442
Jamie.

659
00:38:36,705 --> 00:38:37,456
Jamie.

660
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,708
Jamie. Peyton Walden here bets
me a million I'll marry him.

661
00:38:41,094 --> 00:38:42,878
I'll bet him a million
he don't marry me.

662
00:38:43,325 --> 00:38:46,442
Come on, Mr Walden.
Put your million in Jamie's hands.

663
00:38:48,557 --> 00:38:49,543
Very likely.

664
00:38:50,604 --> 00:38:52,779
Oh, very likely.
- Put up or shut up.

665
00:38:53,333 --> 00:38:54,567
Where is your million?

666
00:38:54,889 --> 00:38:55,850
Where's yours?

667
00:38:56,038 --> 00:38:57,903
I don't have to have
mine because you lose.

668
00:38:58,427 --> 00:38:59,685
You answered me already.

669
00:39:00,187 --> 00:39:01,707
How do you make that out?

670
00:39:02,084 --> 00:39:04,131
You bet me a million
that you'd marry me.

671
00:39:04,626 --> 00:39:07,775
I am the one to decide.
I decide you don't marry me.

672
00:39:08,207 --> 00:39:10,250
I bet you another million I do.

673
00:39:11,948 --> 00:39:13,442
I'll take that back too.

674
00:39:13,844 --> 00:39:15,146
Alright. Where's your money?

675
00:39:15,468 --> 00:39:18,914
Pay me the million you owe on the first
bet and I'll put it up for the second.

676
00:39:19,577 --> 00:39:21,417
I don't owe you.
- See?

677
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:23,309
You are a welsher.

678
00:39:23,894 --> 00:39:26,232
Do you imagine I would marry a welsher?

679
00:39:27,152 --> 00:39:28,829
You will marry me.
- Never.

680
00:39:29,142 --> 00:39:31,086
Never, never speak to me again.
Do you hear?

681
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:33,746
Miss whoosis ..

682
00:39:34,497 --> 00:39:36,369
Would you marry a welsher?

683
00:39:37,045 --> 00:39:38,081
Who cares?

684
00:39:38,379 --> 00:39:39,876
I'm going to make a riot with you.

685
00:39:40,958 --> 00:39:42,400
Rachel.
- What do you want?

686
00:39:43,141 --> 00:39:44,160
Now listen to me.

687
00:39:44,895 --> 00:39:47,163
I want you to get Peyton out
of here and take him home.

688
00:39:47,859 --> 00:39:49,496
You don't want to make a riot with him.

689
00:39:49,783 --> 00:39:51,636
He'll bite himself and
die of hydrophobia.

690
00:39:52,084 --> 00:39:53,255
I'm going home myself.

691
00:39:53,734 --> 00:39:55,658
You want me to get old Peyton home?

692
00:39:56,291 --> 00:39:58,545
That's it exactly.
Miss Page and I are leaving.

693
00:39:59,568 --> 00:40:00,408
I got it.

694
00:40:01,704 --> 00:40:02,509
I got it.

695
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:06,359
I'll get old Peyton home.
Never mind, I'll handle him.

696
00:40:07,275 --> 00:40:08,007
Peyton.

697
00:40:08,577 --> 00:40:10,540
Peyton, old boy, old boy, old boy.

698
00:40:11,278 --> 00:40:12,007
Come on.

699
00:40:12,461 --> 00:40:13,194
Go home.

700
00:40:19,579 --> 00:40:21,836
I never knew it could get to
five in the morning so quickly.

701
00:40:22,024 --> 00:40:23,955
I never knew it could get
to five in the morning.

702
00:40:24,899 --> 00:40:25,779
Where to now?

703
00:40:26,042 --> 00:40:27,401
To my hotel if you don't mind.

704
00:40:28,988 --> 00:40:30,048
What is the matter?

705
00:40:30,236 --> 00:40:32,514
Am I a kill-sport by going home
in the middle of the evening?

706
00:40:32,702 --> 00:40:35,168
Why, you haven't even seen the
skyline from my apartment yet.

707
00:40:35,741 --> 00:40:36,862
Mr Darricott.

708
00:40:38,092 --> 00:40:40,820
You don't mean you are asking me to
your apartment to see your ship models?

709
00:40:41,384 --> 00:40:43,970
Or is it your collection of
real old English bindings?

710
00:40:44,405 --> 00:40:46,154
I haven't read a novel for months, so ..

711
00:40:46,473 --> 00:40:48,026
I'm not quite sure what the ruse is.

712
00:40:48,918 --> 00:40:51,199
When I invite you to my
apartment to see the skyline.

713
00:40:51,702 --> 00:40:54,179
I invite you to my apartment to
see the skyline and that's all.

714
00:40:55,014 --> 00:40:56,516
Maybe that's why I am disappointed.

715
00:40:56,874 --> 00:40:59,055
It's really the most beautiful
sight in the whole city.

716
00:40:59,243 --> 00:41:01,603
Particularly at this hour with
dawn just breaking over the town.

717
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:04,363
Skyscrapers like so many jagged peaks.

718
00:41:05,113 --> 00:41:05,957
The streets.

719
00:41:06,235 --> 00:41:07,426
Like so many canyons.

720
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:09,729
Alright.

721
00:41:10,254 --> 00:41:11,041
I'll come.

722
00:41:13,212 --> 00:41:13,856
Taxi.

723
00:41:18,624 --> 00:41:19,239
Sir.

724
00:41:19,974 --> 00:41:21,668
I am sorry, Mr Darricott.

725
00:41:22,087 --> 00:41:22,936
I tried.

726
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:25,025
I don't understand.

727
00:41:25,441 --> 00:41:26,542
I think I understand.

728
00:41:27,357 --> 00:41:28,185
What is it?

729
00:41:28,456 --> 00:41:31,048
Miss Fendley, sir. Miss Rachel Fendley.

730
00:41:31,688 --> 00:41:32,274
Oh.

731
00:41:32,938 --> 00:41:33,896
Alright, Eugene.

732
00:41:37,272 --> 00:41:39,505
I should hate to interfere with
any of your engagements.

733
00:41:41,299 --> 00:41:42,372
Please don't go now.

734
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:43,934
I may need your help.

735
00:42:00,287 --> 00:42:00,959
Hello.

736
00:42:02,287 --> 00:42:04,593
I got rid of Peyton as you told me.

737
00:42:05,367 --> 00:42:06,268
And here I am.

738
00:42:10,083 --> 00:42:11,499
I told you to get rid of Peyton?

739
00:42:15,616 --> 00:42:16,889
Who are you trying to fool?

740
00:42:17,286 --> 00:42:18,330
Yourself or Miss ..

741
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:20,338
Miss whatshername there?

742
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:24,814
I am awful tired.

743
00:42:26,129 --> 00:42:27,402
Yes. I can understand that.

744
00:42:28,924 --> 00:42:31,544
You've got to go home.
- No. I don't want to go home.

745
00:42:31,939 --> 00:42:34,461
She cannot go home in this condition.
Why not put her to bed here?

746
00:42:34,842 --> 00:42:36,245
No. I don't want to go to bed.

747
00:42:36,433 --> 00:42:38,507
You want me to help you?
- I don't know what I want.

748
00:42:38,814 --> 00:42:40,572
What you want most right now is sleep.

749
00:42:41,552 --> 00:42:42,224
Jamie.

750
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:44,317
Come on, child. Put your arm around me.

751
00:42:45,514 --> 00:42:46,959
There is a bedroom just in there.

752
00:42:49,493 --> 00:42:50,909
You'll find everything you need.

753
00:42:51,176 --> 00:42:52,505
We women must stick together.

754
00:42:52,693 --> 00:42:54,537
No. I don't want to stick together.

755
00:42:59,692 --> 00:43:01,079
There you are. Right over here.

756
00:43:01,875 --> 00:43:02,670
Jamie.

757
00:43:07,523 --> 00:43:09,335
Listen, darling. Over here. Come on.
- No.

758
00:43:09,748 --> 00:43:11,078
Let me help you.
- No.

759
00:43:12,171 --> 00:43:13,911
I don't want to go home.

760
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:15,657
No. Me do it.

761
00:43:17,737 --> 00:43:18,323
No.

762
00:43:19,277 --> 00:43:20,000
Jamie.

763
00:43:20,757 --> 00:43:21,429
Jamie.

764
00:43:25,112 --> 00:43:25,794
Jamie.

765
00:43:29,719 --> 00:43:31,554
I'll have coffee ready
in a few moments, sir.

766
00:43:31,742 --> 00:43:32,385
Good.

767
00:43:33,128 --> 00:43:33,800
And ..

768
00:43:35,462 --> 00:43:38,072
Tell the operator downstairs
that I am not in to anyone.

769
00:43:38,499 --> 00:43:39,429
Very good, sir.

770
00:43:52,606 --> 00:43:54,897
I couldn't get her in the
tub but she's asleep now.

771
00:43:56,027 --> 00:43:57,786
There was a picture in
there of her mother.

772
00:43:58,251 --> 00:43:59,696
It seemed to bother her a little.

773
00:44:01,998 --> 00:44:03,463
A nice little civilization.

774
00:44:04,377 --> 00:44:07,279
A million young men and women all
over the country at this very moment.

775
00:44:07,645 --> 00:44:08,579
Drunk like her.

776
00:44:09,448 --> 00:44:11,179
Not to mention their
fathers and mothers.

777
00:44:36,161 --> 00:44:36,948
Our plane.

778
00:44:38,832 --> 00:44:42,274
It was going to make the town go round
like a wheel with me sitting on the hub.

779
00:44:44,452 --> 00:44:45,983
'You never know New York'.

780
00:44:46,411 --> 00:44:48,046
'Until you see it as the moon sees it'.

781
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:52,991
It was a nice speech.

782
00:44:53,593 --> 00:44:55,326
What we call a 'good approach' in golf.

783
00:44:56,643 --> 00:44:57,780
But I'm afraid you ..

784
00:44:58,680 --> 00:44:59,838
You dubbed your putt.

785
00:45:01,991 --> 00:45:03,482
We played only the first hole.

786
00:45:10,583 --> 00:45:11,260
Jamie.

787
00:45:12,858 --> 00:45:13,551
Jamie.

788
00:45:14,322 --> 00:45:15,052
Jamie.

789
00:45:16,913 --> 00:45:17,585
Jamie.

790
00:45:18,068 --> 00:45:19,026
You'd better go.

791
00:45:27,265 --> 00:45:29,714
I don't know why I don't
kill you, Jamie Darricott.

792
00:45:31,263 --> 00:45:32,622
I waited here for you tonight.

793
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:34,333
No-one asked you to wait for me.

794
00:45:34,596 --> 00:45:35,761
Who has a better idea?

795
00:45:36,614 --> 00:45:37,830
If you are lying to me ..

796
00:45:38,866 --> 00:45:40,644
If you're not going to
marry me I will ..

797
00:45:41,621 --> 00:45:42,644
I'll kill myself.

798
00:45:43,019 --> 00:45:43,720
Rachel.

799
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:49,816
Maybe you don't think I
know what I am saying.

800
00:45:50,361 --> 00:45:51,119
But I do.

801
00:45:56,225 --> 00:45:57,469
Are you going to marry me?

802
00:45:59,596 --> 00:46:00,325
Are you?

803
00:46:06,578 --> 00:46:07,565
I don't think so.

804
00:46:11,291 --> 00:46:13,766
I want to see Mr Darricott.
- Sorry, sir. But Mr Darricott is not ..

805
00:46:14,039 --> 00:46:16,063
You can't stop me.
- I already told you, sir.

806
00:46:16,411 --> 00:46:18,465
Mr Darricott is not at home.
- But I know he's here.

807
00:46:18,819 --> 00:46:20,584
Excuse me, sir.
- Keep out of my way.

808
00:46:21,586 --> 00:46:23,668
Excuse me, sir. One moment.
- I've come for my sister.

809
00:46:24,514 --> 00:46:25,884
Hello brother of mine.

810
00:46:27,158 --> 00:46:28,532
You dirty ..
- Tony.

811
00:46:28,997 --> 00:46:30,098
You keep out of this.

812
00:46:30,939 --> 00:46:31,640
Listen.

813
00:46:32,246 --> 00:46:34,109
I got sick from liquor and Miss ..

814
00:46:34,476 --> 00:46:36,033
Miss whoosis here put me to bed.

815
00:46:36,381 --> 00:46:37,310
And that's all.

816
00:46:38,011 --> 00:46:40,981
And if you weren't such a phoney saint
you'd be on your knees to both of them.

817
00:46:44,117 --> 00:46:44,932
I am sorry.

818
00:46:47,243 --> 00:46:48,487
May I take you ..
- Home?

819
00:46:50,279 --> 00:46:54,590
And let you make an entrance with the
erring sister and a few hallelujahs?

820
00:46:55,303 --> 00:46:56,853
Ha-ha .. and ha.

821
00:46:58,818 --> 00:47:00,878
Say. How did you know I was here?

822
00:47:01,350 --> 00:47:04,411
Peyton followed you and watched you
come into this hotel. Then he phoned me.

823
00:47:04,737 --> 00:47:06,643
But he must have known
that Miss Page and I ..

824
00:47:06,925 --> 00:47:08,856
Everybody knows you have
your women come up here.

825
00:47:09,591 --> 00:47:12,499
You've laid your filthy hands
on my family for the last time.

826
00:47:13,538 --> 00:47:15,649
I hear so many people say
somebody ought to kill you.

827
00:47:15,879 --> 00:47:16,639
Shut up!

828
00:47:18,180 --> 00:47:20,897
Any woman who has anything
to do with Jamie Darricott ..

829
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:23,183
Has no-one to blame but herself.

830
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:27,959
Any account I have to settle with him ..

831
00:47:28,578 --> 00:47:29,508
I settle alone.

832
00:47:31,122 --> 00:47:32,065
Get out, Tony.

833
00:48:02,187 --> 00:48:03,946
I think I'll go home
now if you don't mind.

834
00:48:05,365 --> 00:48:06,981
Shall I see you again before you leave?

835
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:08,403
I'm leaving tonight.

836
00:48:10,162 --> 00:48:11,784
You may have tea with me if you like.

837
00:48:12,762 --> 00:48:13,463
I like.

838
00:48:14,509 --> 00:48:15,804
At my hotel then. Say at ..

839
00:48:16,211 --> 00:48:17,055
Four-thirty?

840
00:48:17,521 --> 00:48:18,451
At four-thirty.

841
00:48:19,719 --> 00:48:20,620
I'll be there.

842
00:48:22,257 --> 00:48:23,044
Goodnight.

843
00:48:25,639 --> 00:48:27,125
I don't know what to say about ..

844
00:48:27,688 --> 00:48:28,560
Don't say it.

845
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:32,383
Thanks.

846
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,129
You know.

847
00:48:37,722 --> 00:48:38,909
I am beginning to think.

848
00:48:40,509 --> 00:48:41,153
What?

849
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:44,914
Never mind.

850
00:48:53,598 --> 00:48:55,206
They say you are without a conscience.

851
00:48:57,879 --> 00:49:00,508
The more I know of other people's
morals the more I realise that ..

852
00:49:01,154 --> 00:49:02,508
Mine are as good as the next.

853
00:49:03,751 --> 00:49:05,490
The only difference I can see is that ..

854
00:49:06,427 --> 00:49:07,456
I don't pretend.

855
00:49:08,324 --> 00:49:09,524
They say you are lazy.

856
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:13,021
Lazier than most people I suppose.

857
00:49:16,483 --> 00:49:17,480
Too lazy to ..

858
00:49:18,103 --> 00:49:19,233
Earn a living perhaps?

859
00:49:29,950 --> 00:49:30,622
Norma.

860
00:49:33,339 --> 00:49:34,698
Since I can remember anything.

861
00:49:35,833 --> 00:49:37,397
I remember being picked up by women.

862
00:49:39,435 --> 00:49:41,137
They used to maul me
around in my cradle.

863
00:49:42,686 --> 00:49:44,188
By and by I learned that I could ..

864
00:49:44,962 --> 00:49:45,949
Make money by it.

865
00:49:46,700 --> 00:49:47,746
I hated to study.

866
00:49:48,375 --> 00:49:49,914
I wouldn't run errands or ..

867
00:49:50,288 --> 00:49:51,332
Deliver newspapers.

868
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:53,013
Keep a lemonade stand.

869
00:49:53,746 --> 00:49:55,763
Or do any of the things that
kids do to earn a dime.

870
00:49:56,944 --> 00:49:57,759
Eventually.

871
00:49:58,323 --> 00:49:59,539
I became a bond salesman.

872
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,910
But the only opportunities that
seemed to come my way were ..

873
00:50:04,115 --> 00:50:05,260
Well, when some ..

874
00:50:05,856 --> 00:50:08,795
Skittish dowager needed to be
convinced that she wanted bonds.

875
00:50:09,865 --> 00:50:12,723
But never a deal involving
logic or common sense.

876
00:50:14,245 --> 00:50:15,331
That is no excuse.

877
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:17,150
Of course not.

878
00:50:18,137 --> 00:50:19,439
But the skittish dowagers ..

879
00:50:20,504 --> 00:50:23,679
Usually seemed more interested
in me than in my bonds.

880
00:50:25,216 --> 00:50:27,629
And it was not that I
squandered flattery on them.

881
00:50:28,925 --> 00:50:29,969
If anything they ..

882
00:50:31,493 --> 00:50:32,709
They squandered it on me.

883
00:50:34,305 --> 00:50:34,942
Why?

884
00:50:37,779 --> 00:50:40,694
Perhaps it's because I look at women
the way other women look at them.

885
00:50:42,070 --> 00:50:42,942
The men make.

886
00:50:43,659 --> 00:50:44,732
And the women spend.

887
00:50:45,847 --> 00:50:48,242
How many wives let their husbands
work themselves to death ..

888
00:50:49,002 --> 00:50:50,704
And then complain that
they're neglected?

889
00:50:51,309 --> 00:50:52,754
They spend their husband's money.

890
00:50:53,623 --> 00:50:54,495
On other men.

891
00:50:54,937 --> 00:50:55,638
On you?

892
00:50:59,102 --> 00:50:59,790
On me.

893
00:51:01,408 --> 00:51:02,309
Oh, that is ..

894
00:51:02,878 --> 00:51:03,632
I know.

895
00:51:04,868 --> 00:51:06,170
That is everything that's ..

896
00:51:06,455 --> 00:51:08,228
Low and unspeakable.

897
00:51:09,301 --> 00:51:10,460
Then why did you do it?

898
00:51:12,386 --> 00:51:14,992
I suppose because I thought
I couldn't help myself.

899
00:51:17,837 --> 00:51:18,725
I was wrong.

900
00:51:23,140 --> 00:51:23,929
I'm sorry.

901
00:51:33,003 --> 00:51:34,619
Norma, I am going to ask you something.

902
00:51:37,945 --> 00:51:39,476
I shan't mind what your reaction is.

903
00:51:40,066 --> 00:51:41,172
Except for one thing.

904
00:51:42,748 --> 00:51:43,592
Don't laugh.

905
00:51:44,258 --> 00:51:45,302
Please don't laugh.

906
00:51:47,557 --> 00:51:48,458
I won't laugh.

907
00:51:52,052 --> 00:51:54,803
I used to feel amused when I heard
of it happening to other people.

908
00:51:56,436 --> 00:51:57,738
But now it's happened to me.

909
00:51:58,930 --> 00:52:00,836
And it seems just simple and natural.

910
00:52:03,293 --> 00:52:04,114
I love you.

911
00:52:05,776 --> 00:52:07,020
But that's not a question.

912
00:52:09,546 --> 00:52:10,933
Do you think you could ever ..

913
00:52:11,365 --> 00:52:12,255
Care for me?

914
00:52:14,148 --> 00:52:15,478
That is a question, isn't it?

915
00:52:16,064 --> 00:52:16,708
Well.

916
00:52:17,206 --> 00:52:18,690
I suppose I could fall for you.

917
00:52:20,310 --> 00:52:21,211
I have fallen.

918
00:52:21,672 --> 00:52:22,630
Into the clouds.

919
00:52:24,455 --> 00:52:25,986
Heaven help me when I start to drop.

920
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:28,839
You don't have to drop.

921
00:52:29,273 --> 00:52:30,403
If you do not want to.

922
00:52:34,337 --> 00:52:35,443
If I don't want to?

923
00:52:37,886 --> 00:52:39,387
Is that your answer to my question?

924
00:52:40,316 --> 00:52:41,804
What do you expect me to answer?

925
00:52:43,486 --> 00:52:44,363
I don't know.

926
00:52:46,191 --> 00:52:47,771
If I thought you could care for me.

927
00:52:49,399 --> 00:52:50,504
I could care for ..

928
00:52:51,067 --> 00:52:52,083
What you might be.

929
00:52:55,063 --> 00:52:56,637
I can be what you want me to be.

930
00:53:00,304 --> 00:53:02,473
That was the whole job, eh?
- Yes, sir.

931
00:53:08,397 --> 00:53:09,999
Yes. I will see her in a moment.

932
00:53:15,742 --> 00:53:17,273
Thanks very much for your frankness.

933
00:53:18,104 --> 00:53:20,866
My detectives traced the
jewelry to your shop.

934
00:53:21,218 --> 00:53:23,409
We'd have had a lot of trouble
getting hold of it all ..

935
00:53:23,597 --> 00:53:25,177
If you'd been unwilling to cooperate.

936
00:53:25,566 --> 00:53:27,275
I always aim to do the right thing, sir.

937
00:53:28,294 --> 00:53:29,882
You've done the right thing this time.

938
00:53:30,272 --> 00:53:32,704
I'll see that you don't lose by it.
- Thank you, sir.

939
00:53:33,375 --> 00:53:34,859
Alright. That will be all.

940
00:54:08,372 --> 00:54:09,777
Well, Rachel my dear?

941
00:54:10,763 --> 00:54:11,593
Hello dad.

942
00:54:13,357 --> 00:54:15,488
You're looking very
smart it seems to me.

943
00:54:16,108 --> 00:54:17,340
Am I?
- Hmm.

944
00:54:19,202 --> 00:54:19,846
Well?

945
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:21,594
What's the matter?

946
00:54:21,977 --> 00:54:23,050
You lost your nerve?

947
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:26,254
You've spent your allowance
and you want another check.

948
00:54:26,752 --> 00:54:27,939
'Just this once, daddy'.

949
00:54:28,924 --> 00:54:31,013
It's not money. It's much more serious.

950
00:54:31,754 --> 00:54:35,998
If it isn't money, you take it from your
poor old father that it's not serious.

951
00:54:36,665 --> 00:54:37,709
It is very serious.

952
00:54:39,197 --> 00:54:41,308
Good gracious.
Don't tell me you are in love?

953
00:54:42,185 --> 00:54:43,693
I'm not in love with anybody.

954
00:54:44,241 --> 00:54:44,948
Well.

955
00:54:45,989 --> 00:54:47,445
If you're not in love then ..

956
00:54:47,633 --> 00:54:49,545
There's something I
must talk to you about.

957
00:54:51,228 --> 00:54:52,115
Alright.

958
00:54:53,210 --> 00:54:54,833
Sit down there and talk to me about it.

959
00:54:56,517 --> 00:54:57,188
Well?

960
00:54:59,226 --> 00:55:00,118
It's mother.

961
00:55:00,493 --> 00:55:01,570
And Jamie Darricott.

962
00:55:02,136 --> 00:55:02,909
Mother?

963
00:55:03,387 --> 00:55:04,374
And Mr Darricott?

964
00:55:05,938 --> 00:55:06,939
What do you mean?

965
00:55:07,219 --> 00:55:08,978
You have got to do something about them.

966
00:55:09,891 --> 00:55:11,131
Do something?

967
00:55:12,456 --> 00:55:13,363
In what way?

968
00:55:14,123 --> 00:55:15,601
They're making a fool out of you.

969
00:55:16,492 --> 00:55:18,142
My dear child, don't be silly.

970
00:55:18,752 --> 00:55:20,661
Dad, you ought to kill Jamie Darricott.

971
00:55:21,319 --> 00:55:23,090
You've been reading too much trash.

972
00:55:23,748 --> 00:55:26,172
Jamie Darricott is the
lowest scoundrel I know.

973
00:55:26,571 --> 00:55:28,840
I could torture him for the way he's ..

974
00:55:29,366 --> 00:55:31,138
The way he has what?
- Nothing.

975
00:55:32,111 --> 00:55:33,642
It's just that he isn't fit to live.

976
00:55:36,362 --> 00:55:37,106
Rachel.

977
00:55:38,656 --> 00:55:39,986
Rachel. Listen to me.

978
00:55:41,831 --> 00:55:43,026
I trust your mother.

979
00:55:43,824 --> 00:55:44,639
Thoroughly.

980
00:55:45,105 --> 00:55:46,355
I like Mr Darricott.

981
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:49,794
You must remember that I haven't
the time to give to your mother ..

982
00:55:49,982 --> 00:55:51,369
That she has a right to demand.

983
00:55:52,580 --> 00:55:56,734
Mr Darricott kindly took her to the
opera and other places when I could not.

984
00:55:57,460 --> 00:55:59,324
And that's all there is.

985
00:56:01,205 --> 00:56:03,149
Between mother and Mr Darricott.
- Dad.

986
00:56:04,159 --> 00:56:05,247
You are blind.

987
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,039
If that's your only grievance
against Mr Darricott.

988
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:12,702
It is your only grievance against him?

989
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:13,798
Isn't it?

990
00:56:14,392 --> 00:56:15,204
Rachel.

991
00:56:17,735 --> 00:56:20,481
He hasn't become involved
with you, has he?

992
00:56:21,793 --> 00:56:23,210
Oh, my dear child.

993
00:56:23,567 --> 00:56:25,234
I have never seen you like this before.

994
00:56:26,501 --> 00:56:27,479
Now look here.

995
00:56:28,608 --> 00:56:29,904
If I were you.

996
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:33,180
I would forget all
about our little talk.

997
00:56:35,056 --> 00:56:38,028
I know more about mother
and Mr Darricott.

998
00:56:38,544 --> 00:56:39,712
Than you think I do.

999
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,040
More perhaps than you do.

1000
00:56:44,795 --> 00:56:45,414
Dad.

1001
00:56:46,213 --> 00:56:48,923
And there's absolutely nothing.

1002
00:56:49,786 --> 00:56:50,765
To worry about.

1003
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:54,756
There. Now, you run
along like a nice girl.

1004
00:56:55,950 --> 00:56:59,990
The great banker is going to
settle down and make more money.

1005
00:57:00,995 --> 00:57:04,488
And starve a couple of hundred
widows and orphans before nightfall.

1006
00:57:08,170 --> 00:57:09,157
Goodbye, darling.

1007
00:57:43,884 --> 00:57:45,405
I am not going to dodge anything.

1008
00:57:46,576 --> 00:57:48,561
I'll tell Mrs Fendley
frankly what's happened.

1009
00:57:49,372 --> 00:57:50,522
As soon as I can.

1010
00:57:51,057 --> 00:57:52,244
I am going to repay her.

1011
00:57:53,202 --> 00:57:54,275
As far as I am able.

1012
00:57:55,379 --> 00:57:57,579
I will give her back everything
that she has given me.

1013
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:00,145
Jamie.

1014
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:03,537
When you tell her.
Don't be unkind, will you.

1015
00:58:04,195 --> 00:58:05,702
No. I won't. I won't.

1016
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,143
And Norma.
- What is it, dear?

1017
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:11,644
I don't see how I can get out of this ..

1018
00:58:12,302 --> 00:58:14,094
Catherine and Potemkin thing.

1019
00:58:14,868 --> 00:58:17,314
It's been around town for weeks
that she's going to give this ball.

1020
00:58:17,615 --> 00:58:18,316
I know.

1021
00:58:18,739 --> 00:58:19,691
You should go.

1022
00:58:20,537 --> 00:58:22,194
It won't make any difference to me.

1023
00:58:22,722 --> 00:58:23,711
You know that.

1024
00:58:28,041 --> 00:58:29,265
I'll be back in a week.

1025
00:58:31,411 --> 00:58:32,741
You'll not be back in a week.

1026
00:58:33,605 --> 00:58:35,021
You're going to stay right here.

1027
00:58:36,049 --> 00:58:37,322
And the day after tomorrow.

1028
00:58:37,979 --> 00:58:39,383
We're going to be married.

1029
00:58:40,124 --> 00:58:41,270
What do you say?

1030
00:58:42,035 --> 00:58:42,822
Of course.

1031
00:58:45,332 --> 00:58:46,090
You know.

1032
00:58:46,642 --> 00:58:48,176
It's getting to be a habit with me.

1033
00:58:48,364 --> 00:58:50,849
Wiring my family that I'm not
taking the train after all.

1034
00:58:52,461 --> 00:58:54,992
When you take that train you
will take it as Mrs Darricott.

1035
00:58:55,409 --> 00:58:56,961
With me.
- You mean ..

1036
00:58:57,571 --> 00:58:59,948
You'll meet me at the station
again some night at 7:30?

1037
00:59:00,581 --> 00:59:01,997
I won't meet you at the station.

1038
00:59:02,830 --> 00:59:03,960
I will take you there.

1039
00:59:04,592 --> 00:59:06,653
That is definite.
- Definite and essential.

1040
00:59:07,037 --> 00:59:08,167
Because from now on ..

1041
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,125
When you are leaving or arriving.

1042
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:12,522
I will be leaving or arriving too.

1043
00:59:32,655 --> 00:59:33,368
Horace.

1044
00:59:33,644 --> 00:59:34,968
You frightened me.

1045
00:59:36,215 --> 00:59:36,932
Did I?

1046
00:59:37,331 --> 00:59:38,213
I am sorry.

1047
00:59:39,750 --> 00:59:41,577
Still determined not to go to the ball?

1048
00:59:43,633 --> 00:59:44,420
Like this?

1049
00:59:46,211 --> 00:59:47,787
It's going to be sensational.

1050
00:59:48,254 --> 00:59:51,157
Mary Millbank sent all the
way to Paris for her costume.

1051
00:59:52,537 --> 00:59:53,836
That will be all, Louise.

1052
00:59:55,448 --> 00:59:56,382
Catherine, eh?

1053
00:59:57,579 --> 00:59:58,875
And Potemkin?

1054
00:59:59,260 --> 01:00:00,346
Darricott I suppose?

1055
01:00:01,203 --> 01:00:04,382
Well, you positively refused
yourself to go. So ..

1056
01:00:07,486 --> 01:00:10,250
A great lover, wasn't he? Potemkin.

1057
01:00:11,406 --> 01:00:13,544
I don't need to tell
you what Potemkin was.

1058
01:00:14,955 --> 01:00:15,627
And ..

1059
01:00:16,389 --> 01:00:18,147
He died .. suddenly.

1060
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:20,290
Didn't he? Potemkin?

1061
01:00:21,116 --> 01:00:21,965
I think so.

1062
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:24,872
These ladies' men.

1063
01:00:25,209 --> 01:00:29,021
I suppose they all have a very definite
idea that they might run at any time ..

1064
01:00:29,354 --> 01:00:30,663
Into a sudden death?

1065
01:00:34,046 --> 01:00:34,747
Horace.

1066
01:00:35,263 --> 01:00:36,991
What are you driving at?

1067
01:00:38,976 --> 01:00:40,730
Well, if you mean to suggest that ..

1068
01:00:41,131 --> 01:00:42,579
That Jamie Darricott and I are ..

1069
01:00:42,894 --> 01:00:44,771
Why do you think I was
referring to Darricott?

1070
01:00:45,108 --> 01:00:47,380
It's been very nice of him to
take me out as often as he has.

1071
01:00:48,117 --> 01:00:50,158
You were tied up in
business or something.

1072
01:00:50,713 --> 01:00:53,139
I really don't know what I
should have done without him.

1073
01:00:54,062 --> 01:00:56,690
I have an idea that I owe him something.

1074
01:00:57,619 --> 01:00:58,959
For what he has done for you.

1075
01:01:01,586 --> 01:01:04,571
Horace. I don't know what
this is all about but ..

1076
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:10,693
Charming jewelry you're wearing tonight.

1077
01:01:12,097 --> 01:01:12,993
Thank you.

1078
01:01:14,385 --> 01:01:15,005
You.

1079
01:01:17,171 --> 01:01:20,121
You haven't worn your emerald
bracelet in a long time. Have you?

1080
01:01:23,250 --> 01:01:24,237
Emerald bracelet?

1081
01:01:25,005 --> 01:01:27,920
Yes. The one I gave
you on your birthday.

1082
01:01:30,125 --> 01:01:31,605
Oh, that one?

1083
01:01:33,308 --> 01:01:34,438
I am having it re-set.

1084
01:01:36,335 --> 01:01:39,944
I imagine Darricott knows a good
deal about jewelry, doesn't he?

1085
01:01:41,368 --> 01:01:42,223
Perhaps.

1086
01:01:42,932 --> 01:01:44,029
I haven't asked him.

1087
01:01:44,351 --> 01:01:45,261
You ought to.

1088
01:01:46,274 --> 01:01:47,280
He might ..

1089
01:01:48,128 --> 01:01:52,011
He might have some very
interesting ideas about jewelry.

1090
01:01:56,766 --> 01:01:57,467
Horace.

1091
01:01:58,031 --> 01:02:00,163
I insist upon knowing what
you've got on your mind.

1092
01:02:04,572 --> 01:02:05,273
Elaine.

1093
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:08,936
I am sorry.

1094
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:11,482
I am keeping you from the ball.

1095
01:02:13,475 --> 01:02:14,262
Goodnight.

1096
01:02:31,753 --> 01:02:32,425
Hello?

1097
01:02:33,087 --> 01:02:34,608
Circle 1-6-3-3.

1098
01:02:38,457 --> 01:02:39,651
Hotel Metropole?

1099
01:02:40,092 --> 01:02:41,191
Mr Darricott please.

1100
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:43,116
Yes. Mr James Darricott.

1101
01:03:08,744 --> 01:03:10,551
Norma.
- Darling. What's happened?

1102
01:03:10,973 --> 01:03:14,371
I'm sorry I had to phone you to come
here but I couldn't very well go to you.

1103
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:17,353
I understand, dear. I came as
soon as I could. What is it?

1104
01:03:20,161 --> 01:03:22,381
Mrs Fendley phoned me a few minutes ago.

1105
01:03:24,276 --> 01:03:25,978
She had just had a
talk with her husband.

1106
01:03:27,417 --> 01:03:28,981
She thinks that he knows about ..

1107
01:03:30,005 --> 01:03:30,843
Everything.

1108
01:03:33,225 --> 01:03:33,946
Well?

1109
01:03:35,986 --> 01:03:37,423
Can't you see what that means?

1110
01:03:38,709 --> 01:03:41,477
It will be one of the nastiest scandals
that New York has seen in years.

1111
01:03:43,506 --> 01:03:44,436
Are you afraid?

1112
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:47,136
Yes I am.

1113
01:03:48,111 --> 01:03:48,992
For you.

1114
01:03:49,726 --> 01:03:52,209
You'll be a target for every
dirty mind in New York.

1115
01:03:53,488 --> 01:03:55,052
Norma, I cannot let you in for that.

1116
01:03:56,000 --> 01:03:58,133
I can't let your name
be linked with mine.

1117
01:03:58,919 --> 01:04:00,442
I can't expect you to ..

1118
01:04:01,957 --> 01:04:02,801
To marry me.

1119
01:04:04,729 --> 01:04:05,509
But.

1120
01:04:06,466 --> 01:04:08,214
We still love each other. Don't we?

1121
01:04:13,262 --> 01:04:14,199
My darling.

1122
01:04:14,837 --> 01:04:18,049
If anything happens to you nobody
is going to keep me out of it.

1123
01:04:18,762 --> 01:04:20,581
What happens to you happens to me.

1124
01:04:21,601 --> 01:04:23,189
There's no-one who can hurt me, Jamie.

1125
01:04:23,737 --> 01:04:24,600
Except you.

1126
01:04:25,437 --> 01:04:26,624
There is nothing I want.

1127
01:04:27,140 --> 01:04:28,070
Except you.

1128
01:04:29,295 --> 01:04:30,763
If you still love me?

1129
01:04:32,700 --> 01:04:34,116
More than anything in the world.

1130
01:04:35,785 --> 01:04:37,901
Well. That's all that matters then.

1131
01:04:48,707 --> 01:04:50,299
I expected to find you alone.

1132
01:04:55,167 --> 01:04:56,171
How do you do.

1133
01:04:56,634 --> 01:04:57,833
I think I had better go.

1134
01:04:58,421 --> 01:04:59,007
No.

1135
01:04:59,882 --> 01:05:00,733
Please stay.

1136
01:05:01,047 --> 01:05:04,114
I have something to discuss with you
that does not concern Miss Page.

1137
01:05:05,352 --> 01:05:06,396
You must know that.

1138
01:05:07,432 --> 01:05:09,048
But I've something to tell you, Elaine.

1139
01:05:09,682 --> 01:05:11,373
I had hoped to tell it to you under ..

1140
01:05:12,246 --> 01:05:13,433
Different circumstances.

1141
01:05:14,622 --> 01:05:16,222
But I feel it best to tell you now.

1142
01:05:17,601 --> 01:05:18,617
Miss Page and I ..

1143
01:05:19,604 --> 01:05:20,812
Are going to be married.

1144
01:05:24,226 --> 01:05:25,307
I don't believe you.

1145
01:05:25,724 --> 01:05:26,396
Jamie.

1146
01:05:28,053 --> 01:05:29,240
You can't do this to me.

1147
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,653
You .. you cannot humiliate
me before the whole town.

1148
01:05:34,373 --> 01:05:36,226
I've no intention of
humiliating you, Elaine.

1149
01:05:37,334 --> 01:05:38,045
Oh.

1150
01:05:43,976 --> 01:05:44,877
Goodbye, dear.

1151
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:54,006
Goodbye, dear.

1152
01:05:54,722 --> 01:05:55,770
Just this once.

1153
01:05:56,692 --> 01:05:58,435
And then it will never be goodbye again.

1154
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:04,247
Darling.

1155
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:31,140
What else could I expect
from a ladies' man?

1156
01:06:32,647 --> 01:06:34,164
The ladies' man is dead.

1157
01:06:35,722 --> 01:06:37,293
My Potemkin.

1158
01:06:42,212 --> 01:06:44,940
And I was worried about you
because I thought Horace knew.

1159
01:06:48,940 --> 01:06:49,703
Well.

1160
01:06:50,865 --> 01:06:51,976
If he does know.

1161
01:06:53,349 --> 01:06:54,393
He will divorce me.

1162
01:06:55,481 --> 01:06:56,802
And you will marry me.

1163
01:06:57,884 --> 01:06:59,844
Make no mistake about that.

1164
01:07:01,477 --> 01:07:03,173
You are going to marry me.

1165
01:07:04,732 --> 01:07:06,707
You are not going to marry that girl.

1166
01:07:08,579 --> 01:07:10,018
Before you do.

1167
01:07:11,196 --> 01:07:12,264
I will kill you.

1168
01:07:13,601 --> 01:07:14,640
Good evening.

1169
01:07:19,672 --> 01:07:21,187
Good evening, Mr Darricott.

1170
01:07:21,478 --> 01:07:22,267
Horace.

1171
01:07:23,360 --> 01:07:25,440
Your guests are waiting for you, Elaine.

1172
01:07:26,171 --> 01:07:28,030
The Grand March is about to begin.

1173
01:07:28,518 --> 01:07:30,691
But I can't go without Mr Darricott.

1174
01:07:31,044 --> 01:07:32,299
You will please go.

1175
01:07:32,935 --> 01:07:33,679
Now.

1176
01:07:53,761 --> 01:07:55,940
And to what do I owe
the honor of this visit?

1177
01:08:06,979 --> 01:08:07,707
These.

1178
01:08:09,228 --> 01:08:10,251
Don't worry.

1179
01:08:10,942 --> 01:08:12,722
I know you didn't steal them.

1180
01:08:14,110 --> 01:08:16,210
I am fully aware that my wife ..

1181
01:08:17,828 --> 01:08:19,041
Gave them to you.

1182
01:08:22,311 --> 01:08:23,701
Mr Darricott please.

1183
01:08:25,330 --> 01:08:29,049
I believe I heard my wife say just
now that she would kill you.

1184
01:08:31,607 --> 01:08:33,201
She didn't know what she was saying.

1185
01:08:33,389 --> 01:08:35,867
She knew perfectly well
what she was saying.

1186
01:08:36,519 --> 01:08:37,776
She was mistaken.

1187
01:08:40,480 --> 01:08:43,654
I am going to spare her that .. trouble.

1188
01:08:47,563 --> 01:08:49,893
Don't bother to answer that.

1189
01:08:51,987 --> 01:08:53,927
I can conceive of nothing.

1190
01:08:54,416 --> 01:08:55,486
Mister Darricott.

1191
01:08:56,228 --> 01:08:58,406
That could come to you
over the telephone ..

1192
01:08:58,789 --> 01:09:00,588
That would be of importance to you.

1193
01:09:01,691 --> 01:09:02,399
Now.

1194
01:09:11,466 --> 01:09:12,876
There you are, my dear.

1195
01:09:13,064 --> 01:09:14,826
So sorry to have kept you waiting.

1196
01:09:15,564 --> 01:09:18,701
Such a lovely party, Mrs Fendley.
- Do you think so, my dear?

1197
01:09:19,175 --> 01:09:21,340
It's almost time to
start the Grand March.

1198
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:24,088
We'll start it just as soon as
Mr Darricott comes down.

1199
01:09:24,429 --> 01:09:25,759
He will only be a moment.

1200
01:09:26,111 --> 01:09:27,745
He is .. he's detained.

1201
01:09:31,363 --> 01:09:33,008
You really mean to go through with this?

1202
01:09:33,252 --> 01:09:34,627
If I don't kill you.

1203
01:09:35,392 --> 01:09:36,536
My wife will.

1204
01:09:36,906 --> 01:09:38,430
My wife or Rachel.

1205
01:09:40,509 --> 01:09:42,114
You see, Mr Darricott.

1206
01:09:43,422 --> 01:09:46,833
I know a good deal more
about you than you think I do.

1207
01:09:48,410 --> 01:09:49,654
Yes. Please try him again.

1208
01:09:51,616 --> 01:09:52,463
Mr Fendley.

1209
01:09:53,667 --> 01:09:55,180
I am not going to beg for my life.

1210
01:09:56,437 --> 01:09:58,482
You may be thoroughly
justified in killing me.

1211
01:10:00,673 --> 01:10:01,927
I only want to say that ..

1212
01:10:03,343 --> 01:10:04,523
Not only for me.

1213
01:10:06,034 --> 01:10:06,978
But for you.

1214
01:10:07,874 --> 01:10:10,291
You may be making a great .. mistake.

1215
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:35,637
So that's your game, is it?

1216
01:10:56,029 --> 01:10:57,591
There's a fight up there.
- Where?

1217
01:10:57,863 --> 01:10:59,823
Up there on the balcony.
There's two men fighting.

1218
01:11:30,584 --> 01:11:31,823
Is Mr Darricott here yet?

1219
01:11:32,270 --> 01:11:33,772
No. That's who they're waiting for.

1220
01:11:34,096 --> 01:11:35,304
Oh? Thank you.

1221
01:12:31,223 --> 01:12:32,594
But, Mr Fendley.

1222
01:12:33,098 --> 01:12:34,384
That is, we ..

1223
01:12:34,825 --> 01:12:36,562
I will lead The Grand March.

1224
01:12:37,028 --> 01:12:38,139
With Mrs Fendley.

1225
01:12:38,674 --> 01:12:41,874
Mr Darricott has found
it impossible to appear.

1226
01:12:42,727 --> 01:12:43,629
Horace. You ..

1227
01:12:44,233 --> 01:12:46,047
You have ..?
- We had better start.

1228
01:13:20,279 --> 01:13:21,816
Stand back now. Stand back.

1229
01:13:49,627 --> 01:13:50,757
Has anything happened?

1230
01:13:51,206 --> 01:13:51,964
Plenty.

1231
01:13:54,753 --> 01:13:55,735
Mr Darricott?

1232
01:13:56,249 --> 01:13:57,667
Jamie Darricott himself.

1233
01:14:09,449 --> 01:14:10,093
Look.

1234
01:14:11,035 --> 01:14:12,649
That guy in the street clothes.

1235
01:14:29,633 --> 01:14:30,336
Wait.

1236
01:14:31,546 --> 01:14:32,711
Let him have his fun.

1237
01:14:33,852 --> 01:14:34,875
He can't get away.

1238
01:14:46,759 --> 01:14:48,261
What's the matter with you, sister?

1239
01:14:50,138 --> 01:14:51,497
Were you in love with him too?

1240
01:14:59,522 --> 01:15:00,337
