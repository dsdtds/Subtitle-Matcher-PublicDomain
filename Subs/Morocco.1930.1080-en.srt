1
00:03:30,127 --> 00:03:32,119
<i>Compagnie, halte!</i>

2
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,454
<i>Compagnie, halte! Halte!</i>

3
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:38,549
- <i>Repos surplace!
- Repos surplace.</i>

4
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:40,881
Whew.

5
00:03:40,971 --> 00:03:43,839
Now listen here, fatheads.

6
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:49,802
We're back home again,
and just because you did a little fighting,

7
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:52,354
I know what you're thinking.

8
00:03:52,441 --> 00:03:55,980
You're thinking, "Well, here comes us.

9
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,356
Foreign Legion.

10
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,313
Each man a hero.

11
00:04:01,408 --> 00:04:04,446
All the booze in the world made for us

12
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,528
and the women thrown in."

13
00:04:07,539 --> 00:04:09,656
Well, you're wrong.

14
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:14,085
This time you're gonna behave yourselves
like gentlemen, even if it kills ya.

15
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,048
Yes, I'm talkin' to you.
You heard what I said.

16
00:05:55,939 --> 00:05:59,432
Why don't you get in that line?
What are you doing with those fingers?

17
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,436
Nothing. Yet.

18
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:05,988
Get in there!

19
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,859
All packed up, sir. Ready to land.

20
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,273
Thank you, John.

21
00:07:50,679 --> 00:07:52,295
There you are.

22
00:07:53,682 --> 00:07:57,221
- I hope I haven't forgotten anything.
<i>- Merci, monsieur.</i>

23
00:07:58,395 --> 00:08:00,011
You are very kind.

24
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:04,018
Your first voyage to Morocco?

25
00:08:07,570 --> 00:08:09,152
Yes.

26
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:12,573
I make the trip quite often.
Perhaps I can be of some service.

27
00:08:12,659 --> 00:08:14,571
I'd be happy to help you.

28
00:08:17,664 --> 00:08:20,077
I won't need any help.

29
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,837
You can always reach me
at this address, mademoiselle.

30
00:08:36,558 --> 00:08:38,299
<i>Merci, monsieur.</i>

31
00:09:22,103 --> 00:09:24,311
- Good evening, Officer.
- Good evening.

32
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,640
Do you know who that woman is?

33
00:09:30,153 --> 00:09:32,236
A vaudeville actress, probably.

34
00:09:35,075 --> 00:09:37,658
Uh, just, uh, how do you know that?

35
00:09:37,744 --> 00:09:39,906
Oh, we carry them every day.

36
00:09:41,039 --> 00:09:43,281
We call them suicide passengers.

37
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,876
One-way tickets. They never return.

38
00:10:36,511 --> 00:10:39,879
Well, the wanderer returns. How are you?

39
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,090
- When did you get back?
- Last night.

40
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:44,766
Alexander, I want you
to meet an old friend of mine.

41
00:10:44,853 --> 00:10:47,516
Monsieur La Bessiere,
citizen of the world.

42
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,972
- Very happy.
- Citizen of the world.

43
00:10:50,692 --> 00:10:52,729
- You're a Frenchman, aren't you?
- Yes.

44
00:10:52,819 --> 00:10:56,108
- Uh, Miss Martin.
- Aren't you the painter La Bessiere?

45
00:10:56,197 --> 00:11:00,191
- I paint when I find the time.
- He has all the time that he needs.

46
00:11:00,285 --> 00:11:03,278
He would be a great painter
if he were not so rich.

47
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,828
Colonel Beauchard.

48
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,576
- Colonel.
- Charmed.

49
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,202
- Won't you join us?
- Please.

50
00:11:08,293 --> 00:11:10,205
I'd love to, but, uh...

51
00:11:10,295 --> 00:11:12,287
Isn't that Caesar and his wife?

52
00:11:13,298 --> 00:11:14,505
Yes.

53
00:11:15,592 --> 00:11:18,084
See you later.

54
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:32,894
Awfully nice to see you in Morocco again.

55
00:11:32,984 --> 00:11:36,227
- I'm very happy to be here, even in this heat.
- Yes, it is hot.

56
00:11:36,321 --> 00:11:38,438
And you, Madame Caesar.

57
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,818
- How have you been?
- I've been lonely.

58
00:11:40,909 --> 00:11:42,400
We've missed you.

59
00:11:42,493 --> 00:11:44,359
I feel greatly flattered.

60
00:11:45,997 --> 00:11:48,740
Your rich friend is very democratic.

61
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,326
He can afford to be.
He's always chosen his own friends.

62
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:55,128
Adjutant Caesar was a captain
in the German Air Service

63
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:56,626
before joining the Legion.

64
00:11:56,716 --> 00:11:59,254
Then perhaps you can give me
the history of his wife.

65
00:11:59,344 --> 00:12:02,633
The less said about that the better.

66
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:18,082
The house is packed.

67
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,176
The house is packed.

68
00:13:25,263 --> 00:13:27,425
This is a great night for you.

69
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:31,225
If you make a hit,
you can stay here as long as you like.

70
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,811
Now, you may have heard of me
in Europe or not.

71
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:42,520
My house is patronized
by the finest society in Morocco.

72
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:47,074
Now, what was I going to say?

73
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:50,574
Oh, yes. Pick yourself a protector.

74
00:13:51,331 --> 00:13:53,072
It will give you prestige.

75
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:55,579
An officer in the Legion.

76
00:13:55,668 --> 00:14:00,083
They will tell you that
the officers in the Legion are unimportant,

77
00:14:00,173 --> 00:14:03,086
that the common legionnaire is the thing.

78
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:06,044
They will tell you that private so-and-so

79
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:10,131
is a Russian prince or an ex-general,

80
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,967
that he joined the Legion
to forget his past.

81
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,893
Don't believe it.

82
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:19,815
The private in the Legion is nobody
at 75 centimes per day.

83
00:14:19,901 --> 00:14:21,267
Thank you.

84
00:14:21,361 --> 00:14:23,728
Pick the officers. They have the money.

85
00:14:53,101 --> 00:14:55,889
Ladies and gentlemen.

86
00:14:59,357 --> 00:15:01,724
It is no small task, as you know,

87
00:15:01,818 --> 00:15:05,858
to supply my establishment
with new talent.

88
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:10,863
For some reason,
the artists I engage don't last very long.

89
00:15:10,952 --> 00:15:12,989
It may be the heat. I do my best.

90
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:17,369
I pay the highest wages in Africa.

91
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:21,247
<i>Mille grazie, signore e signori.
Mille grazie.</i>

92
00:15:21,337 --> 00:15:24,250
Anyway, I open the program tonight

93
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,083
with Mademoiselle Amy Jolly, a newcomer,

94
00:15:27,176 --> 00:15:33,468
whom I hope you will receive
with your usual discriminating kindness.

95
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,928
If I remember correctly, Adjutant,

96
00:15:39,021 --> 00:15:42,640
this audience shows
its "usual discriminating kindness"

97
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,645
by receiving its newcomers
rather unpleasantly.

98
00:15:48,865 --> 00:15:53,109
What's the matter? You're late.

99
00:16:00,460 --> 00:16:02,452
All right. Sit down. Go ahead.

100
00:16:36,787 --> 00:16:38,574
Boo! Get off!

101
00:17:00,645 --> 00:17:01,931
Aah!

102
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,875
May I offer you this glass
of champagne, mademoiselle?

103
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:54,043
Thank you.

104
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:57,630
<i>À votre santé!</i>

105
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:22,155
- May I have this?
- Of course.

106
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,594
Sing your number once,
and then sell the apples.

107
00:20:30,688 --> 00:20:33,101
That's the most important thing.
Sell the apples.

108
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:35,523
Ten percent is yours, 90 percent is mine.

109
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,817
You'll make a fortune.

110
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:49,780
Yeah.

111
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,289
<i>- Dame la flor.</i>
- Over my dead body.

112
00:20:56,255 --> 00:20:58,463
<i>Dame la flor o me voy a casa.</i>

113
00:20:59,717 --> 00:21:02,425
Well, what's keepin' ya, baby?

114
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:50,627
We meet once more, monsieur.

115
00:23:50,721 --> 00:23:53,134
I didn't anticipate this pleasure so soon.

116
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,215
Can I also have an apple?

117
00:23:57,144 --> 00:24:00,683
- But I have no change for that.
- I hardly expected you'd have.

118
00:24:01,732 --> 00:24:04,600
You are, again, very kind.

119
00:24:05,569 --> 00:24:10,360
Mademoiselle, may I have the honor
of your company after the performance?

120
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:15,035
I'm sorry. I have disposed
of the balance of the evening.

121
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,828
- Some other time, perhaps?
- Of course.

122
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,458
An apple, sir? Madame?

123
00:24:36,141 --> 00:24:39,475
Don't waste your time down there.
There's no money in the pit.

124
00:24:41,355 --> 00:24:43,972
Isn't there?

125
00:24:59,623 --> 00:25:01,330
Thanks for the flower, mademoiselle.

126
00:25:02,334 --> 00:25:04,747
Can I offer you an apple too?

127
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:08,668
Lend me 20 francs, Barney.

128
00:25:10,968 --> 00:25:13,301
That makes 60.

129
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:19,891
Two weeks' pay
is a lot of money for an apple.

130
00:25:22,104 --> 00:25:25,393
You can have it for nothing, if you like.

131
00:25:25,482 --> 00:25:28,190
Nothing doing.
I always pay for what I get.

132
00:25:39,538 --> 00:25:41,871
I'd sit down if I were you.

133
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:51,922
You are pretty brave.

134
00:25:52,926 --> 00:25:54,633
With women.

135
00:25:57,139 --> 00:25:59,973
- What's the matter? Don't you like brave men?
- Perhaps.

136
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:08,059
Your change...

137
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:11,896
soldier.

138
00:26:49,608 --> 00:26:50,815
Tom!

139
00:26:53,195 --> 00:26:54,982
Hello.

140
00:26:55,072 --> 00:26:57,314
Well, if it isn't Madame Caesar.

141
00:26:58,867 --> 00:27:01,029
Tom, I must see you tonight.

142
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,158
See me tonight?
What if your husband sees you tonight?

143
00:27:04,248 --> 00:27:06,160
He isn't going to see me.

144
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:08,287
Isn't he? What if he does?

145
00:27:09,837 --> 00:27:12,830
Caesar's wife is above suspicion.

146
00:27:13,757 --> 00:27:15,339
Yeah?

147
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:17,087
You may know something
about ancient history,

148
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,260
but I know something about husbands.

149
00:27:20,264 --> 00:27:21,880
Tom.

150
00:28:15,194 --> 00:28:18,062
Oh. It's you.

151
00:28:18,155 --> 00:28:20,863
What's the matter?
Were you expecting someone else?

152
00:28:29,041 --> 00:28:30,452
Can I offer you something?

153
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,374
- Cognac?
- Too hot.

154
00:28:32,461 --> 00:28:33,918
Got any gin?

155
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,162
Yes.

156
00:28:37,299 --> 00:28:39,256
- Cigarette?
- Thanks.

157
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,289
You've made this place look pretty nice.

158
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,288
It looks different now.

159
00:29:14,378 --> 00:29:18,247
How do you know?
Have you been here before?

160
00:29:19,508 --> 00:29:24,048
Well, I've been stationed in this town
for a long time.

161
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,764
Aren't you drinking?

162
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:38,733
No.

163
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,404
Well, <i>salud.</i>

164
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,670
You can smell the desert tonight.

165
00:30:18,442 --> 00:30:19,774
Hot, isn't it?

166
00:30:35,083 --> 00:30:36,369
Faded.

167
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,803
You can go now, soldier.

168
00:30:59,149 --> 00:31:01,641
All right, lady. You won't have
any trouble getting rid of me.

169
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,569
Nothing like independence, is there?

170
00:31:09,785 --> 00:31:12,994
Well, maybe I am independent with women.

171
00:31:25,467 --> 00:31:27,800
You evidently don't think much of women.

172
00:31:30,597 --> 00:31:33,510
I tell you, lady, it's their fault, not mine.

173
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:49,026
Been in the Legion very long?

174
00:31:49,991 --> 00:31:51,607
Almost three years.

175
00:31:53,829 --> 00:31:56,697
Three years? Seems like 300.

176
00:31:58,041 --> 00:32:00,203
You sound tired of life.

177
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:03,036
I don't know whether I am or not.

178
00:32:03,130 --> 00:32:04,996
I was when I joined this outfit.

179
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:10,468
How about you, mademoiselle?
Been on the stage very long?

180
00:32:10,554 --> 00:32:12,295
Long enough.

181
00:32:12,389 --> 00:32:14,130
- Tired of it?
- No.

182
00:32:18,979 --> 00:32:22,268
You've got a lot of pictures with that man.
Your husband?

183
00:32:22,357 --> 00:32:26,476
Husband? I never found
a man good enough for that.

184
00:32:29,406 --> 00:32:32,114
That's just the way I feel about women.

185
00:32:36,705 --> 00:32:38,697
How long ago was that picture taken?

186
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:41,244
Why?

187
00:32:42,335 --> 00:32:44,577
That looks like Russian sable.

188
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:47,584
That coat's worth a load of shekels.
You still got it?

189
00:32:47,674 --> 00:32:51,668
Don't be absurd.
If I still had that coat, I wouldn't be here.

190
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,264
What in the name of 10,000 corporals

191
00:33:01,354 --> 00:33:03,892
did you come to a country
like this for, anyway?

192
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:12,273
I understand that men are never asked
why they enter the Foreign Legion.

193
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:13,731
That's right.

194
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,159
They never asked me,
and if they had I wouldn't have told.

195
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:20,864
When I crashed the Legion,
I ditched the past.

196
00:33:23,627 --> 00:33:26,665
There's a foreign legion of women too.

197
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:39,845
But we have no uniforms, no flags.

198
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,270
And no medals...

199
00:33:47,150 --> 00:33:48,766
when we are brave.

200
00:33:57,869 --> 00:34:01,613
No wound stripes when we are hurt.

201
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,999
Look here.
Is there anything I can do to help you?

202
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,257
No.

203
00:34:14,261 --> 00:34:15,877
I've heard that before.

204
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,096
Or do you think you can
restore my faith in men?

205
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:26,395
Not me.

206
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:29,766
You've got the wrong man for that.

207
00:34:32,696 --> 00:34:35,655
Anybody who has faith in me is a sucker.

208
00:34:46,418 --> 00:34:48,000
You better go now.

209
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:53,464
I'm... beginning to like you.

210
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,029
I've told women
about everything a man can say.

211
00:35:17,115 --> 00:35:20,233
I'm gonna tell you something
I've never told a woman before.

212
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:24,696
I wish I'd met you ten years ago.

213
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,457
- Good night.
- Good night.

214
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:33,958
And thanks.

215
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:41,511
Well, the night's still young.

216
00:35:45,852 --> 00:35:49,141
There's your key, lady.
If I were you, I wouldn't hand it around.

217
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,531
Tom.

218
00:36:59,968 --> 00:37:01,459
I hear something.

219
00:37:14,107 --> 00:37:16,269
Taking a walk?

220
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,146
Out for some fresh air?

221
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:21,479
No. I was looking for you.

222
00:37:21,573 --> 00:37:25,317
It's a good thing you found me.
This quarter isn't safe at night.

223
00:37:25,410 --> 00:37:27,572
I'd better take you home.

224
00:38:06,034 --> 00:38:07,616
A hundred and twenty?

225
00:38:07,702 --> 00:38:10,160
No. I wish I were.

226
00:38:10,246 --> 00:38:15,037
I only feel so light to you
because your arms are so powerful.

227
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:20,004
Well, we're gonna get along
better this time.

228
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:50,241
Look out!

229
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,053
You'd better beat it.
There's gonna be trouble.

230
00:39:35,748 --> 00:39:38,536
I'll give you one more chance.
Who were those two women?

231
00:39:43,006 --> 00:39:45,464
Get your knee outta my hip.

232
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,722
Do you think the two women
you are trying to protect are worth it?

233
00:39:53,683 --> 00:39:55,766
Well, I think one of them is.

234
00:40:09,198 --> 00:40:12,111
<i>Mon adjudant,</i> Monsieur La Bessiere
is here to take you to his club.

235
00:40:12,201 --> 00:40:14,284
Ask him to wait.
I'll be through in a minute.

236
00:40:14,370 --> 00:40:16,282
- No, let him come in.
- Yes, sir.

237
00:40:19,167 --> 00:40:20,783
<i>Entrez, monsieur.</i>

238
00:40:20,877 --> 00:40:23,335
I didn't know that the military
was quite so busy.

239
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:25,128
Oh, yes, we are busy.

240
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:26,876
Sit down.

241
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:31,043
Perhaps you can learn something
about this country

242
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,129
which you think is so marvelous.

243
00:40:36,851 --> 00:40:38,387
Got a match?

244
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,986
This little matter also involves
someone you're interested in.

245
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:50,438
I'm properly curious.

246
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:53,990
Bring in that woman.

247
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,871
Mademoiselle,
I think you know Monsieur La Bessiere.

248
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:05,248
- Very happy to meet you again, mademoiselle.
- Sit down.

249
00:41:05,338 --> 00:41:07,045
I'm happy to meet you again.

250
00:41:22,981 --> 00:41:25,268
Nice of you to have come, mademoiselle.

251
00:41:25,942 --> 00:41:30,061
You were present at this affray
in which the prisoner,

252
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:32,567
with his customary bravery,

253
00:41:32,657 --> 00:41:35,741
severely wounded two helpless natives.

254
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:40,078
Those natives were not helpless.
They attacked us.

255
00:41:47,839 --> 00:41:49,455
Who was the other woman?

256
00:41:49,549 --> 00:41:51,085
I don't know.

257
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:53,592
I'd like to know too.

258
00:41:58,266 --> 00:42:00,053
Uh, do sit down.

259
00:42:05,106 --> 00:42:07,849
The curious part of this is,

260
00:42:07,942 --> 00:42:11,435
I am the only one
that really seems to know

261
00:42:11,529 --> 00:42:13,065
who this other woman...

262
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,238
is.

263
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:19,410
If you do know,
you'd better keep it to yourself.

264
00:42:21,039 --> 00:42:22,996
Careful, Caesar. Don't lose your temper.

265
00:42:24,834 --> 00:42:26,951
Return the prisoner to the guardhouse.

266
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,661
<i>Allez.</i>

267
00:42:41,642 --> 00:42:44,430
I appreciate your attempt...

268
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,524
to keep the name of my wife out of this.

269
00:42:57,158 --> 00:42:58,899
That's all right, sir.

270
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:20,383
You may go now, mademoiselle.

271
00:43:23,726 --> 00:43:25,388
I'll join you in a minute.

272
00:43:39,534 --> 00:43:41,241
You look charming this morning.

273
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:48,536
What will they do to him?

274
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:53,040
I don't know.

275
00:43:57,135 --> 00:44:00,424
Personally, I shouldn't care
to have Adjutant Caesar as an enemy.

276
00:44:03,224 --> 00:44:08,436
I seem to have the unhappy faculty
of causing trouble wherever I go.

277
00:44:08,521 --> 00:44:09,932
Oh, nonsense.

278
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,900
You know, I carry some weight with Caesar.
Possibly I can help you.

279
00:44:17,029 --> 00:44:21,444
Every time a man has helped me,
there's been a price.

280
00:44:22,994 --> 00:44:24,576
What's yours?

281
00:44:25,496 --> 00:44:26,862
My price?

282
00:44:33,713 --> 00:44:35,249
A smile.

283
00:44:49,729 --> 00:44:51,971
I haven't got much more.

284
00:45:06,662 --> 00:45:08,278
Shall we go?

285
00:45:14,795 --> 00:45:17,378
Here you are. There's your pass.
You're a free man.

286
00:45:17,465 --> 00:45:19,707
The door's wide open.
You can do as you like.

287
00:45:19,800 --> 00:45:21,837
Till 7:00 in the morning.

288
00:45:21,928 --> 00:45:25,717
- What's the idea of this?
- You're leaving for Amalfa Pass tomorrow.

289
00:45:25,806 --> 00:45:28,344
Not me. I'm beginning to like this town.

290
00:45:28,434 --> 00:45:31,051
- Tell Caesar I'm not going.
- You tell him yourself.

291
00:45:31,145 --> 00:45:32,932
He's going along this time.

292
00:45:33,022 --> 00:45:34,138
Who's going along?

293
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:37,566
You heard what I said.
Caesar's going along this time.

294
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:43,063
So that's what it is. That's why he didn't
recommend a court-martial.

295
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,572
He's gonna get me out on the road
and face me in the proper direction...

296
00:45:47,662 --> 00:45:51,906
Well, you've got it comin' to ya, haven't ya?
You can't get away with murder all your life.

297
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,412
That's right, Sergeant.
Your argument's perfectly sound.

298
00:45:54,502 --> 00:45:57,119
But nobody's gonna use me
for target practice.

299
00:45:57,213 --> 00:45:59,250
I'm through with the army anyway.

300
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,629
I've been lookin' for the right kind of woman
all my life, and I think I've found her.

301
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:03,959
So I quit.

302
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:08,093
Take this dame and spend a few weeks
somewhere along the blue Mediterranean.

303
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:11,266
So you quit, eh?
Well, nobody's stopping you.

304
00:46:12,144 --> 00:46:16,514
By the way, do you happen to remember
what the penalty is for desertion?

305
00:46:16,607 --> 00:46:20,521
There's a hundred ways of dyin', brother,
and I'm pickin' my own way.

306
00:46:20,611 --> 00:46:22,193
Come on. Get outta here!

307
00:46:59,567 --> 00:47:03,652
He's in there.
I never saw such luck in all my life.

308
00:47:03,738 --> 00:47:05,946
He's rich enough to buy Morocco.

309
00:47:06,032 --> 00:47:08,649
And don't forget me.
You met him in my theater.

310
00:47:13,122 --> 00:47:14,613
Good evening.

311
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:18,367
Your flowers are wonderful.

312
00:47:19,045 --> 00:47:21,128
Any news of him?

313
00:47:21,213 --> 00:47:23,079
I did what I could.

314
00:47:23,174 --> 00:47:25,461
They will not court-martial him.

315
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,925
They're going to transfer him,

316
00:47:28,012 --> 00:47:31,596
which means, of course,
that he will have to leave town.

317
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,449
Do you love him?

318
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:04,121
I don't know.

319
00:48:05,508 --> 00:48:06,624
I hope not.

320
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,292
I can't accept this.

321
00:48:46,382 --> 00:48:47,918
It's worth a fortune.

322
00:48:48,509 --> 00:48:51,001
Anything of less value
would be unworthy of you.

323
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:58,265
I've got to change.

324
00:49:57,077 --> 00:49:59,364
I'd like to take you away from here.

325
00:50:00,456 --> 00:50:01,947
Would you?

326
00:50:05,169 --> 00:50:07,411
Exactly what do you offer now?

327
00:50:08,214 --> 00:50:10,046
The conventional thing.

328
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,295
My offer is highly respectable...

329
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:14,717
marriage.

330
00:50:17,264 --> 00:50:19,756
You're a strange man.

331
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:22,809
Do you find it so strange
that I should be fond of you?

332
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:24,978
Must I answer you now?

333
00:50:25,064 --> 00:50:27,272
I'd sleep better tonight if you did.

334
00:50:30,528 --> 00:50:34,989
I don't think I care to take advantage
of your tempting offer.

335
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,992
- Then you're in love?
- No, I don't think I am.

336
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:43,655
Supposing you had never met
a certain private in the Foreign Legion.

337
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:46,036
What would your answer have been?

338
00:50:47,294 --> 00:50:49,832
Might have been the same. I don't know.

339
00:51:04,812 --> 00:51:08,021
I'm sorry to intrude, but I am leaving
for the Sahara in the morning,

340
00:51:08,107 --> 00:51:10,144
and I just came to say good-bye.

341
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,482
I think you two want to be alone.

342
00:51:19,326 --> 00:51:22,239
I understand you're leaving
on a rather strenuous journey.

343
00:51:22,329 --> 00:51:24,321
May I wish you good luck?

344
00:51:24,415 --> 00:51:25,872
Thanks.

345
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,792
<i>- À bientôt, mademoiselle.
- À bientôt.</i>

346
00:51:39,388 --> 00:51:41,596
Will you be gone long?

347
00:51:41,682 --> 00:51:43,969
When will I see you again?

348
00:51:44,059 --> 00:51:45,550
Maybe never.

349
00:51:45,644 --> 00:51:48,352
Something tells me
I'm not coming back this time.

350
00:51:55,863 --> 00:51:57,354
Don't go.

351
00:51:59,325 --> 00:52:01,533
That's just what I was thinking.

352
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,532
I could desert and board a freighter
for Europe tonight.

353
00:52:13,380 --> 00:52:14,871
Why don't you?

354
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:19,342
I would in a minute if you'd go with me.
Will ya?

355
00:52:28,228 --> 00:52:29,639
Yes.

356
00:52:42,034 --> 00:52:44,401
I'll be back. Wait for me.

357
00:56:30,220 --> 00:56:34,385
If you can spare one of your hands,
I would like to say good-bye too.

358
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,725
- Good-bye, mademoiselle.
- Why didn't you stay last night?

359
00:56:42,441 --> 00:56:44,398
I had a few other calls to make.

360
00:58:19,287 --> 00:58:22,121
- Who are those women?
- Those women?

361
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,119
I would call them the rear guard.

362
00:58:27,087 --> 00:58:29,329
How can they keep pace with the men?

363
00:58:29,423 --> 00:58:32,382
Sometimes they catch up with them,
and sometimes they don't.

364
00:58:33,301 --> 00:58:36,089
And very often when they do,
they find their men dead.

365
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,676
Those women must be mad.

366
00:58:40,726 --> 00:58:42,217
I don't know.

367
00:58:42,978 --> 00:58:45,686
You see, they love their men.

368
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,179
I don't see why we have to
keep gettin' down all day.

369
01:00:43,265 --> 01:00:45,552
We only have to get up again.

370
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:48,635
Anyhow, those walking bed sheets
can't shoot straight.

371
01:00:48,728 --> 01:00:51,687
If you don't like this war,
why don't ya quit?

372
01:00:51,773 --> 01:00:53,935
Anyway,
I thought you were gonna desert.

373
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:58,437
I've turned decent, Sergeant. Decent.

374
01:00:58,530 --> 01:01:00,522
What did you say?

375
01:01:01,575 --> 01:01:03,487
Decent. I'm in love.

376
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:46,029
<i>Garde-à-vous!</i>

377
01:02:10,602 --> 01:02:12,594
You'd better not go in.

378
01:02:13,897 --> 01:02:16,264
- What's wrong, Lo Tinto?
- What's wrong?

379
01:02:16,358 --> 01:02:18,645
She's been drinking like a fish.

380
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:22,103
And don't send any more flowers in pots.

381
01:02:22,197 --> 01:02:24,940
She threw the last one at me an hour ago.

382
01:02:37,337 --> 01:02:38,828
Hello there!

383
01:02:38,922 --> 01:02:40,834
<i>Bonsoir, mademoiselle.</i>

384
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,831
How do you like me now?

385
01:03:19,921 --> 01:03:22,834
You seem gay tonight.
Have you had good news?

386
01:03:22,924 --> 01:03:25,132
Have you heard from Private Brown?

387
01:03:53,038 --> 01:03:55,325
Not badly written for a soldier.

388
01:04:01,713 --> 01:04:03,705
Perhaps it was for the best.

389
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:07,049
Give me a drink.

390
01:04:45,715 --> 01:04:49,550
Call my chauffeur, Lo Tinto.
You're losing your headliner tonight.

391
01:04:49,636 --> 01:04:51,923
Good. I'm not losing anything.

392
01:04:52,013 --> 01:04:54,721
She's been no use to me for three weeks!

393
01:06:33,698 --> 01:06:35,530
<i>Envoyez une patrouille.</i>

394
01:06:39,579 --> 01:06:41,195
Legionnaire Brown.

395
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:47,410
Legionnaire Brown!

396
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,959
Well, I had the right hunch, didn't I?

397
01:06:52,050 --> 01:06:54,633
That's too bad, Brown.

398
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:57,712
Wait a minute.
Give me those 20 francs you owe me.

399
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:13,315
You know, that lady-killer
wasn't a bad soldier at that.

400
01:07:21,079 --> 01:07:23,071
Destroy that machine gun.

401
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:35,753
May I go too, sir?

402
01:09:45,765 --> 01:09:47,722
You're not at all excited.

403
01:09:47,809 --> 01:09:50,847
Reading on the night of our engagement dinner
while we're all waiting for you?

404
01:09:50,937 --> 01:09:52,644
Everybody's here.

405
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:54,471
I didn't think they would come.

406
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:58,149
On the contrary, they're delighted
to witness the unconditional surrender

407
01:09:58,236 --> 01:10:01,070
of the most exacting bachelor
in the world.

408
01:10:22,677 --> 01:10:24,088
I know.

409
01:10:24,178 --> 01:10:27,171
You want to thank me
for making you happy.

410
01:10:27,974 --> 01:10:30,887
You want to thank me for giving you
those pearls this morning.

411
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:34,061
You want to thank me for this
and you want to thank me for that...

412
01:10:37,275 --> 01:10:39,267
Shall we go down now?

413
01:10:57,128 --> 01:10:58,619
Anything wrong?

414
01:10:59,380 --> 01:11:02,589
Caesar was killed.
I received the news this morning.

415
01:11:03,468 --> 01:11:05,084
Oh.

416
01:11:10,558 --> 01:11:13,346
Legionnaire Tom Brown
will probably come back tonight.

417
01:11:14,353 --> 01:11:16,936
Is his company returning?

418
01:11:17,023 --> 01:11:18,605
What's left of it.

419
01:11:21,819 --> 01:11:25,813
You don't need to be concerned
about him, dead or alive.

420
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:29,657
There's still time to tell me.

421
01:11:29,744 --> 01:11:31,906
Do come. They are waiting.

422
01:12:58,374 --> 01:12:59,865
Mohammed.

423
01:13:01,252 --> 01:13:03,995
Pick up those pearls
and take them to my room, please.

424
01:14:56,993 --> 01:14:59,576
Where's Tom Brown? Was he killed?

425
01:14:59,662 --> 01:15:01,995
Not so rough, mademoiselle.

426
01:15:02,081 --> 01:15:04,414
I'm liable to fall apart.

427
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:08,995
We left him at Amalfa.
You can't kill that long drink of water.

428
01:15:10,006 --> 01:15:12,214
Is he badly hurt?

429
01:15:12,299 --> 01:15:15,337
Well, we didn't go down there
for any entertainment.

430
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,337
I gotta get some sleep.

431
01:15:31,986 --> 01:15:36,356
Alexander, don't you think it
unusually hot this month?

432
01:15:37,992 --> 01:15:41,201
No, I don't think so.

433
01:15:42,788 --> 01:15:44,996
Oh, you always disagree with me.

434
01:15:46,042 --> 01:15:49,661
When I came to Morocco as a boy,
it snowed in the summer.

435
01:15:51,422 --> 01:15:54,130
Have you heard that before,
Monsieur La Bessiere?

436
01:15:55,051 --> 01:15:57,543
I wasn't listening, Colonel.
What did you say?

437
01:15:57,636 --> 01:16:00,128
When I came to Morocco as a boy...

438
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:03,174
Uh, what did I say?

439
01:16:03,267 --> 01:16:07,853
When you came to Morocco as a boy,
it rained or... or something.

440
01:16:07,938 --> 01:16:09,554
That was it.

441
01:16:55,486 --> 01:16:58,445
I must go to him.
They left him at Amalfa.

442
01:17:03,369 --> 01:17:05,782
- Is he badly wounded?
- I hope not.

443
01:17:09,625 --> 01:17:11,708
Please don't disturb yourselves.
Sit down.

444
01:17:11,794 --> 01:17:13,786
I don't mind you hearing this.

445
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,583
Why not let me send a telegram
and learn the details?

446
01:17:19,677 --> 01:17:22,044
If his condition is serious,
we can drive down tomorrow.

447
01:17:22,721 --> 01:17:24,678
I'm going now.

448
01:17:33,899 --> 01:17:36,061
Order the car and pack my bag.

449
01:17:48,372 --> 01:17:50,989
You see, I love her.

450
01:17:52,209 --> 01:17:54,371
I'd do anything to make her happy.

451
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,432
Is there a Legionnaire Brown here?

452
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:01,313
Brown?
No, there's no Legionnaire Brown here.

453
01:19:03,405 --> 01:19:05,362
Are you sure?

454
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,032
Well, he might be
under some other name.

455
01:19:08,118 --> 01:19:09,609
Have a look.

456
01:19:55,958 --> 01:19:58,291
Hello, mademoiselle.

457
01:19:58,377 --> 01:20:00,369
What are you doing down here?

458
01:20:02,506 --> 01:20:04,873
I'm looking for Legionnaire Tom Brown.

459
01:20:04,967 --> 01:20:07,004
Oh, you don't find him down here.

460
01:20:07,094 --> 01:20:09,507
<i>Diese verdammte Schweinehund!</i>

461
01:20:09,596 --> 01:20:12,213
He make believe
that he had been hurt very badly.

462
01:20:12,308 --> 01:20:16,177
They find out
and put him in another company.

463
01:20:16,270 --> 01:20:17,761
Is he still in town?

464
01:20:17,855 --> 01:20:20,643
He's around the corner
at the Christine's.

465
01:20:20,733 --> 01:20:23,601
And don't forget to tell him

466
01:20:23,694 --> 01:20:27,563
to pay me the 60 francs that owes me!

467
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:33,215
Who is this girl?

468
01:21:34,306 --> 01:21:36,593
Wouldn't do you any good if I told you.

469
01:21:38,769 --> 01:21:40,852
You love her very much?

470
01:21:42,773 --> 01:21:44,139
Yup.

471
01:21:49,988 --> 01:21:51,650
Poor boy.

472
01:22:55,471 --> 01:22:57,053
<i>¿Es tu novia?</i>

473
01:22:57,139 --> 01:22:58,630
<i>Cállate.</i>

474
01:23:02,978 --> 01:23:05,516
What are you doing
in this part of the world?

475
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:12,943
I heard you were wounded.

476
01:23:13,989 --> 01:23:16,527
Not me. I never felt better in my life.

477
01:23:29,796 --> 01:23:31,537
Are you married?

478
01:23:31,632 --> 01:23:33,123
No.

479
01:23:37,638 --> 01:23:40,255
Why didn't you return
with your company?

480
01:23:47,814 --> 01:23:51,148
Aren't you going to marry
that rich friend of yours?

481
01:23:53,487 --> 01:23:54,978
Of course.

482
01:23:57,407 --> 01:23:59,114
Are you sure?

483
01:24:01,495 --> 01:24:03,908
I don't change my mind.

484
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,714
Well, then I wish you all the luck
in the world, mademoiselle.

485
01:24:21,974 --> 01:24:24,762
<i>Rassemblement!</i>
Back to the barracks!

486
01:24:24,851 --> 01:24:28,265
<i>Antreten. Ihr Schweinehunde, raus!</i>

487
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,163
Gonna be a thirsty march.

488
01:25:08,437 --> 01:25:11,305
Have you lost something?
Can I help you?

489
01:25:12,774 --> 01:25:14,356
Go on. Beat it.

490
01:25:33,045 --> 01:25:35,162
I forgot my knife.

491
01:25:35,255 --> 01:25:37,588
You forgot to say good-bye too.

492
01:25:39,509 --> 01:25:42,673
We leave at dawn.
Come and see us off, will you?

493
01:25:44,890 --> 01:25:46,381
Maybe.

494
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:38,284
Good-bye, mademoiselle.

495
01:27:38,378 --> 01:27:39,869
Good-bye.

496
01:27:41,965 --> 01:27:43,752
Good-bye, sir.

497
01:27:43,842 --> 01:27:45,834
Good luck, Legionnaire Brown.
