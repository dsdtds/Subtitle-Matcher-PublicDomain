00:16:44,159 --> 00:16:47,329
I am I ever get that promotion Wilson

173
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,970

00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:16,400
me feel better along

178
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:20,870
study about normal mycology recognizes paranoia that one of the most dangerous

179
00:17:20,869 --> 00:17:26,168
I container perhaps mister bennett and kemp on the glass by paranoia

180
00:17:26,169 --> 00:17:30,070
you something well a patient suffers from delusions of grandeur

181
00:17:30,069 --> 00:17:34,849
you think he's very important way above those around him he had a superiority

182
00:17:34,849 --> 00:17:35,599
complex

183
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:40,769
that all no also coupled with the persecution mania

184
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:44,019
caused by an intense feeling that everyone began

185
00:17:44,019 --> 00:17:48,058
so far you correct with him explain

186
00:17:48,058 --> 00:17:53,599
why I pretty that like it because the act logically

187
00:17:53,599 --> 00:17:56,668
you didn't study and you would know it was maladjusted

188
00:17:56,669 --> 00:18:00,940
and he doesn't hesitate to use force to assert his personality

189
00:18:00,940 --> 00:18:05,650
this leads to an antisocial conduct then with the Denison

190
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:16,590
AP implied you might even enjoy your life by noon
