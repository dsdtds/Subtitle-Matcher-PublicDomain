1
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,939
CITIZENS
OF PARIS

2
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:24,979
A killer
is among you!

3
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:27,980
A criminal who
strangles young women.

4
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:30,940
Anyone who has information
about this Cyanopogon ...

5
00:02:30,941 --> 00:02:34,300
please contact
the Police immediately!

6
00:02:41,662 --> 00:02:45,741
I am! Why didn't you open
before, when I hit you again?

7
00:02:45,742 --> 00:02:48,541
You scared me, Pol.
What do you want here?

8
00:02:48,542 --> 00:02:51,861
I came to accompany you home.
With Cyanopogon free ...

9
00:02:51,862 --> 00:02:55,262
the streets of Paris
are no longer safe at night.

10
00:02:55,663 --> 00:03:00,302
Donet! The Blue Cane did not catch you
! Where were you;

11
00:03:00,303 --> 00:03:04,062
What are you trying to do?
Are you going to kill me?

12
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:07,303
Constance, it is already
dark outside.

13
00:03:07,304 --> 00:03:12,583
Lucille, will you hurry? Do you want us to
leave and come back alone?

14
00:03:12,584 --> 00:03:15,023
I'm coming, Bamitet.

15
00:03:16,384 --> 00:03:20,063
- You did not have to wait for me.
- Do you hear her?

16
00:03:20,064 --> 00:03:23,784
As if we would not be afraid
of her walking alone at night!

17
00:03:23,785 --> 00:03:27,544
Why do you say
the police did not catch him?

18
00:03:27,545 --> 00:03:31,784
-Whom;
-Whom; Cyanopogonas, of course!

19
00:03:31,785 --> 00:03:35,025
Who else has terrorized
the whole of Paris?

20
00:03:35,026 --> 00:03:39,025
-But yes! I forgot about.
- Come on, I want to go home.

21
00:03:48,307 --> 00:03:51,426
Let's stay close,
for safety.

22
00:04:05,268 --> 00:04:08,507
The puppet, he is!
Hello.

23
00:04:09,148 --> 00:04:12,787
Constance is afraid
of her own shadow.

24
00:04:12,788 --> 00:04:17,508
-When will you play in the park again?
- Probably very soon.

25
00:04:17,509 --> 00:04:20,908
These are my friends,
Constance and Lucille.

26
00:04:20,909 --> 00:04:24,228
- I forget your name.
- Gaston Morel.

27
00:04:24,229 --> 00:04:26,988
I always think of you
simply as the puppet.

28
00:04:26,989 --> 00:04:29,509
You have seen his performances in
the park, of course.

29
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:33,309
- No, I lost it.
-The wonderful operas with dolls?

30
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,589
- They are a lot of fun.
- I would like to see one, someday.

31
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:40,749
I would like it too. I do not show
my puppets much lately.

32
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:45,790
It is difficult to gather people
lately, due to the Cyanopogon.

33
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:49,470
But if you tell me you will come, I will
give a show tomorrow night.

34
00:04:49,471 --> 00:04:52,750
Tomorrow night;
What do you say;

35
00:04:52,751 --> 00:04:55,071
-I ... -Of
course it will!

36
00:04:55,072 --> 00:04:58,271
- He is afraid of Cyanopogon.
- You are not afraid of him?

37
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:04,551
-What to do with me?
- He would find you irresistible.

38
00:05:05,432 --> 00:05:08,592
-Show tomorrow, then?
-At the same place.

39
00:05:08,593 --> 00:05:13,832
-We will come. Right, Lucille?
-Yes. Tomorrow night.

40
00:05:57,236 --> 00:05:59,875
Margarita, convinced that
Faust has abandoned her ...

41
00:05:59,876 --> 00:06:02,996
and being in despair,
having killed her child ...

42
00:06:02,997 --> 00:06:06,236
he finally found the courage
to surrender.

43
00:06:06,237 --> 00:06:09,236
He was tried and
sentenced to prison ...

44
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:13,236
where Faust finds her with
the help of Metastofolis.

45
00:08:26,127 --> 00:08:30,766
Rene, help him show the
puppets to whoever comes back.

46
00:08:30,767 --> 00:08:34,207
I want to raise the money myself , tonight.

47
00:08:55,489 --> 00:08:57,528
Thanks.

48
00:08:57,929 --> 00:09:01,169
-Did you like the show?
-Very much.

49
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,569
Thanks.
I made the puppets myself .

50
00:09:04,570 --> 00:09:08,689
-Did you make the costumes too?
- I designed them. Why;

51
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:11,650
Lucille is a seamstress. It is
natural for her to be interested.

52
00:09:11,651 --> 00:09:13,490
Dressmaker;

53
00:09:13,491 --> 00:09:16,810
Could you make me
some new costumes?

54
00:09:17,971 --> 00:09:21,970
Come back,
let me show you the costumes.

55
00:09:27,412 --> 00:09:29,531
If she was a woman ...

56
00:09:29,532 --> 00:09:33,011
you would not need a rope
to make her talk!

57
00:09:33,012 --> 00:09:36,251
-How do the eyes move?
- This is very simple.

58
00:09:36,252 --> 00:09:38,251
Do you see these
two threads here?

59
00:09:38,252 --> 00:09:41,612
- Do you like my little people?
-Very much.

60
00:09:41,613 --> 00:09:45,852
- They look very real to me.
- Rescues of people I know.

61
00:09:47,693 --> 00:09:50,812
-And Metastofolis?
- Yes, and the bad guy.

62
00:09:50,813 --> 00:09:54,093
And he is also
my manager

63
00:09:54,494 --> 00:09:59,053
-And Margarita? Is she your girlfriend?
-It was.

64
00:10:00,894 --> 00:10:04,693
-It was;
-Unfortunately, it had a tragic end.

65
00:10:07,535 --> 00:10:10,014
It must have been very beautiful.

66
00:10:10,015 --> 00:10:13,134
They said you will show me
how puppets work!

67
00:10:13,135 --> 00:10:17,414
Let's go, until
the world's gone. They will constantly ask.

68
00:10:26,696 --> 00:10:29,495
I can not talk
to so many people around.

69
00:10:29,496 --> 00:10:32,616
With your work, I would expect
a lot of people to like you.

70
00:10:32,617 --> 00:10:34,936
The puppet, you mean?

71
00:10:35,137 --> 00:10:38,456
I prefer to create them,
than to give performances.

72
00:10:38,617 --> 00:10:41,056
you make them
play so well!

73
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:44,216
But there is
something in your voice ...

74
00:10:44,217 --> 00:10:47,297
which made me feel
that you have suffered.

75
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:50,137
- You are very insightful.
-Your Margarita, is she?

76
00:10:50,138 --> 00:10:53,817
-The memory of the tragedy?
-Partially.

77
00:10:53,818 --> 00:10:57,017
But you deliberately keep
the songs alive, right?

78
00:10:57,018 --> 00:11:00,218
If you wanted to forget it,
you would make a new puppet.

79
00:11:00,219 --> 00:11:04,098
One that would remind you of another.
Which may have made you happy.

80
00:11:06,659 --> 00:11:10,218
-Is it difficult to make one?
- It takes time.

81
00:11:10,219 --> 00:11:14,499
-First I make a sketch ...
-Painting? Do you even paint?

82
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:17,859
Enough to have the
result I need.

83
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:22,019
Do you know that you have very beautiful
eyes? Honest eyes.

84
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,980
Will you let me make
a puppet like you?

85
00:11:27,981 --> 00:11:31,420
-Would you like it?
-Very much. Let's see...

86
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:36,220
Are you trying to decide
how to paint me?

87
00:11:39,261 --> 00:11:41,621
I will not paint you.

88
00:11:42,262 --> 00:11:44,141
Lucille!

89
00:11:47,902 --> 00:11:52,421
Better to go with them.
And stay close to them.

90
00:11:53,302 --> 00:11:57,462
Don't you want me to make you
a Margarita costume?

91
00:11:57,503 --> 00:11:59,782
As you wish.

92
00:12:06,904 --> 00:12:08,823
Where is Rene?

93
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:12,263
He is looking for you.
Was it difficult?

94
00:12:12,264 --> 00:12:15,583
As always,
when you avoid it.

95
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:20,424
-If she comes, tell her I'm looking for her.
-What you will not do!

96
00:12:20,825 --> 00:12:23,944
Of course not.
Good night, old man.

97
00:12:24,825 --> 00:12:28,064
-Did you collect anything?
-What;

98
00:12:28,945 --> 00:12:33,424
-Nothing money, you mean?
-For the musicians, you know ...

99
00:12:40,066 --> 00:12:42,705
In the word of my honor!

100
00:13:26,069 --> 00:13:30,309
-Why didn't you stay in the show?
- Can I see you flirting?

101
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:34,109
-Who is she;
-I do not know. A girl.

102
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:38,949
Another one that will take my job
for a few days, weeks!

103
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,830
And then you think you
will come back to me.

104
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:45,270
- Better to leave, now.
-No, not this time!

105
00:13:45,911 --> 00:13:48,070
I will not tolerate it!

106
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:52,350
I warn you.
You will regret this.

107
00:13:52,551 --> 00:13:57,391
From the beginning, I regretted it! From
the first day I met you!

108
00:13:57,392 --> 00:14:00,311
I did not ask
you to fall in love with me.

109
00:14:00,312 --> 00:14:06,431
Then why did you say that I was
necessary for your success?

110
00:14:06,872 --> 00:14:10,712
-What should I believe?
- What did you believe, Rene?

111
00:14:13,753 --> 00:14:19,272
I know all these girls
meant nothing to you.

112
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,633
Because you always
came back to me.

113
00:14:23,634 --> 00:14:26,993
But what happened to Gaston?

114
00:14:28,354 --> 00:14:30,513
You think...

115
00:16:05,961 --> 00:16:10,281
This is the master. Inspector
La Febre, Gaston Morel.

116
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:16,841
-Did you see the corpse?
-It's really Rene.

117
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:22,881
Rene Cremont. He has been singing in
my shows for a year now.

118
00:16:23,763 --> 00:16:27,562
Understood. Sorry, these are
all routine questions.

119
00:16:27,563 --> 00:16:32,642
-How did you understand that he disappeared?
- We would rehearse this morning.

120
00:16:32,643 --> 00:16:35,562
When she did not show up,
I went to her room.

121
00:16:35,563 --> 00:16:38,683
No one answered and I told
the concierge to open it for me.

122
00:16:38,684 --> 00:16:42,283
- Her bed was intact.
-I went again, a while ago ...

123
00:16:42,284 --> 00:16:44,963
but had not appeared.

124
00:16:44,964 --> 00:16:49,163
The porter told me that
another girl was found in the Seine.

125
00:16:49,164 --> 00:16:52,444
Another victim of Cyanopogon.
So I was worried.

126
00:16:52,445 --> 00:16:56,044
Do you know who may have been
motivated to kill her?

127
00:16:56,045 --> 00:17:00,004
I can not think of anyone.
She was always so kind.

128
00:17:02,085 --> 00:17:06,085
-When was the last time you saw her?
-In the show. He left before me.

129
00:17:06,086 --> 00:17:09,365
And you have proof of that.

130
00:17:09,366 --> 00:17:13,525
-Did you see if he left with anyone?
-No.

131
00:17:13,926 --> 00:17:16,805
It always has a lot of people behind,
after the performances.

132
00:17:16,806 --> 00:17:19,886
People come to see
how we shake the ropes.

133
00:17:19,887 --> 00:17:22,606
Renee left,
without realizing it.

134
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:26,686
Did you notice any
unusual type in the viewers?

135
00:17:26,687 --> 00:17:30,606
Sorry, I have no information
that can help you.

136
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,887
We are grateful that
you made the recognition.

137
00:17:32,888 --> 00:17:36,647
I will call you if you
can help in any other way.

138
00:17:44,729 --> 00:17:48,008
Renault, send to alert
Francine Natshang.

139
00:17:48,009 --> 00:17:50,288
To return to Paris
as soon as possible.

140
00:17:50,289 --> 00:17:53,648
- But, inspector ... -
Immediately!

141
00:18:03,890 --> 00:18:06,129
Good Evening.

142
00:18:06,770 --> 00:18:10,049
Did you come to tell me when
we will play Faust again?

143
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:13,970
How to play him, if we do not
find a new Margarita, first?

144
00:18:13,971 --> 00:18:17,570
Miss Renee
is not with us anymore, is she?

145
00:18:18,211 --> 00:18:21,970
What a shame!
He had a nice voice.

146
00:18:22,851 --> 00:18:26,611
-Do you have another in mind?
-No.

147
00:18:26,612 --> 00:18:29,931
I'm thinking of uploading
a new show.

148
00:18:30,852 --> 00:18:35,171
Something from ballet,
with lots of new costumes.

149
00:18:37,012 --> 00:18:39,692
She, what do they call her?

150
00:18:40,573 --> 00:18:44,812
-Prisila Kan.
-Where will I find her?

151
00:18:45,933 --> 00:18:49,012
At
Madame Blanche's dressmaker.

152
00:18:49,013 --> 00:18:51,372
When do you want him to pose for you?

153
00:18:57,534 --> 00:19:00,853
- I will not paint her, she.
-No;

154
00:19:02,214 --> 00:19:06,574
Of course not. I just want him to
make me some costumes.

155
00:19:07,455 --> 00:19:09,814
New, this!

156
00:19:10,935 --> 00:19:13,894
It is a reality,
nothing more.

157
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:18,214
-Just make me costumes.
-In your studio?

158
00:19:18,415 --> 00:19:21,615
I do not know where he will make them.
Not even if he will fix them.

159
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:24,815
- This is what I want you to know.
-Never;

160
00:19:24,816 --> 00:19:27,935
As soon as possible.

161
00:19:31,696 --> 00:19:35,856
Hundreds ..
They are also two of her friends.

162
00:19:35,857 --> 00:19:41,136
- You will exclude them, I imagine.
-Because of my honor.

163
00:19:52,818 --> 00:19:56,217
How do you get in here?
We do not accept beggars!

164
00:19:58,778 --> 00:20:03,378
I did not come here for
business reasons.

165
00:20:03,379 --> 00:20:08,218
I came for a very
confidential mission.

166
00:20:08,219 --> 00:20:13,139
- To see Miss Lucille.
-I am. Did you want me?

167
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:16,179
Particularly.

168
00:20:29,061 --> 00:20:33,740
A gentleman told me to ask
if you would do him a great favor.

169
00:20:33,821 --> 00:20:38,140
-Who;
-Gaston Morel, puppet.

170
00:20:38,141 --> 00:20:40,501
The puppet!

171
00:20:41,142 --> 00:20:45,901
He asks if you will make costumes
for his new puppets.

172
00:20:46,302 --> 00:20:50,621
-With great pleasure! Never;
-Now.

173
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:55,102
-Where is;
- In his studio.

174
00:20:55,743 --> 00:20:58,622
I will come with you immediately.

175
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:04,622
Yes, he has so
many ideas.

176
00:21:04,623 --> 00:21:08,823
No one knows what he
will think next.

177
00:21:11,384 --> 00:21:16,623
I always hope one day,
he makes one like me.

178
00:21:24,705 --> 00:21:26,944
Lucille!

179
00:21:28,065 --> 00:21:30,544
Let me go.

180
00:21:32,145 --> 00:21:34,265
Passed.

181
00:21:52,667 --> 00:21:55,866
- So you work here.
-Yes.

182
00:21:55,907 --> 00:21:58,906
It's perfect.

183
00:22:00,988 --> 00:22:04,107
-Did you make them?
-Yes.

184
00:22:06,468 --> 00:22:10,427
- You are not happy to see me.
- I'm excited.

185
00:22:10,548 --> 00:22:14,668
These are the costumes.
Can you make them?

186
00:22:16,269 --> 00:22:20,868
-He is very well. Did you make them?
-With difficulty. It's seasonal.

187
00:22:22,469 --> 00:22:26,948
-Why so much?
- I will dedicate time to the dolls.

188
00:22:26,989 --> 00:22:30,269
Until now, it was just
a game. A hobby.

189
00:22:30,270 --> 00:22:33,589
-Regarding painting?
-Yes,

190
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,029
- I give up painting.
-Why;

191
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,310
-I have my reasons.
-Of course...

192
00:22:45,711 --> 00:22:50,030
Do you want me to make one, for approval?
Choose whoever you want.

193
00:22:52,831 --> 00:22:54,871
This.

194
00:23:04,632 --> 00:23:07,751
It is obvious that
women's care is missing from here.

195
00:23:07,752 --> 00:23:11,592
- Is the house so dirty?
-Like any bachelor space.

196
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:19,832
- Give me this.
- It is torn.

197
00:23:19,833 --> 00:23:22,913
- I wanted to throw it away.
-Wonderful fabric.

198
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:26,873
- It was my favorite.
-Canadian stitches, needed.

199
00:23:26,874 --> 00:23:30,273
-Throw it.
-It would be criminal!

200
00:23:30,314 --> 00:23:33,673
In a few seconds,
it will be fine.

201
00:23:34,794 --> 00:23:38,034
Why did you decide
not to paint me?

202
00:23:38,115 --> 00:23:41,834
In the park you said you
would make me a doll.

203
00:23:42,035 --> 00:23:46,794
You showed a lot of interest.
Something happened. What;

204
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:51,675
- I can not tell you that.
- Did I say, or did I do something?

205
00:23:54,236 --> 00:23:58,075
Were you disappointed when
you saw me up close?

206
00:23:58,076 --> 00:24:01,475
-Instead.
-Why, then?

207
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:06,916
- You ask a lot of questions.
-Don't you like the questions?

208
00:24:08,077 --> 00:24:11,156
Do you have anything to hide?
Nice!

209
00:24:11,157 --> 00:24:16,437
-If I promise not to ask again?
-You are very charming.

210
00:24:17,078 --> 00:24:21,597
Unlike the ones I have
painted. I wonder...

211
00:24:23,478 --> 00:24:28,437
Να'το. Ready. Now you
can use it again.

212
00:25:04,841 --> 00:25:06,960
What brings you here, Lamonte?

213
00:25:06,961 --> 00:25:10,281
Police found the body
of the last girl.

214
00:25:11,922 --> 00:25:16,361
Why do you keep throwing them
at the Seine and they find them?

215
00:25:16,362 --> 00:25:18,321
You know why.

216
00:25:18,322 --> 00:25:22,601
This is your scariest
passion of all, Gaston!

217
00:25:24,003 --> 00:25:28,122
I paid a lot to get
your paintings from France!

218
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:32,642
You will make enough to
constantly ask me for new ones.

219
00:25:33,763 --> 00:25:37,283
Is that why you came now?
Before you get rid of the last one?

220
00:25:37,484 --> 00:25:41,843
- I sold him, the last one.
- Already?

221
00:25:41,844 --> 00:25:47,283
The Duke of Canner was
looking for something unusual.

222
00:25:47,964 --> 00:25:54,484
-Don't tell me he took it!
- Known for his stinginess.

223
00:25:54,485 --> 00:25:59,364
-Only 5,000 francs, he gave.
-Fool! He always exposes them!

224
00:25:59,565 --> 00:26:02,244
If
anyone recognizes the girl?

225
00:26:02,245 --> 00:26:07,205
Those who go to his exhibitions
will not know such a girl.

226
00:26:07,246 --> 00:26:10,325
They are public exhibitions,
anyone can enter

227
00:26:10,326 --> 00:26:14,205
- Convince him not to expose him.
- This will raise suspicions.

228
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:18,246
Buy it again.
You said he only gave you 5,000.

229
00:26:18,247 --> 00:26:21,326
I do not think she will
want to leave him.

230
00:26:21,327 --> 00:26:25,726
The girl in the painting is one
of the victims of Cyanopogon.

231
00:26:34,768 --> 00:26:38,727
-A victim of Cyanopogon?
-The 4th, to be exact.

232
00:26:39,128 --> 00:26:42,407
-Are you sure?
-Absolutely.

233
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,968
It's shocking!

234
00:26:47,809 --> 00:26:51,928
One of my guards
here noticed the resemblance.

235
00:26:51,929 --> 00:26:56,248
I researched it and there is no
doubt that it is the same girl.

236
00:26:56,409 --> 00:27:01,129
- Terribly unfortunate.
- Luck for us, that you bought it.

237
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:05,849
- I know you will work together.
-Of course, I will do what I can.

238
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:09,329
Thanks.
What do you know about the painter?

239
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:13,690
Nothing. I bought the painting because
it was suggested by the gallery owner.

240
00:27:13,691 --> 00:27:17,130
Although, of course, I recognized
its great value.

241
00:27:17,131 --> 00:27:21,890
-Who was the gallery owner?
- Jean Lamonte. Do you know him?

242
00:27:22,291 --> 00:27:26,371
Hearing, only.
Lamonte ...

243
00:27:26,772 --> 00:27:31,331
-What did he tell you about the painter?
- It was a bit vague, I would say.

244
00:27:31,332 --> 00:27:34,611
It was hinted, however, that he
was someone famous ..

245
00:27:34,612 --> 00:27:38,852
which I created under
the pseudonym Albert Garon.

246
00:27:38,853 --> 00:27:43,772
Lamonte ...
I say pay him a visit.

247
00:27:45,853 --> 00:27:49,012
I do not remember such a painting.

248
00:27:49,893 --> 00:27:54,773
Of course, the Duke buys a lot
of paintings, not all of them from me.

249
00:27:56,374 --> 00:28:00,293
He typically remembers
that he bought it from here.

250
00:28:00,334 --> 00:28:04,413
It was painted
by an Albert Garon.

251
00:28:09,375 --> 00:28:11,854
I do not remember the name.

252
00:28:11,855 --> 00:28:16,134
Strange, because he told me
that he paid him 30,000 francs ...

253
00:28:16,135 --> 00:28:21,055
because you told him that one day
the painter would become famous.

254
00:28:21,696 --> 00:28:24,935
Maybe I had said he was
a very talented painter.

255
00:28:24,936 --> 00:28:29,255
I often bet my judgment
, always successfully.

256
00:28:30,136 --> 00:28:35,456
Do you have any other
paintings by this Albert Garon?

257
00:28:35,617 --> 00:28:38,976
I'm sorry to say that,
but no.

258
00:28:39,017 --> 00:28:45,697
But I have a project of another,
very promising young man.

259
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:51,137
- Maybe I'm interested.
- From here, please.

260
00:28:51,818 --> 00:28:54,137
Thanks.

261
00:28:57,898 --> 00:29:01,098
And he is
at a very reasonable price.

262
00:29:02,499 --> 00:29:08,338
Yes, it is quite good. But not
as impressive as Garon.

263
00:29:08,339 --> 00:29:13,459
Can you find me?
You have something else that I like.

264
00:29:13,900 --> 00:29:20,059
-You will have a file for the table.
-I remembered the painting, finally!

265
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,979
A simple, brunette girl,
on a bizarre background.

266
00:29:23,980 --> 00:29:28,300
- An old man had brought it to me.
-The painter himself?

267
00:29:28,301 --> 00:29:33,100
No, an unknown hawk.
He said he needed money.

268
00:29:33,101 --> 00:29:38,380
-Do you know his name?
- I gave cash. I was not interested.

269
00:29:39,021 --> 00:29:42,101
Do you know from whom
he got the painting?

270
00:29:42,102 --> 00:29:45,581
He only mentioned that he had
been in his family for years.

271
00:29:45,582 --> 00:29:50,781
But why all this interest
in Albert Garon?

272
00:29:51,662 --> 00:29:56,222
I am interested in his work.
Surely you can not find him?

273
00:29:56,223 --> 00:29:59,702
I have no idea
how to locate him.

274
00:30:00,103 --> 00:30:04,782
I'm sorry. I'm afraid we
can not work together, then.

275
00:30:04,783 --> 00:30:09,703
-If I knew where I could find you ... -I might
go again, at some point.

276
00:30:28,825 --> 00:30:31,984
-Francin!
-Lusil!

277
00:30:32,385 --> 00:30:35,945
-My love! When did you come back;
- I just got off the train.

278
00:30:35,946 --> 00:30:40,065
Awful trip! I went in for a bath,
before I showed up at the office!

279
00:30:40,066 --> 00:30:43,345
Do you have to go
to work tonight?

280
00:30:43,346 --> 00:30:48,506
I received a telegram, as if
the whole of Paris was waiting for me!

281
00:30:52,987 --> 00:30:56,706
- Was he with you?
-Who;

282
00:30:57,107 --> 00:31:01,267
- You know who I mean.
- You never say the name.

283
00:31:01,908 --> 00:31:06,787
Jacques! No, he was not with me.
He sent the telegram.

284
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:11,387
It is outrageous!
You are never home, anymore.

285
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:15,908
-This is your position!
-Did you forget our agreement?

286
00:31:15,989 --> 00:31:20,268
I will not get involved in
your work, nor you in mine.

287
00:31:36,510 --> 00:31:40,589
If someone is for me,
they should wait!

288
00:31:47,471 --> 00:31:49,430
Good Evening.

289
00:31:50,071 --> 00:31:53,510
I brought you a little man,
to have as a model.

290
00:31:53,511 --> 00:31:57,871
- Who is it, Lucille?
- A client of mine.

291
00:31:58,072 --> 00:32:03,591
-Since when do you sew for men?
-For puppets, I sew!

292
00:32:04,272 --> 00:32:08,232
- Let it pass, I will not appear.
-My sister, Francine.

293
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:11,632
I'm sorry she's not decent.
I would like to meet her.

294
00:32:11,633 --> 00:32:15,952
- Let it pass. I will not be late.
- You do not go inside?

295
00:32:18,273 --> 00:32:22,273
What's wrong with you; Are you afraid to ..
Good evening.

296
00:32:22,914 --> 00:32:26,073
-Francin, Gaston Morel.
-How are you;

297
00:32:26,074 --> 00:32:29,313
Much better, usually!
I'm leaving in a minute.

298
00:32:29,314 --> 00:32:33,193
I can not stay. I thought
of bringing one, for testing.

299
00:32:33,194 --> 00:32:36,354
Almost all the same
dimensions, they have.

300
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:39,474
Do you want me to make all the
clothes?

301
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:43,074
-With great pleasure.
Forgive me, now.

302
00:32:44,235 --> 00:32:48,114
- I was very happy, miss.
-Similarly.

303
00:32:48,115 --> 00:32:50,395
Good night.

304
00:32:59,916 --> 00:33:02,396
Simply, "customer"?

305
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:05,316
Yes, just a customer.

306
00:33:16,518 --> 00:33:20,037
For the first time I hear
them called "puppets"

307
00:33:20,038 --> 00:33:24,557
-Just accompany the puppet.
-Of course! In order not to break!

308
00:33:26,398 --> 00:33:30,558
He is not ugly. The one who
moves the threads, I mean!

309
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:39,598
You can not imagine how happy I am,
how happy we are all, that you came back.

310
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:42,999
Thank you, Inspector.
Let me introduce you to my sister.

311
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,599
You did not tell me that you have
such a charming sister.

312
00:33:46,600 --> 00:33:49,839
-I am not stupid!
-Nice to meet you.

313
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:55,359
My pleasure. Francine
has told me a lot about you.

314
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:58,400
Gentlemen, you can leave.

315
00:33:58,401 --> 00:34:02,400
Now you have to tell me
about your success.

316
00:34:06,401 --> 00:34:08,560
Sit down.

317
00:34:10,402 --> 00:34:12,361
And you.

318
00:34:14,922 --> 00:34:17,921
Now we can talk.
Tell me everything about you.

319
00:34:17,922 --> 00:34:21,481
I thought you called me for
work. For Cyanopogon.

320
00:34:21,882 --> 00:34:25,762
It's a thorn in my side!
We are not going anywhere.

321
00:34:25,763 --> 00:34:29,362
-What have you done so far?
Here is the complete file.

322
00:34:29,363 --> 00:34:31,442
Read it when you can.

323
00:34:31,443 --> 00:34:34,562
Until recently, I had
identified him as a painter.

324
00:34:34,763 --> 00:34:38,643
But we interrogated every Artistic
Authority in Paris.

325
00:34:38,644 --> 00:34:43,003
Professor Wazang,
even Recomian Down.

326
00:34:43,204 --> 00:34:48,123
And now we are interrogating models.
Nobody knows his technique.

327
00:34:48,524 --> 00:34:51,084
I do not understand.

328
00:34:51,125 --> 00:34:54,964
I have the painting that
the Duke of Canir bought.

329
00:34:54,965 --> 00:34:59,844
But it will be shorter to
show you. Will you come too?

330
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:05,005
- No, go. I will stay.
- It is next door. We are coming immediately.

331
00:35:05,886 --> 00:35:09,445
-Next model.
-Elen Berro.

332
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:12,685
Elise Berro.

333
00:35:25,807 --> 00:35:29,126
Duke of Cannery,
Miss Francine Kahn.

334
00:35:29,287 --> 00:35:34,367
-How are you, Reno?
-Very well thank you.

335
00:35:52,289 --> 00:35:55,488
-Are you an Artist model?
- At Boz Arts.

336
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:02,769
Study this
table, please.

337
00:36:04,370 --> 00:36:08,609
Do you have any idea, who
could have painted it?

338
00:36:11,171 --> 00:36:12,730
No.

339
00:36:12,731 --> 00:36:15,930
You will pay attention
to the characteristic style.

340
00:36:15,931 --> 00:36:19,810
Where do you think
this difference is located?

341
00:36:20,931 --> 00:36:23,970
- In the background.
-Exactly.

342
00:36:23,971 --> 00:36:28,291
Do you know any painter who
uses such a background?

343
00:36:29,412 --> 00:36:32,371
-No.
- The next girl.

344
00:36:32,372 --> 00:36:34,731
Mimi Robert!

345
00:36:36,092 --> 00:36:39,652
And so it goes.
Nobody knows his job.

346
00:36:39,653 --> 00:36:43,972
-If I interrogate Lamonte?
- No, he is already very suspicious.

347
00:36:43,973 --> 00:36:47,732
Lamonte is the gallery owner
who sold him to the Duke.

348
00:36:47,733 --> 00:36:51,973
I suspect he knows the
painter, but I have no proof.

349
00:36:51,974 --> 00:36:55,773
Will you interrogate some,
Inspector? I do it for hours!

350
00:36:55,774 --> 00:36:58,093
Of course, Reno.

351
00:37:02,814 --> 00:37:06,214
You understand that you are not being
tried for a crime.

352
00:37:06,215 --> 00:37:10,894
-This is good!
- We just codify witnesses.

353
00:37:12,255 --> 00:37:17,574
-Are you an artist model?
-Of course. Why are you passing me by?

354
00:37:18,215 --> 00:37:21,095
This is not the issue.

355
00:37:21,256 --> 00:37:23,095
Quiet, in the audience

356
00:37:23,976 --> 00:37:26,935
I have posed for the most
important French painters!

357
00:37:26,936 --> 00:37:30,535
Undoubtedly, we are
only interested in contemporary artists.

358
00:37:30,536 --> 00:37:33,136
And for the most
famous sculptors.

359
00:37:33,137 --> 00:37:36,456
You will know, of course,
Aphrodite of Milos!

360
00:37:37,137 --> 00:37:43,096
Historical masterpiece. But you will
not tell us that you posed for it!

361
00:37:44,977 --> 00:37:46,297
Quiet!

362
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:50,297
I am an exact copy
of its dimensions.

363
00:37:51,418 --> 00:37:54,777
Last time, did you work
as a model?

364
00:37:54,778 --> 00:38:01,218
Not as a model, exactly.
After I retired, I do ...

365
00:38:01,219 --> 00:38:04,778
We do not need to
get into that.

366
00:38:09,259 --> 00:38:14,899
Only one question.
Do you know Albert Garon?

367
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:20,659
-Of course!
-Who is;

368
00:38:20,660 --> 00:38:24,299
-The Blue Cane.
-Look at the table.

369
00:38:26,381 --> 00:38:30,660
Do you have any idea who
the painter might be?

370
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:37,700
-When I posed for Monet ...
-For him, we ask you!

371
00:38:38,141 --> 00:38:39,140
No!

372
00:38:39,141 --> 00:38:41,381
The next model!

373
00:38:49,462 --> 00:38:52,701
Listen up.
I have an idea.

374
00:38:54,063 --> 00:38:57,662
The Duke writes to me that you want
a portrait of your daughter ...

375
00:38:57,663 --> 00:39:01,742
and asks me to help
you find a good painter.

376
00:39:01,743 --> 00:39:05,622
Being strangers here, we turn
to the Duke, who is a relative ...

377
00:39:05,623 --> 00:39:08,863
to guide us
to various things.

378
00:39:08,864 --> 00:39:13,423
-For my dowry, mainly.
-The Duke has great taste.

379
00:39:15,024 --> 00:39:19,383
One of his paintings
caught my attention.

380
00:39:19,384 --> 00:39:24,184
The portrait of a girl
with an unexpected background.

381
00:39:25,065 --> 00:39:28,544
I was wondering if this
painter is available.

382
00:39:28,545 --> 00:39:33,945
-What did the Duke say about the painting?
- We could not ask him.

383
00:39:34,346 --> 00:39:38,425
Last night, we came. Just
before leaving for a trip, out of town.

384
00:39:38,426 --> 00:39:41,905
And since we are leaving again for
South America before he returns ...

385
00:39:41,906 --> 00:39:47,226
we said very little personally and
I told him I wanted a portrait.

386
00:39:47,227 --> 00:39:52,666
-What was the name of the painter?
- He could not see very well.

387
00:39:54,067 --> 00:39:58,986
-Karof, or Karon?
-Garon?

388
00:39:58,987 --> 00:40:04,867
Probably. Whoever it is, it
colors the flesh exceptionally.

389
00:40:04,868 --> 00:40:09,027
This was what made me
decide that he is the ideal ...

390
00:40:09,028 --> 00:40:12,867
to capture the subtle
beauty of my daughter.

391
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,268
Father, please!

392
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:22,028
Unfortunately, I do not know the
painter you mentioned.

393
00:40:22,469 --> 00:40:29,109
For a good supply,
you could spot it.

394
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:32,109
I would not know where to find him.

395
00:40:32,110 --> 00:40:39,269
For a supply of 75,000 francs,
you can place an ad.

396
00:40:53,351 --> 00:40:58,391
-150,000 would be an acceptable amount.
- Agree.

397
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:02,471
Be careful, though. I do not promise
success.

398
00:41:02,632 --> 00:41:07,431
You will try, at least.
Let me give you a deposit.

399
00:41:07,432 --> 00:41:12,192
It is not necessary.
If I find the painter, but ...

400
00:41:12,233 --> 00:41:17,712
and it turns out to be a famous person
who paints under a pseudonym ...

401
00:41:17,753 --> 00:41:20,192
he may not want to
use his name.

402
00:41:20,193 --> 00:41:23,393
I do not care
what name he will paint.

403
00:41:23,394 --> 00:41:26,913
As long as he is the one who made
the portrait that I liked so much.

404
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:31,073
-Good accounts are required.
-It should be done soon, though.

405
00:41:31,194 --> 00:41:35,754
- I want to take him with me.
-I will do my best.

406
00:41:35,795 --> 00:41:41,994
If I have good news, I will contact
you immediately, at Doukas.

407
00:41:42,395 --> 00:41:46,394
We will be infinitely
grateful, Mrs Lamonte.

408
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:33,878
You're! Why didn't you come
through the front door?

409
00:42:33,879 --> 00:42:39,478
If you paid, you could tell me
where to get my house from.

410
00:42:39,879 --> 00:42:42,919
You have removed many of my
paintings in the past.

411
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:45,399
A small profit, I made.

412
00:42:46,040 --> 00:42:51,519
Do you think that I'll continue to
let you live here?

413
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,080
I will pay you.

414
00:43:00,561 --> 00:43:03,760
What; How much do you make
with puppets?

415
00:43:03,761 --> 00:43:06,880
-I'll make it.
- Do not say nonsense.

416
00:43:06,881 --> 00:43:12,361
I will make you a suggestion, though.
25,000 francs, if you accept.

417
00:43:12,762 --> 00:43:16,601
-25,000 -I
may provide you with 30,000.

418
00:43:17,242 --> 00:43:22,281
-With these I would make an amazing show!
-With dozens of puppets!

419
00:43:22,923 --> 00:43:24,762
What is the proposal?

420
00:43:24,763 --> 00:43:28,242
A rich South American
wants a portrait of his daughter.

421
00:43:28,643 --> 00:43:32,322
I imagined it. No, I told you I
stopped painting.

422
00:43:32,323 --> 00:43:36,163
And you can do it,
forever. After that!

423
00:43:36,164 --> 00:43:39,843
Think about it, Gaston!
30,000 francs!

424
00:43:41,924 --> 00:43:44,603
I'm thinking about it.

425
00:43:47,404 --> 00:43:50,444
No, it is very dangerous!

426
00:43:53,525 --> 00:43:56,404
Besides, I told you I would not
paint your girlfriend again!

427
00:43:56,405 --> 00:44:00,804
But this is different.
It is a portrait. It is safe.

428
00:44:00,965 --> 00:44:06,205
She will leave immediately, she is getting married!
And she will take him with her!

429
00:44:10,446 --> 00:44:14,965
-It's a trap!
- Do you think I risked it again?

430
00:44:19,207 --> 00:44:23,206
If there is no risk, why not
paint it in your studio?

431
00:44:23,207 --> 00:44:27,646
In the workshop, above the
store. Makes me paint.

432
00:44:28,087 --> 00:44:33,967
-Yes! So is!
Either there, or I do not paint it!

433
00:44:34,368 --> 00:44:39,367
Okay, Gaston.
Paint it there.

434
00:44:40,728 --> 00:44:45,448
The store will be surrounded.
Every exit will be guarded.

435
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:49,648
But how do we know that
Garon went to Lamonte?

436
00:44:49,649 --> 00:44:54,488
We will signal. He will stand
at the window and light a cigar.

437
00:44:54,889 --> 00:44:57,529
You know the window at the
back of the desk.

438
00:44:57,530 --> 00:45:01,689
Have someone watch
the window, let us know.

439
00:45:01,690 --> 00:45:05,289
Do not enter too soon, though.
Let him start, first.

440
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:08,529
We have to have something
on the canvas, for proof.

441
00:45:08,530 --> 00:45:14,490
Persuade him to show you the background
he intends to use.

442
00:45:14,491 --> 00:45:20,010
I will try. The signal will
mean that it has come and started.

443
00:45:20,011 --> 00:45:23,370
I leave the choice of the
moment to you, Reno.

444
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:27,251
This means, however, that
you are also considered fully responsible.

445
00:45:40,613 --> 00:45:45,332
He also stated that there should
be no visitors.

446
00:45:45,333 --> 00:45:51,493
Not even you, sir. In order
not to risk denial, I accepted.

447
00:45:51,574 --> 00:45:55,813
-Yes, but my daughter ...
-Don't worry about me.

448
00:45:56,214 --> 00:46:00,453
Lamonte will not object
to staying here and smoking.

449
00:46:00,454 --> 00:46:03,533
-Not at all.
-Very well.

450
00:46:03,534 --> 00:46:08,614
But forgive me. I will lead
the lady to our painter.

451
00:46:37,817 --> 00:46:41,736
The painter asked to be able
to work without you seeing him.

452
00:46:41,857 --> 00:46:47,057
He is satisfied with this way.
The senorita has come!

453
00:46:47,498 --> 00:46:50,937
-Are you ready;
- Absolutely.

454
00:46:52,058 --> 00:46:55,577
I hope you are comfortable.
If you want anything ...

455
00:46:55,578 --> 00:46:58,938
as long as you shout from
the communication pipe.

456
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:04,218
The artist feels the
rush and completely agrees.

457
00:47:04,219 --> 00:47:08,418
Therefore,
I will not bother you anymore.

458
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:25,940
You better make me
the pose.

459
00:47:25,941 --> 00:47:30,380
Better on your own. The
result will be more personal.

460
00:47:56,743 --> 00:48:00,422
- You were not late.
- Not much, I hope.

461
00:48:00,823 --> 00:48:04,102
-Was our painter ready?
-Started.

462
00:48:04,503 --> 00:48:08,583
If you do not mind, let
us arrange our outstanding issues.

463
00:48:08,584 --> 00:48:12,583
- I brought the amount you requested.
-The whole amount;

464
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:18,703
-150,000 francs.
-Nice. I will write you a receipt.

465
00:48:23,185 --> 00:48:27,544
You will have made other paintings
besides that of the Duke.

466
00:48:28,665 --> 00:48:30,384
Here you go;

467
00:48:30,545 --> 00:48:34,025
I would like to see some
of your other paintings, I said.

468
00:48:34,026 --> 00:48:37,785
Thanks. Higher
head, please.

469
00:48:50,427 --> 00:48:52,826
Do you have a match?

470
00:49:03,068 --> 00:49:06,707
-Cigar;
-Thanks, I do not smoke.

471
00:49:07,588 --> 00:49:13,227
But I always have matches.
They often prove useful.

472
00:49:27,830 --> 00:49:32,509
I have some antiques, back here,
if you want to see them.

473
00:49:33,150 --> 00:49:37,269
But I would not want
to tempt prying eyes!

474
00:49:41,031 --> 00:49:45,310
I put on a simple dress, to
put an interesting background on me.

475
00:49:45,351 --> 00:49:49,190
I especially liked that one
in the portrait of Doukas.

476
00:49:49,191 --> 00:49:53,510
- Are you doing the same to me?
-I could.

477
00:49:54,672 --> 00:49:57,911
You did not light your cigar.

478
00:49:59,072 --> 00:50:04,991
I smoke a lot lately. And
the statue caught my attention.

479
00:50:05,152 --> 00:50:11,592
Then you would not mind going
to see how the table is progressing.

480
00:50:12,233 --> 00:50:14,712
Please, go.

481
00:50:19,233 --> 00:50:22,513
- I should not ...
- I will tell you when.

482
00:50:23,434 --> 00:50:27,833
Straighten your shoulders!
Not so square!

483
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:32,353
I asked you to help me!
I am incapable of such a thing.

484
00:50:45,035 --> 00:50:49,715
It can not be so difficult
to be yourself!

485
00:50:50,116 --> 00:50:53,635
-What happens;
-Lusil's puppet!

486
00:50:57,196 --> 00:51:01,476
-So you are the Cyanogon!
-Who said it;

487
00:51:01,877 --> 00:51:04,236
Lamonte!

488
00:51:06,317 --> 00:51:10,476
And do you believe what
Lamonte told you?

489
00:51:10,477 --> 00:51:12,676
No!

490
00:52:26,043 --> 00:52:32,962
How many more did you tell that I
made the Duke's paintings?

491
00:52:33,043 --> 00:52:36,163
To nobody!

492
00:52:36,364 --> 00:52:39,323
You are not telling me the truth.

493
00:52:47,204 --> 00:52:52,244
And you try to leave secretly.
You blame me for that too!

494
00:52:52,245 --> 00:52:56,404
I did not do
that!

495
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:06,285
You had arranged
the time, right?

496
00:53:07,646 --> 00:53:10,885
You would have left here
as soon as they entered.

497
00:53:54,969 --> 00:53:56,889
We will enter by force!

498
00:53:57,010 --> 00:54:01,249
Warn others to have
their eyes on fourteen

499
00:54:14,611 --> 00:54:16,650
Break it!

500
00:54:52,854 --> 00:54:55,173
He is finished.

501
00:55:04,455 --> 00:55:06,734
Hot, fast

502
00:55:22,776 --> 00:55:26,975
Yes, his death will certainly
not help us at all!

503
00:55:26,976 --> 00:55:30,695
-Where is Francine?
- He took her out there.

504
00:55:57,978 --> 00:56:01,138
What about him now?

505
00:56:01,219 --> 00:56:05,378
We are no closer to conception
than we were before.

506
00:56:05,379 --> 00:56:09,458
Lamonte was the only one
we had to watch.

507
00:56:10,339 --> 00:56:15,139
Unless I can figure out what
's going on with that necklace.

508
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:20,259
But I went around all the shops
in the city and nothing.

509
00:56:21,380 --> 00:56:25,580
-The necktie?
-Yes, him.

510
00:56:31,741 --> 00:56:36,100
-What happens;
- You say she used him?

511
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,180
Yes, as a stranglehold.

512
00:56:38,181 --> 00:56:41,381
And do you think the owner
is the killer?

513
00:56:41,382 --> 00:56:46,341
Most likely. If not, it will
lead us to the killer.

514
00:56:48,422 --> 00:56:53,622
Lucille, I do not know
how to say that.

515
00:56:54,503 --> 00:56:58,462
But you know how
I felt about Francine.

516
00:56:58,463 --> 00:57:00,902
She was your sister.

517
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:06,703
Believe me, I would do what I
could. And for you.

518
00:57:07,344 --> 00:57:09,583
Thanks.

519
00:57:08,684 --> 00:57:12,883
-Now we have something in common, right?
-Yes.

520
00:57:15,924 --> 00:57:20,044
- Better to go inside.
-Yes please

521
00:57:49,347 --> 00:57:53,506
-My sincere condolences.
- Is this where I patched you?

522
00:57:55,107 --> 00:57:59,706
- Very likely.
-And what happened to the stitches?

523
00:58:00,828 --> 00:58:04,147
Maybe she's not.
I have many of the same.

524
00:58:04,148 --> 00:58:08,827
-A lot;
-Half a dozen. Home, in the drawer.

525
00:58:11,148 --> 00:58:14,468
- Where did you buy them?
- In a shop.

526
00:58:14,469 --> 00:58:17,908
In Place de Glasse.
Why;

527
00:58:17,909 --> 00:58:24,628
I was just wondering. It is a very
unusual fabric for a tie.

528
00:58:25,509 --> 00:58:28,509
Yes, fragile.

529
00:58:30,350 --> 00:58:35,509
-Will you have the kindness?
-Don't you want to go inside?

530
00:58:37,350 --> 00:58:41,990
The living, I'm interested.
I came to mourn you.

531
00:59:25,354 --> 00:59:29,313
-I have to see you. To pass;
-You are welcome.

532
01:00:04,517 --> 01:00:07,716
-Where is the necktie?
-Who;

533
01:00:07,717 --> 01:00:13,236
- The one I mandated to you.
- He ... I threw him.

534
01:00:14,838 --> 01:00:19,597
-I would like to believe you!
- You spent a lot. Have a seat.

535
01:00:23,118 --> 01:00:25,517
Let me
bring you something. A little brandy?

536
01:00:25,518 --> 01:00:27,837
Nothing, thank you.

537
01:00:30,159 --> 01:00:36,518
-Where were you last night?
-Here. I made the puppets.

538
01:00:38,359 --> 01:00:42,679
-All night long;
- I went out for a while.

539
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:49,479
-To paint one?
- I said that I do not paint again!

540
01:00:49,480 --> 01:00:53,839
I thought you just did not want
to paint me. Why;

541
01:00:54,480 --> 01:01:00,680
What substance would I have to tell you?
Whatever I say, I do not believe it.

542
01:01:02,041 --> 01:01:07,760
-Why;
- I had started to like you very much.

543
01:01:08,922 --> 01:01:13,841
- Do you like me?
-Yes. But it was something more.

544
01:01:15,202 --> 01:01:19,961
I felt like I was in love with you.
I really fell in love with you.

545
01:01:20,362 --> 01:01:24,602
Why does this stop
you from painting me?

546
01:01:28,603 --> 01:01:34,682
I want to tell you something
that no one else knows.

547
01:01:35,804 --> 01:01:39,083
Then you may understand
how much I love you ...

548
01:01:39,084 --> 01:01:42,883
and why I do not want
to paint you.

549
01:01:46,644 --> 01:01:51,564
I was a very ambitious young man.
And terribly sensitive.

550
01:01:51,605 --> 01:01:55,844
I almost starved
when I was studying Fine Arts.

551
01:01:57,925 --> 01:02:01,004
I did not mind
physical hunger.

552
01:02:01,005 --> 01:02:03,045
There was something inside me.

553
01:02:03,046 --> 01:02:07,285
An ambition to paint
something that was really worth it!

554
01:02:07,286 --> 01:02:11,245
Something great! I worked
feverishly at Borz Arts ..

555
01:02:11,246 --> 01:02:14,125
but I did not seem
to be going anywhere.

556
01:02:14,126 --> 01:02:16,486
I painted all the models
that came in there ...

557
01:02:16,487 --> 01:02:20,606
but the paintings, one after the
other, came out ordinary.

558
01:02:22,207 --> 01:02:24,806
And then, one night ...

559
01:02:25,927 --> 01:02:30,207
As I was walking back to my attic, I
met a girl.

560
01:02:30,248 --> 01:02:33,567
Collapsed.
I did not know what to do.

561
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:37,847
My attic was close,
so I carried it there.

562
01:02:37,888 --> 01:02:42,207
I took care of her as best I
could. I had little money.

563
01:02:42,208 --> 01:02:47,408
Just for the paints. He needed
food, otherwise he would have died.

564
01:02:49,249 --> 01:02:53,568
Somehow, I was able to
provide her with what she needed.

565
01:02:53,569 --> 01:02:57,169
Until one day, to pass
the time, I started painting it.

566
01:02:57,170 --> 01:03:01,969
Janet Lampo.
That was her name.

567
01:03:01,970 --> 01:03:05,569
Her fever-stricken
eyes had something spiritual.

568
01:03:05,570 --> 01:03:08,609
Something that reminded me
of someone I had seen.

569
01:03:08,610 --> 01:03:13,530
And then I realized that.
Oliya's Daughter!

570
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:19,330
I had seen her grave
and it inspired me.

571
01:03:20,211 --> 01:03:23,210
Then I happened to sell
the painting to Lamonte.

572
01:03:23,211 --> 01:03:27,451
Janet recovered until
one day, without a word ...

573
01:03:27,452 --> 01:03:29,811
disappeared.

574
01:03:30,692 --> 01:03:33,611
Until one night
Lamonte appeared in my attic.

575
01:03:33,612 --> 01:03:38,412
He told me that the Academy
had awarded my painting.

576
01:03:38,413 --> 01:03:41,772
It would be exhibited at the Louvre ...

577
01:03:41,773 --> 01:03:46,212
I too would recommend
for the Legion of Honor.

578
01:03:47,333 --> 01:03:50,332
My job,
at the Louvre!

579
01:03:50,333 --> 01:03:53,653
I almost went crazy,
from my joy!

580
01:03:56,454 --> 01:04:02,533
Of course, I wanted to share
my joy with Janet.

581
01:04:03,454 --> 01:04:06,854
I looked for her,
I looked everywhere.

582
01:04:06,895 --> 01:04:11,054
Eventually, I spotted her
through a dark man.

583
01:04:11,055 --> 01:04:15,454
He gave me the address.
I went there.

584
01:04:17,055 --> 01:04:21,415
Outside her door,
I heard laughter. Terrible laughs!

585
01:04:21,816 --> 01:04:25,895
That was when
I really saw her.

586
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:31,696
He invited me inside.
It was not Janet herself.

587
01:04:36,657 --> 01:04:42,056
This was the real Janet.
A cheap, hateful creature.

588
01:04:42,697 --> 01:04:44,536
He offered me money.

589
01:04:44,537 --> 01:04:48,177
He would consider that he could
repay me with money.

590
01:04:48,178 --> 01:04:51,217
Suddenly, the sight of this
Janet did something to me!

591
01:04:51,218 --> 01:04:54,897
Something that was
terribly outrageous.

592
01:04:58,659 --> 01:05:01,538
I wanted it to stop staining
the image I had created.

593
01:05:01,539 --> 01:05:05,258
To humiliate my work I
thought that would be the end of it all.

594
01:05:05,259 --> 01:05:09,258
But not. Whenever I painted again,
I painted Janet.

595
01:05:09,259 --> 01:05:13,099
I started making puppets
because they were made of wood.

596
01:05:13,100 --> 01:05:17,579
When they became Janet, I could
vent my anger!

597
01:05:22,300 --> 01:05:26,460
Puppets have no money.
Not enough for Lamonte.

598
01:05:26,461 --> 01:05:28,940
And I owed him a
lot of money.

599
01:05:28,941 --> 01:05:31,780
Only he knew
I had killed Janet.

600
01:05:31,781 --> 01:05:33,980
So I had to paint
for Lamonte.

601
01:05:33,981 --> 01:05:36,580
He wanted girls' paintings
that he could sell.

602
01:05:36,581 --> 01:05:39,181
And when all my paintings
ended up in Janet ...

603
01:05:39,182 --> 01:05:42,181
I could not allow it!
I could not stop!

604
01:05:42,182 --> 01:05:46,101
Every time I painted it,
I had to kill it again!

605
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:50,101
After all, life meant
nothing to me. Not even mine.

606
01:05:55,783 --> 01:05:58,582
And then I saw you.

607
01:05:59,703 --> 01:06:03,582
In you, I knew that I found what
was missing from my existence.

608
01:06:03,583 --> 01:06:06,503
What I thought I would find
in Janet and I did not find.

609
01:06:06,504 --> 01:06:08,983
In you, I saw an
opportunity for completion.

610
01:06:08,984 --> 01:06:12,023
I could not relive
my life, to deserve you.

611
01:06:12,024 --> 01:06:14,783
I could not
recall my mistakes.

612
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:17,823
But I could have
avoided further mistakes.

613
01:06:17,864 --> 01:06:20,944
That's why I decided to stop
painting, once and for all.

614
01:06:20,945 --> 01:06:24,344
How for your sake, there should
be no more murders.

615
01:06:24,745 --> 01:06:28,344
That's why I could
not paint you.

616
01:06:28,345 --> 01:06:31,784
-You understand now;
-Yes...

617
01:06:37,706 --> 01:06:40,865
Why Francine?

618
01:06:42,946 --> 01:06:45,745
I did not want to kill her.

619
01:06:46,667 --> 01:06:50,706
I accepted the last job,
because it would mean independence.

620
01:06:51,587 --> 01:06:56,186
There was no possibility of error.
That's why I painted in Lamonte.

621
01:06:56,187 --> 01:07:01,307
When I realized it was
your sister, it was too late.

622
01:07:01,708 --> 01:07:05,827
I only saw that he was coming
between us, you and me.

623
01:07:05,828 --> 01:07:09,747
It destroyed our only
chance for happiness.

624
01:07:10,188 --> 01:07:13,388
Do you think you
can justify her murder?

625
01:07:13,389 --> 01:07:16,868
Anyone who wants to destroy
our happiness is a threat.

626
01:07:16,869 --> 01:07:20,268
A threat that must
come from the middle!

627
01:07:22,829 --> 01:07:26,669
-What are you going to do;
- The only thing I can do.

628
01:07:26,670 --> 01:07:31,109
-Are you thinking of going to the police!
-Why not;

629
01:07:32,470 --> 01:07:36,789
- You would not do that.
-Truth;

630
01:07:38,150 --> 01:07:43,270
You can not
do that to me! Not you, Lucille!

631
01:07:43,271 --> 01:07:48,670
And if you could, I would not let
you turn against me!

632
01:07:58,432 --> 01:08:01,511
Break the door!
Quickly

633
01:08:01,512 --> 01:08:03,951
Stronger!

634
01:08:40,115 --> 01:08:43,394
-How did you get here?
- I followed you.

635
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:47,795
When you looked at the necktie,
I realized you knew something.
