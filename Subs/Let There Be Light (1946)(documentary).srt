1
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,599
<i>The guns are quiet now.</i>

2
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,399
<i>The papers of peace have been signed.</i>

3
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,599
<i>And the oceans of the earth are
filled with ships coming home.</i>

4
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,299
<i>In faraway places, men dreamed of this moment.</i>

5
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:14,200
<i>But for some men, the moment is
very different from the dream.</i>

6
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,199
<i>Here is human salvage...</i>

7
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,900
<i>the final result of all that metal and
fire can do to violate mortal flesh.</i>

8
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:37,099
<i>Some wear the badges of their pain...</i>

9
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:41,899
<i>the crutches, the bandages, the splints.</i>

10
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:47,400
<i>Others show no outward signs,
yet they too are wounded.</i>

11
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:54,399
<i>This hospital is one of the
many for the care and treatment</i>

12
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,800
<i>of the psychoneurotic soldier.</i>

13
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,399
<i>These are the casualties of the spirit...</i>

14
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:24,399
<i>the troubled in mind; men
who are damaged emotionally.</i>

15
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,799
<i>Born and bred in peace, educated to hate war,</i>

16
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:33,199
<i>they were overnight plunged into
sudden and terrible situations.</i>

17
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,999
<i>Every man has his breaking point,</i>

18
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,399
<i>and these, in the fulfillment
of their duties as soldiers,</i>

19
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:43,300
<i>were forced beyond the
limit of human endurance.</i>

20
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,900
At ease, men.

21
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:51,299
On behalf of the commanding officer and
his staff of Mason General Hospital,

22
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,799
I want to extend a hearty welcome to all
of you on your return to the United States.

23
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,700
There's no need to be alarmed at
the presence of these cameras,

24
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,899
as they are making a photographic record

25
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,299
of your progress at this hospital

26
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,699
from the date of admission
to the date of discharge.

27
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:13,399
<i>Here are men who tremble,
men who cannot sleep,</i>

28
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,699
<i>men with pains that are none the less
real because they are of mental origin.</i>

29
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,799
<i>Men who cannot remember.</i>

30
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,699
<i>Paralyzed men whose paralysis
is dictated by the mind.</i>

31
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:30,099
<i>However different the symptoms,
these things they have in common...</i>

32
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,899
<i>unceasing fear and apprehension,
a sense of impending disaster,</i>

33
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,700
<i>a feeling of hopelessness and utter isolation.</i>

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:52,099
- May I have your last name?
- Meishner, sir.

35
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,199
How do you spell that?

36
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,599
M-E-I-S-H-N-E-R...

37
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:57,599
- May I have your last name, please?
- Wulliver.

38
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,600
How do you spell that?

39
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:13,899
<i>The psychiatrists listen to the stories of
the men, who tell them as best they can.</i>

40
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,199
<i>The names and places are different.</i>

41
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:18,499
<i>The circumstances are different.</i>

42
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,999
<i>But through all the stories runs one thread...</i>

43
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,400
<i>death, and the fear of death.</i>

44
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,400
And then after you got wounded what happened?

45
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:37,200
- Same things, only worse?
- Hmm...

46
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:41,399
Seems like my nerves keep getting worse on me.

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,499
- They get worse.
- These airplanes, they bother me.

48
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,799
- I got killed nearly by one of them.
- You nearly got killed.

49
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,299
Where were you at the time?

50
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,699
Saint-Lo, I believe. Somewhere
over there. I don't remember.

51
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,100
What were you... what were you
doing when the planes came over?

52
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,700
I was in a hole.

53
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,899
- Do you know where you are?
- I think I'm in the States now.

54
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,699
They told me I was coming back.

55
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:20,699
But they told me I was going to die.

56
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:27,999
In the hospital I wouldn't eat, hardly.
But I was sick, and I wouldn't eat hardly.

57
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,399
They told me I was going to
die if I didn't eat anyhow.

58
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,899
Told me that they didn't
care whether I died or not.

59
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:41,600
We will see that you don't die. You won't die.

60
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:58,100
I lost my last buddy up there, little Norman.
He was second scout, I was first scout.

61
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,499
They had it all mixed up, up
there. They were shelling us.

62
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,899
- Well, did that make you nervous?
- I... I should... first scout,...

63
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:08,399
I'm first scout, and I should
have been out in front.

64
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,799
And he went out and I started
right after him, and he got shot.

65
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:16,199
And he... he just said, "Oh, Dutch, I'm hit".

66
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,999
He crawled to my feet, and...
I start calling for the medic, and...

67
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,099
I went back to see if I could get
the medic, and there wasn't any.

68
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:28,799
and... I started to go out after him
again, and they wouldn't let me go.

69
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:34,099
And he was the last one of the
original boys that was with me.

70
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:38,699
Him and I were the last two
left out of the original.

71
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:42,099
And when you were shelled, how did you feel?

72
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:47,199
I don't know. I just... after
Norman got hurt, got killed,

73
00:06:47,200 --> 00:06:52,199
why I was all right when we were moving
up or attacking or anything like that.

74
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,699
But when we get pinned down I start
thinking about him laying back there.

75
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,399
And what happened to you when you'd
think about him? How would you feel?

76
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,299
I just didn't care what happened to me.

77
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:07,099
You mean you didn't want to
go back into combat again?

78
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:10,099
Yes, sir, I wanted to go back.
I wanted to stay there.

79
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:17,599
I wanted to keep on for him and all them
other guys, Norm, John, and Stryker...

80
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:20,799
- and Tex, and Pop, and...
- And how do you feel right now?

81
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,800
I feel all right.

82
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:28,199
How have you been getting along?

83
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,099
Well, fairly well, sir.

84
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,699
- You were overseas.
- Yes, sir.

85
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,400
Where?

86
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:36,799
We were in France, and then we went to Germany.

87
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:37,599
Where?

88
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,199
France to Germany.

89
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,399
And what outfit were you with?

90
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:46,000
I was with Headquarters Detachment,
50th Quartermaster Battalion, Mobile.

91
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:48,099
I see you're PFC.

92
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:49,700
At present, sir.

93
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:52,599
- Um... you had to go in the hospital.
- Sir?

94
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,799
You had to go in the hospital.

95
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,099
Twice, sir.

96
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:58,799
It says here on your record from
overseas that you had headaches,

97
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,100
- and that you had crying spells.
- Yes, sir.

98
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,499
- I believe in your profession it's called nostalgia.
- In other words, homesickness.

99
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,799
Yes, sir.

100
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,199
It was induced when shortly before the war

101
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,199
I received a picture of my sweetheart.

102
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,000
Yes?

103
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:30,399
- I'm sorry, I can't continue.
- That's all right.

104
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,599
Griffith, Griffith?

105
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:35,100
- Yes, sir?
- Come on and sit down a minute.

106
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,999
Now...

107
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:42,899
- A display of emotion is all right.
- I'm not doing this deliberately, sir.

108
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,999
- Please believe me.
- Of course you're not, I do believe you.

109
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,899
A display of emotion is sometimes very helpful.

110
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,399
- I hope so, sir.
- Sure... it gets it off your chest.

111
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:56,699
You wouldn't... you wouldn't be here,

112
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:00,399
you wouldn't have been returned as a patient,

113
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:04,599
- if there wasn't something upsetting you.
- Yes, sir.

114
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:06,299
- Well, now, you say had...
- I'm sorry.

115
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,799
- received a letter from your...
- Not a letter, sir.

116
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,899
- A photograph.
- A photograph, yes.

117
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:14,299
Well, what about that, now?

118
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:20,899
Well, sir, to be perfectly honest with you,
I'm very much in love with my sweetheart.

119
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:27,899
She has been the one person that
gave me a sense of importance

120
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:32,399
in that through her cooperation with me,

121
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,300
we were able to surmount so many obstacles.

122
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:39,999
What happened?

123
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,799
Well, when I was in combat, I...

124
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,199
Can you speak louder?

125
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:47,099
- I have trouble hearing you.
- Yes, sir.

126
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:53,899
During the time, I got worried that my brother...

127
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,099
he was killed in Guadalcanal.

128
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,299
What was he, a Marine?

129
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,699
- Yes.
- Now, I notice in this... history here that you...

130
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:05,099
saw a vision of your brother.

131
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:09,599
What... tell me something
about that. What happened?

132
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,799
Oh, I... I guess it was a dream.

133
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,999
Well, describe the dream. What...
what did you see in the dream?

134
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:22,199
I... I dreamt that... I was
home, my brother was home,

135
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,399
and my other brother was home.

136
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,599
We all were home.

137
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:26,999
- All of you were home.
- Sitting around the table.

138
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,999
Everybody was happy, and we were
laughing, you know, talking.

139
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:36,299
Just admiring each other.

140
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:39,399
And then it ended there.

141
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,499
And you could see these images clearly.

142
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:44,899
- Yeah, it was like in a dream, see?
- Yeah. All right.

143
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,099
What about this Mindanao thing
you were telling me about?

144
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:54,299
Well, I... in Mindanao, after I got the news,
I... I... I was... I admit, I was sca... scared.

145
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,399
You were scared.

146
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,799
I... I don't know, I...

147
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:59,499
Sometimes I'd hope something would happen,

148
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,199
- then again I'd say, Well, something did happen.
- What do you mean by "something happen"?

149
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,299
You mean you were hoping that
you'd be wounded and sent back?

150
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,599
- Is that what you mean?
- No.

151
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,899
- What do you mean by that?
- I meant that I... I hoped that just...

152
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,899
you know, I was so disgusted
and tired of everything,

153
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:16,599
I... just... didn't feel like living.

154
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,799
And then I changed my mind,
and I'd think back to my folks,

155
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,099
and it would be a double blow
if something happened to me.

156
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:29,099
And I'd be standing guard, sitting
a machine gun nest, watching.

157
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:33,499
And then I... I'd hear a little
noise, and I'd let go, shoot.

158
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,099
Wasn't nothing, probably. It
was an animal or something.

159
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:37,999
Any noise made you upset, and you'd just shoot.

160
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,100
At that time, yes.

161
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,899
Do you feel worried about anything now?

162
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:46,999
I... I... I don't know. I... I...

163
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,099
Are you mixed up?

164
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,799
Kind of.

165
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,199
What's that pin on your shirt there?

166
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,699
My heart.

167
00:11:55,700 --> 00:11:58,099
Why do you cover those up?

168
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,399
Aren't you proud of them?

169
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,699
Yes, sir.

170
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:05,899
- You got a Purple Heart and campaign ribbons.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:07,399
Well, why are you covering them up?

172
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:10,600
I mean, there must be some
reason for you doing that.

173
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,900
Well, what happened over there?

174
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:19,399
We got in a scrape, and...

175
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:28,899
I was... I was... in the house
there, just got off of guard duty.

176
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:32,899
And it was Friday the 13th, and
I'm sweating it out all day.

177
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:42,499
Patrol came up from town, patrol, and
they shot a panzerfux though the wall.

178
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:47,099
- Well...
- And what?

179
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:55,399
I... I was laying on the couch, and right
before it happened I felt a little jittery, so...

180
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,499
I lay down on the floor.

181
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:03,899
When I... I got up again, the couch was all torn.

182
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,199
In other words, you were
almost killed. Is that it?

183
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:07,599
I... yeah.

184
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,999
It must... must have gone right over my head.

185
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,899
Do you feel conscious... that is,
are you aware of the fact that

186
00:13:13,900 --> 00:13:17,299
you are not the same boy that
you were when you went over?

187
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,599
Do you feel changed?

188
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,199
Yes, sir.

189
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,099
In what way?

190
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,199
I'm more jumpy.

191
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,599
How about with people?

192
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,299
I used to...

193
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,399
I used to always like to have fun.

194
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,999
I used to always be going places.

195
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,800
I don't like to do nothing no more.

196
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,800
How long were you overseas?

197
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:54,999
- 11 months.
- 11 months.

198
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,900
- Were you in any combat at all?
- Just the se... se... second month, sir.

199
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:09,299
I tried every way to keep my mind occupied,
reading, going to the gymnasium, getting...

200
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:16,299
going out with the fellows and trying to become
an extrovert, trying to get out of myself, but...

201
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,599
it seemed to me that I got worse and worse.

202
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,799
And after a while I developed...
after the fear of insanity,

203
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,400
I started developing fears, different sorts.

204
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,499
Did you ever have similar pains...

205
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,299
- before you got...
- Never in my life.

206
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:37,799
- Have you ever been nervous before in your life?
- No, sir. Never. I was a solid man.

207
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:45,600
- Do some noises bother you particularly?
- I just sha... shake a little, but not bad.

208
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,100
Well, I guess I just got tired of
living. You know, put it that way.

209
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:55,199
I have trouble sleeping, yes. Had
dreaming of combat, you know?

210
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:57,799
I just took off, because I...I see

211
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,499
too many of my buddies gone, and
I figured the next one was me.

212
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,300
A man can just stand so much up there, see?

213
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,099
<i>Admission note.</i>

214
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:15,999
<i>Poole, P-O-O-L-E comma Walter L, T5.</i>

<i>Active symptoms in remission.</i>

<i>On this, their first night back in the States,</i>

219
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:37,100
<i>each man who is able may make a
long distance call without cost.</i>

220
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:46,100
<i>After months and years of silence,
familiar voices are heard once again.</i>

221
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:55,099
<i>Then each man makes for himself a small home</i>

222
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:59,100
<i>which will be his for the

223
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:20,099
<i>Now in the darkness of the ward</i>

224
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:22,699
<i>emerge the shapes born of darkness,</i>

225
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:25,299
<i>the terror of things half remembered.</i>

226
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:26,999
<i>Dreams of battle,</i>

227
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:31,900
<i>the torment of uncertainty
and fear and loneliness.</i>

228
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:56,499
<i>The day begins with an early
morning ward inspection.</i>

229
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,900
<i>The medical officer in charge checks
the condition of every man.</i>

230
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:07,599
<i>Modern psychiatry makes no sharp
division between the mind and the body. </i>

231
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:10,899
<i>Physical ills often have psychic causes,</i>

232
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:14,699
<i>just as emotional ills
may have a physical basis.</i>

233
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,499
<i>Possibilities of organic
disturbance in the brain</i>

234
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:22,000
<i>are investigated by means of
the electroencephalograph.</i>

235
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:26,399
<i>The Rorschach Test.</i>

236
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:29,699
<i>The things that the patient's
imagination sees in these cards</i>

237
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:33,600
<i>gives significant clues
to his personality makeup.</i>

238
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:42,300
<i>This looks sort of like a drawing of two women</i>

239
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:48,200
<i>standing on a rock and waving their hands.</i>

240
00:17:57,800 --> 00:18:02,699
<i>This man suffering from a conversion
hysteria requires immediate treatment.</i>

241
00:18:02,700 --> 00:18:08,699
<i>Organically sound, his paralysis is as real
as if were caused by a spinal lesion.</i>

242
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:11,099
<i>But it is purely psychological.</i>

243
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:14,100
Well, just sit up top the middle of the bed there.

244
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,199
I feel pretty good, though.

245
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:19,299
That's fine.

246
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:21,800
Now sit yourself over there.

247
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:31,299
Well, now, can you move over
just a little so I can talk to you?

248
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:31,999
Yes, sir.

249
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,899
Now, what is the trouble? You seem to be upset.

250
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:35,699
Just nervous.

251
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:37,799
- Nervous?
- Yes. It makes me flinch like that.

252
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:41,299
- I see. How long has that been going on?
- Since Friday.

253
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:42,399
- Friday.
- Friday night.

254
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,799
- Come on suddenly or gradually?
- Suddenly, sir.

255
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,099
How?

256
00:18:46,100 --> 00:18:48,999
Well, it started in the
afternoon with crying spells.

257
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,799
And felt something funny in my
shoulders here. Back bothered me.

258
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,199
Just started crying, I lost control of

259
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,099
- my legs and my arms.
- Was there any reason for crying spells?

260
00:18:58,100 --> 00:18:59,799
- I don't know, sir.
- No?

261
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:03,099
- Anything happen at home to bother you?
- Well, my mother's been ill.

262
00:19:03,100 --> 00:19:04,399
- She has been ill?
- That's right.

263
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:05,599
That worry you a lot?

264
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:06,599
Quite a bit.

265
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:09,699
Well, now, has this got anything
to do with your mother's illness?

266
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:11,799
Any reason why you should
have that kind of reaction?

267
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,199
No, sir, not that I know of.

268
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,799
Unless my mother's illness might have
brought this on. I try to hold in, but it hurts.

269
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:19,199
I see. You've just been holding these things in.

270
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,399
That's right, sir.

271
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,599
- No way you can control this at all?
- No, sir.

272
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,199
Well, now, we're going to have
to help you do that, of course.

273
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:29,600
Let's take off this jacket here.

274
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,399
Just slip that off.

275
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,199
All right, now lie down on the bed.

276
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:39,899
Shoes?

277
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:43,999
No, we're leaving the shoes on so you can walk
in them. I think we're going to get you walking.

278
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:46,099
Let's come over here. That's the boy.

279
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:47,399
That's fine.

280
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,499
That's good. Now you lie steady.

281
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,699
Lie steady, that's a boy.

282
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:56,899
This is all going to go away
as I give you this... medicine.

283
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,200
No bother at all.

284
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:05,399
<i>The method employed here is effective
in certain types of acute cases.</i>

285
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:11,500
<i>An intravenous injection of sodium amytal
induces a state similar to hypnosis.</i>

286
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,499
What a torpedo that is.

287
00:20:16,900 --> 00:20:19,299
- You mind if I look this way?
- You look that way.

288
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:20,499
Nothing for you to watch here.

289
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:23,499
But you're going to talk to me as we go along.

290
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:24,699
- Yes, sir.
- That's all.

291
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:27,499
Now, you're not going to
feel much of anything else.

292
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,799
You're going to feel a little bit woozy.

293
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:32,999
<i>The use of this drug serves a twofold purpose.</i>

294
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:36,999
<i>Like hypnosis, it is a shortcut
to the unconscious mind.</i>

295
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,899
<i>As a surgeon probes for a bullet,</i>

296
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:43,099
<i>the psychiatrist explores the
submerged regions of the mind,</i>

297
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,399
<i>attempting to locate and bring to the surface</i>

298
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:49,999
<i>the emotional conflict which is the
cause of the patient's distress.</i>

299
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,499
<i>The second purpose of this drug
is to remove through suggestion</i>

300
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,399
<i>those symptoms which impede
the patient's recovery.</i>

301
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,799
Now tell me a little bit
about what you're thinking of.

302
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,899
- The...
- The thoughts are coming to your mind now.

303
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,299
Nothing in particular.

304
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:07,999
Well, now, let's go back. Let's go back to Friday.

305
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,099
- Friday?
- Yeah, think about that.

306
00:21:10,100 --> 00:21:11,799
Friday.

307
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,699
My mother argues with me.

308
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,800
- Your mother argues with you.
- Yeah.

309
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,399
What does she argue about?

310
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,699
Oh, every little thing. If you sit down in
the wrong chair or something like that.

311
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:25,400
Doesn't like the stuff we get in the store.

312
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,399
Then she calms down.

313
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:30,200
- Well, see, have you always tried to please her?
- Yes.

314
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:33,099
- Always tried to please her.
- I used to clean the house with her when...

315
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,699
- I was smaller.
- Well, now, why do you

316
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:36,099
think she argues like that?

317
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,799
- Because...
- Because she's sick?

318
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:42,200
- Well, she doesn't try to control her temper.
- I see.

319
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:45,599
- How about your father?
- He's a swell guy.

320
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,399
- He's a swell fellow, is he?
- Gets kind of hot tempered.

321
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,000
Since my mother's been sick it's
been costing a lot of money.

322
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:57,099
- And he's lost a lot of weight from worrying.
- I see.

323
00:21:57,100 --> 00:22:00,899
My mother argues with him, she
wants to know where the money is.

324
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,699
But I don't care about that, long
as everything turns out all right.

325
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:07,799
Well, now, this jumping, what
does that make you think of?

326
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,999
Think about it a minute.

327
00:22:09,700 --> 00:22:12,200
I can't help it. It just jumps.

328
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:16,599
How about the legs? Do you know anybody
that had any trouble with their legs like that?

329
00:22:16,600 --> 00:22:19,299
- No, sir. Except...
- What did it make you think of? Go on.

330
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:22,199
Except several... several years ago...

331
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:23,999
...there was one fellow,

332
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:28,399
he had something wrong with his right leg.
Wound in the knee, but he's walking today.

333
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,499
- That hasn't bothered me.
- Was that anything like your leg?

334
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,399
No, he couldn't walk at all.

335
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:35,199
- He couldn't walk at all?
- No.

336
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,999
What do you think of when
you can't walk like that?

337
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:38,699
I wish I could walk.

338
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,199
But what do you think of?

339
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,399
What comes to your mind when
you find that you can't walk?

340
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,999
Just maybe I think my mother and father
should be okay. Sometimes I wonder.

341
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,299
Hope the war ends soon, and things like that.

342
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,599
- I see.
- Nothing in particular.

343
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,299
Mm-hmm. And now the shakes
are gone, now, haven't they?

344
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:56,099
- Yeah.
- How about your legs? They're good and strong.

345
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,099
- They feel all right.
- Move them. Let's raise them.

346
00:22:58,100 --> 00:23:00,899
I was able to raise them before, but I can't walk.

347
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,699
How about them now?

348
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:03,799
They feel all right.

349
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:06,099
They feel good now, as if you
can walk on them, don't they?

350
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:07,299
Toes feel numb.

351
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:09,999
- Toes feel numb, but that's going away, isn't it?
- Yeah.

352
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:13,599
- See? Raising them fine, isn't it?
- Yeah.

353
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,299
Now you're going to be able to walk, aren't you?

354
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,599
I don't know.

355
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,999
- Well, you're going to, aren't you?
- Yes, sir.

356
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,299
All right.

357
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,599
- I'll walk. I like walking.
- You love walking.

358
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,099
Always been very fond of walking.

359
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,199
Now you've found yourself unable to walk.

360
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,899
Now you're going to get
right up and walk, right now.

361
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,000
All right, now let's sit up.

362
00:23:38,600 --> 00:23:41,399
Sit up on the side of the bed. Here you are.

363
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:42,799
That's fine.

364
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:47,099
All right, now stand up. And look at that.

365
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,299
That good?

366
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,499
All right, now walk out here.

367
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:51,199
Walk over to the nurse all by yourself.

368
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,399
That's the boy.

369
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,299
Walk over to the nurse.

370
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,499
You're just a little woozy. That's the
medicine. Now come back to me.

371
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,599
Come back to me. Open
your eyes. That's the boy.

372
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,899
- Isn't that fine, isn't that wonderful?
- Sure.

373
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:05,499
- All right, now again, once more.
- Careful.

374
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,299
- I don't know how long I'm going to be this way.
- Oh, it's going to stay that way.

375
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,499
It's going to stay, because that's
taken care of your worry now.

376
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:14,599
All right, now come on back to me,
and I'm going to let you go to sleep.

377
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:17,399
When you wake up, you'll keep
on walking perfectly well.

378
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:19,099
- How about it?
- Thanks, sir.

379
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,699
Right-o.

380
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:24,500
All right, now let's get up on
here, and we'll go to sleep.

381
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,399
Now, there you go. Now, I'm going
to have you go right to sleep.

382
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,599
When you wake up, it'll be all right.

383
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,499
Thanks.

384
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,199
All right, sleep, Girardi.

385
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:35,299
<i>The fact that he can walk now</i>

386
00:24:35,300 --> 00:24:38,199
<i>does not mean that his neurosis has been cured.</i>

387
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,199
<i>That will require time.</i>

388
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:44,900
<i>But the way has been opened
for the therapy to follow.</i>

389
00:24:47,300 --> 00:24:50,699
<i>Now a new way of living begins,
very different from the old one,</i>

390
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:54,499
<i>whose purpose was killing
and trying not to be killed.</i>

391
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:57,199
<i>Now in an environment of peace and safety,</i>

392
00:24:57,200 --> 00:24:59,499
<i>all the violence behind them,</i>

393
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:02,499
<i>they are building rather than destroying.</i>

394
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:05,499
<i>Men have their choice of occupational therapy.</i>

395
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,999
<i>Some find relaxation in mechanical jobs.</i>

396
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,299
<i>Certain types of cases obtain
relief in precision work,</i>

397
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,799
<i>which answers their inner
need for order and certainty.</i>

398
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:18,599
<i>For sons and daughters and nieces and nephews</i>

399
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:24,400
<i>and neighbors' kids, hobbyhorses
are turned out by the carload.</i>

400
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:32,799
<i>Physical reconditioning is not
the only purpose in sports,</i>

401
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:36,199
<i>which also serve to bring men
out of their emotional isolation</i>

402
00:25:36,200 --> 00:25:39,700
<i>and back into group activity.</i>

403
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,499
<i>One of the most important procedures</i>

404
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:44,999
<i>is group psychotherapy.</i>

405
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,899
<i>Here under the psychiatrist's guidance</i>

406
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:53,099
<i>the patient learns to understand something
of the basic causes of his distress.</i>

407
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:59,499
<i>As one of a group, he also learns to understand
that his inner conflicts are, with variations,</i>

408
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:04,099
- <i>common to all men.</i>
- I think of it a little bit like this.

409
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,299
We want to get you out of
your own feeling of isolation,

410
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:13,699
to get you to feel like
you are like other people.

411
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:20,299
In order to get to that, we have
to use knowledge as one thing,

412
00:26:20,300 --> 00:26:26,499
and something else which has to be added,
and that is an experience of safety.

413
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:32,199
You could say it is almost the core
of all our treatment methods...

414
00:26:32,200 --> 00:26:40,799
development of knowledge of oneself with
the accompanying safety that it brings.

415
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:42,799
I'd like to see if we can get some illustrations

416
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:49,899
of how one's personal safety
would stem from childhood safety,

417
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:56,899
and how the childhood safety itself
would stem from the parents' safety.

418
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:03,199
My illustration, as a child, whenever
I underwent any experiences

419
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,699
that were frightening to me,
I never told my parents.

420
00:27:06,700 --> 00:27:08,399
I kept it to myself.

421
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,799
While I was alone at night
in my room I'd call on God.

422
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:16,499
If I did anything wrong that I was ashamed
of, I was ashamed to go to my parents

423
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:21,299
and tell them what I had
done. So I kept it to myself.

424
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,299
And I used to...

425
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,999
I know I used to be in constant fear that
my parents would find out my feelings.

426
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:32,299
Well, I wonder if there's any of your mother's
troubles that you would know about.

427
00:27:32,300 --> 00:27:40,899
No... uh... my mother... never gave any
of the children any part of her troubles.

428
00:27:40,900 --> 00:27:44,000
Well, that would be the same
thing that happened to you.

429
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:48,899
She didn't tell her troubles,
and you didn't tell yours.

430
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,299
You took your troubles to God, and
she probably did the same thing.

431
00:27:53,300 --> 00:27:56,599
Probably didn't even confide in your father.

432
00:27:56,600 --> 00:28:00,299
In other words, the kind of method that you used

433
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:04,699
to get relief from anxiety
was really, we have to assume,

434
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:09,399
learned and felt right in your
home in the same kind of thing.

435
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,899
I think it was all caused by... uh...

436
00:28:11,900 --> 00:28:13,999
economic conditions in the world.

437
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:18,899
I mean, people trying to comp... compete
with one another, trying to get a better job,

438
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:21,499
trying to keep up with the prices of living.

439
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:24,299
Things like that have caused a
lot of arguments in the home.

440
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,199
Mother and father arguing
about the price of food,

441
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,699
and that has a reflection on
the children, things like that.

442
00:28:29,700 --> 00:28:34,099
- So I think that was one of the causes.
- Was it worse not having enough food to eat,

443
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:36,099
- or the arguments between them?
- Well, both.

444
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:39,399
- I mean, there was...
- Which was the worst, though?

445
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,899
- I guess the arguments.
- Sure they were.

446
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:44,099
- Of course they are.
- Because I can't remember about the food.

447
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,299
There you are.

448
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:47,799
You can't even remember about
the food, and the lack of food.

449
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:51,299
I have in mind my own childhood, where,

450
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:53,499
coming from a moderate family...

451
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:58,899
moderate in the sense that the
family had some sense of security.

452
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:06,399
What happened there was we were told that
we... I mean, myself, my brothers and sisters,

453
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:10,499
we couldn't just play with any of
the kids we wanted to play... with,

454
00:29:10,500 --> 00:29:16,699
Uh... unless their parents in turn had
the equivalent of what our parents had.

455
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:20,299
And as a result, we were kept in a narrow circle,

456
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:21,999
very, very, narrow.

457
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,599
However, I... I have found that
there has been a strong yearning

458
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:30,699
on my part to break out of this environment,

459
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:34,299
to be able to play with Tom, Dick, and Harry.

460
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,799
I say the net result's like this.

461
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:40,399
Your mother did not feel really so superior.

462
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,299
She felt inferior when she tried
to make you take the attitude

463
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:46,499
you were better than the other children,

464
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,499
so that now certain experiences in the Army

465
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:51,299
have brought that out more clearly,

466
00:29:51,300 --> 00:29:54,799
because you've been thrown in
with Tom and Dick and Harry,

467
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:56,999
and need to get along with them.

468
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,899
It's not necessary to be in the Army.

469
00:29:58,900 --> 00:30:01,799
It's not necessary to be in the war.

470
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,499
These kind of troubles have always gone on

471
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:09,599
in all time through all the centuries.

472
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,699
You were going to say something.

473
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,399
I never spoke until I was seven.

474
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,499
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

475
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:19,299
And I stuttered very bad. At 14
and 15 I couldn't recite in school.

476
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,099
Today I'm able to talk.

477
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:27,299
Can you explain how you got started
to talk, how you began to get over that?

478
00:30:28,100 --> 00:30:31,699
During... during the war,
the first word I ever spoke,

479
00:30:32,500 --> 00:30:37,899
Santa Claus had brought me a... a
war gun, and my brother broke it.

480
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:39,399
This is the First World War, yes.

481
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:42,399
- And so I...
- Santa Claus was not in your brother broke it...

482
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:48,999
When I went in to get my gun, I was... I just
said... walked in, "Somebody broke my gun".

483
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,899
That was the first thing I said.

484
00:30:50,900 --> 00:30:53,099
You were angry because someone broke your gun.

485
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:57,799
- So that's the way I started talking.
- I would say all those symptoms,

486
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:01,899
like being unable to speak, stuttering and so on,

487
00:31:01,900 --> 00:31:08,899
they have an underlying anger and resentment
in the deeper parts of the personality.

488
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:10,699
You could almost say it like this.

489
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:17,599
Underneath "I can't" you usually find "I won't".

490
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:21,299
Stuttering on Okinawa, I was
stuttering too, about three weeks.

491
00:31:21,300 --> 00:31:25,599
And... as soon as I came here... I've been
here a month now I stopped stuttering.

492
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,999
You've stopped stuttering completely since...

493
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:29,099
- you came here.
- Yes, sir. Well, that's good.

494
00:31:29,100 --> 00:31:30,699
I don't know whether that's
a tribute to the doctors

495
00:31:30,700 --> 00:31:35,099
- or a tribute to your fundamental health.
- It's due to my fundamental self.

496
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:36,999
No tribute to the doctors at all.

497
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,700
- No, sir.
- Very good.

498
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,599
<i>Some patients require special therapy.</i>

499
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,099
<i>Hypnosis is often effective</i>

500
00:31:46,100 --> 00:31:50,599
<i>in certain types of battle
neuroses, such as amnesia.</i>

501
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,499
<i>This man does not even remember his own name.</i>

502
00:31:53,500 --> 00:31:56,899
<i>A shell burst in Okinawa wiped out his memory.</i>

503
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,699
<i>The experience was unendurable
to his conscious mind,</i>

504
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:03,899
<i>which rejected it, and along
with it, his entire past.</i>

505
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:08,099
<i>Through hypnotic suggestion, the
psychiatrist will attempt to evoke them.</i>

506
00:32:08,100 --> 00:32:12,599
Relax completely, and put
your mind on going to sleep.

507
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:15,199
All right, now, keep your eyes on mine,

508
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:18,699
keep your eyes on mine, and
keep them fixed on mine.

509
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:20,699
Keep your mind entirely on falling asleep.

510
00:32:20,700 --> 00:32:23,199
You're going to go into a deep sleep as we go in.

511
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:27,399
You're going to go into a deep sleep as we
go in. Now clasp your hands in front of you.

512
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,299
Clasp them tight, tight, tight, tight, tight.

513
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:34,399
They're getting tighter and tighter and tighter,
and as they get tighter, you're falling asleep.

514
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:37,999
As they get tighter and you're falling asleep,
your eyes are getting heavy, heavy.

515
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,399
Now your hands are locked tight.

516
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,199
They're locked tight. They're locked tight.

517
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,399
You can't let go.

518
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,899
They're locked tight. You can't let go.

519
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:46,699
When I snap my fingers, you'll be able to let go.

520
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,499
When I snap my finger, you'll be able
to let go, and then you'll get sleepier,

521
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,199
and your eyes are getting heavier.

522
00:32:51,700 --> 00:32:54,699
Now your eyes are getting
heavier, heavier, heavier.

523
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:59,099
You're going into a deep, deep sleep.
You're going into a deep, deep sleep.

524
00:32:59,100 --> 00:33:01,399
Deep asleep, far asleep.

525
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,399
Eyes are now closed tight, closed tight.

526
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,899
Going to a deep, deep sleep.

527
00:33:06,900 --> 00:33:09,299
Deeply relaxed, far asleep.

528
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:11,099
You're far asleep.

529
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,499
You're far asleep.

530
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:14,899
Now you're in a deep sleep.

531
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:16,999
You have no fear, no anxiety.

532
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:18,699
No fear, no anxiety.

533
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:20,999
Now you're in a deep, deep, sleep.

534
00:33:21,500 --> 00:33:23,699
Now just sit down in the chair behind you.

535
00:33:23,700 --> 00:33:25,899
Sit down in the chair behind you.

536
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,299
Lean back.

537
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:32,699
Head now falls forward into a deep, deep sleep.

538
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,299
Head now is falling forward.

539
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,399
You're going further and
further and further asleep.

540
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:39,299
When I stroke, your left arm will become rigid

541
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:44,899
like a bar of steel, and you'll go
further asleep and further asleep.

542
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:49,099
You're falling further and
further and further asleep.

543
00:33:49,100 --> 00:33:50,499
Rigid.

544
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,599
Cannot be bent or relaxed.

545
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,699
When I touch the top of your head,

546
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:58,399
when I touch the top of your
head, that arm will relax,

547
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,799
and the other will become rigid,
and you'll go further asleep.

548
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,800
You'll be in a very deep sleep.

549
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,199
And your sleep is deeper and deeper.

550
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:15,599
Now when I touch this
hand, my finger will be hot.

551
00:34:15,600 --> 00:34:17,599
When I touch this hand, my finger will be hot.

552
00:34:17,600 --> 00:34:19,899
You will not be able to bear it.

553
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:22,799
Your arm is rigid.

554
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:25,699
And now, as I touch your hand,

555
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:27,999
you will no longer feel any pain there.

556
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:30,399
It will be normal.

557
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:34,199
Now the arm is relaxed, and you're
further and further and further asleep.

558
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,899
Now you're deep asleep.

559
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:39,099
We're going back.

560
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,199
We're going back now.

561
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:43,899
Going back to Okinawa.

562
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:46,899
Going back to Okinawa.

563
00:34:46,900 --> 00:34:47,899
You can talk.

564
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,499
You can talk. You can remember everything.

565
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:54,599
You can remember everything.

566
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,799
You're back on Okinawa.

567
00:34:56,300 --> 00:34:58,399
Tell me what you see.

568
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,499
Tell me. Speak.

569
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:02,599
I'm in the battery area.

570
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,799
You're in the battery area.

571
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:08,399
Go on, tell me what's going on.

572
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,199
Getting fire missions.

573
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:12,999
You're getting fire missions.

574
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:17,599
Go on. You see everything now clearly.

575
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:22,199
- Getting shells thrown at us.
- You're getting shells thrown at you.

576
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,299
From where?

577
00:35:23,300 --> 00:35:25,099
- Japs.
- Japs.

578
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:26,499
- Go on.
- Yes.

579
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:27,899
Yes.

580
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,399
Keep on.

581
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,599
You remember it all now.
Every bit of it's coming back.

582
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:39,099
- Japs getting near us to get our position.
- Japs getting near you to get your position.

583
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:41,299
Go on.

584
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:45,299
Told us to get cover.

585
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,599
Who told you to get cover?

586
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:51,299
- BC.
- BC. Go on.

587
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,199
They spotted us.

588
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:59,199
- One of the boys got hurt.
- One of the boys got hurt.

589
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,000
Took him away.

590
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,899
Yes, go on. You remember it now.

591
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:10,699
Tell me. It's all right now, but you can tell me.

592
00:36:10,700 --> 00:36:13,199
You can tell me.

593
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,299
- Explosion.
- Yes.

594
00:36:16,300 --> 00:36:18,899
You remember the explosion now.

595
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:21,599
All right, go on.

596
00:36:22,100 --> 00:36:25,099
- They're carrying me.
- They're carrying you.

597
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,999
Who's carrying you?

598
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,999
I don't know.

599
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,499
Where are they taking you?

600
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:34,799
Carrying me across the field.

601
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,199
Across the field.

602
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,099
Go on.

603
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:42,499
- Put me on a stretcher.
- Yes?

604
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:49,699
- Yes? Go on.
- They're still throw... they're still throwing shells.

605
00:36:49,700 --> 00:36:53,199
- Yes, can you hear them?
- Yes.

606
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,799
You see them?

607
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:58,199
- No.
- All right. Where are they taking you now?

608
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,700
In a truck.

609
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,999
Why are you fearful now?

610
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:09,199
- I want no more of this.
- You don't want any more.

611
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,299
You want to forget it.

612
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,199
But you're going to remember
it, because it's gone now.

613
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:16,199
It's gone.

614
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:17,899
You're back here now.

615
00:37:17,900 --> 00:37:20,899
You're away from Okinawa. You've forgotten it.

616
00:37:20,900 --> 00:37:22,899
But you remember who you are now.

617
00:37:22,900 --> 00:37:24,999
Who are you?

618
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:29,299
- Dali.
- Dali, that's right.

619
00:37:29,300 --> 00:37:31,499
Full name now.

620
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,999
- Dominic Dali.
- Dominic Dali, that's right.

621
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,299
Know your mother's name?

622
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,999
- Isabel.
- That's right.

623
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,399
Father's?

624
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,500
- Salvatore.
- That's fine. You know who they all are now.

625
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:52,199
All right, now you're coming back with us.

626
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:54,099
This is going to stay with you.

627
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:56,699
You're going to remember it all.

628
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:59,099
You're going to remember about Okinawa.

629
00:37:59,100 --> 00:38:03,399
You're going to remember about the
shells and the bombs, but they're gone.

630
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:09,199
You're at ease, you're relaxed.
There's no fear, no anxiety.

631
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:14,399
When I wake you up, you'll be comfortable,
relaxed, no pains, and no aches.

632
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:17,799
But you'll remember all that I've told you,

633
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:21,200
all that you've remembered. You can wake now.

634
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,899
Well, how are you?

635
00:38:31,300 --> 00:38:32,899
Pretty good.

636
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,299
<i>Under the guidance of the psychiatrist,</i>

637
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,199
<i>he is able to regard his experience</i>

638
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:39,899
<i>in its true perspective as a thing of the past,</i>

639
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,499
<i>which no longer threatens his safety.</i>

640
00:38:42,500 --> 00:38:45,700
<i>Now he can remember.</i>

641
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,900
Well, Hofmeister, what's your trouble?

642
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:06,599
It's hard...ha... ha... hard for me to...
get.... get my words... words out.

643
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:10,600
Yeah, it does seem to be a bit tough.
How long have you had that trouble?

644
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:24,000
It... it started a... abo... about a... a...
month... month... month... month ago.

645
00:39:24,600 --> 00:39:26,400
Where were you then?

646
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:33,299
- I was in... France.
- You were in France.

647
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:34,999
Have you been in combat?

648
00:39:35,000 --> 00:39:36,099
Yes.

649
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:40,499
Well, maybe we can help you talk a bit better,
and you can tell me more about it then, right?

650
00:39:40,500 --> 00:39:44,299
Let's lie down and see if
we can't help you on that.

651
00:39:44,300 --> 00:39:46,699
<i>This man is not a chronic stutterer.</i>

652
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:51,599
<i>He suffers from a battle tension
which the drug will attempt to diminish.</i>

653
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,999
<i>Like the man who could not walk
and the man who could not remember,</i>

654
00:39:55,000 --> 00:39:57,900
<i>his illness has an emotional basis.</i>

655
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:05,199
Get all comfortable now, and relaxed. We're
just going to give you some medicine here,

656
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,899
and it's going to help limber
up that tongue of yours.

657
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,600
And this is going to make you feel a bit groggy.

658
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,700
Well, now, tell me now, how do you feel now?

659
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:33,099
- Make any difference in your feeling?
- Boy, and how. It's just like seventh heaven.

660
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,099
What is it?

661
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:39,899
- Tell me about it.
- Boy, I can talk.

662
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:42,399
- That's fine, isn't it?
- I can talk!

663
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,299
- I can talk!
- That's good, boy.

664
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:46,499
Listen, I can talk!

665
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:49,999
Oh, God, listen, I can talk!

666
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:55,499
- Holy Mother of God, listen!
- All right, it's coming back now. Take it easy.

667
00:40:55,500 --> 00:41:00,400
- Oh, listen, I can talk!
- Just the way you always did, isn't that right?

668
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,699
God. Listen.

669
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:07,999
- Oh, God, I can talk.
- Just the way you always did, Hofmeister.

670
00:41:08,000 --> 00:41:09,899
Why don't you try going with it now?

671
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:12,099
- Oh, nice!
- Let's take it easy now.

672
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:14,999
Just talk... just a little lightly now.

673
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,399
Tell me, got any idea why
you couldn't talk before?

674
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,400
What's coming to your mind now?

675
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:25,499
Tell me, what's coming to your mind now?

676
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:29,099
What is it in your mind when you couldn't talk?

677
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,299
What is it that stopped it?

678
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:33,799
Something came through there and stopped it.

679
00:41:33,800 --> 00:41:36,399
What is it, now? Think quickly, think deeply.

680
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:37,499
Let's go back.

681
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:40,499
When was it you lost your speech,
had your trouble talking?

682
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,100
Go back quickly.

683
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:54,499
Seems that I... I first noticed it on a boat.

684
00:41:54,500 --> 00:42:00,599
- On a boat.
- Going over. Uh... it first started with an S.

685
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:03,399
And the fellows laughed at me.

686
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:05,799
I don't know why they laughed,

687
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,999
- until the guy started...
- Well, let's start with that S.

688
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:10,799
Let's go back to that S now.

689
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,799
What were you thinking then?

690
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:15,799
- What was in your mind then?
- Right now?

691
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:16,599
No, then.

692
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,299
On the boat?

693
00:42:17,300 --> 00:42:20,699
Yes, with that S. When you couldn't say S right.

694
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,700
- S.
- Yes.

695
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,999
The port side.

696
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:32,100
- Port side.
- Port side.

697
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,599
Port side of the ship.

698
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:37,699
What side's that?

699
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,499
- That would be the left side.
- Left side,

700
00:42:40,500 --> 00:42:42,700
- that's right.
- Yeah, I remember it.

701
00:42:42,700 --> 00:42:47,399
Because we were out there that
afternoon, and we saw the fishes.

702
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:53,099
And we had some flying fishes.
And I came down, and I said...

703
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:58,299
I was telling the fellow
underneath me about the port...

704
00:42:58,300 --> 00:43:02,900
that I had seen some flying
fishes on the port side.

705
00:43:03,300 --> 00:43:07,999
<i>He tried telling them about the flying
fishes, and he stumbled over the S sound.</i>

706
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:13,299
<i>And the fellows laughed at him. Think hard, S, S.</i>

707
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,899
<i>What does S remind him of?</i>

708
00:43:15,900 --> 00:43:18,799
<i>S, S.</i>

709
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:25,300
<i>He remembers... it is a sound he
fears. A sound of death in combat.</i>

710
00:43:29,500 --> 00:43:33,599
<i>The sound of a German 88 high
explosive shell coming in.</i>

711
00:43:33,600 --> 00:43:38,299
<i>Now it is possible to proceed to the basic
method of psychiatric treatment...</i>

712
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:42,900
<i>discussion and understanding of the
underlying causes of his symptom.</i>

713
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:53,299
<i>As the weeks pass, the therapy
begins to show its effect.</i>

714
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:56,599
<i>The shock and stress of war
are starting to wear off.</i>

715
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:01,399
<i>For these men are blessed with the
naturally regenerative powers of youth.</i>

716
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,599
<i>Now they are living less in the
past and more in the present.</i>

717
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,900
<i>Sometimes they think of the future.</i>

718
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,299
<i>The war years must be put aside,</i>

719
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,899
<i>and the responsibilities of
peace must be considered.</i>

720
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:19,699
<i>A man might open a filling
station, or a hardware store.</i>

721
00:44:19,700 --> 00:44:23,599
<i>Or he can buy a few acres of
land and raise some chickens.</i>

722
00:44:23,600 --> 00:44:26,500
<i>He might even go back to school.</i>

723
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,399
<i>Visitors day.</i>

724
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:41,299
<i>Now the men resume their
contact with the world outside.</i>

725
00:44:41,300 --> 00:44:43,399
<i>These are the people they are coming back to,</i>

726
00:44:43,400 --> 00:44:46,199
<i>whose lives are bound up with theirs.</i>

727
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:47,699
<i>Without their understanding,</i>

728
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,299
<i>all that has been accomplished in the
last few weeks can be torn down.</i>

729
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:56,400
<i>With it, their return to life
can be doubly swift and sure.</i>

730
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:04,699
<i>Classes in group psychotherapy continue.</i>

731
00:45:04,700 --> 00:45:08,199
<i>The men are thinking of
themselves in relation to society.</i>

732
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:11,099
<i>How will they fit into the postwar pattern?</i>

733
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:13,399
<i>How will the world receive them?</i>

734
00:45:13,400 --> 00:45:18,099
You fellows have had an opportunity
to be home with your families

735
00:45:18,100 --> 00:45:21,199
since you've returned from overseas.

736
00:45:21,200 --> 00:45:23,399
Have you noticed any change

737
00:45:23,400 --> 00:45:26,399
in the various members of
your family toward you,

738
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,499
and their reactions toward you?

739
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:31,999
Well, I found out, after four years of absence

740
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:36,499
that it only took me the second
day to be really relaxed,

741
00:45:36,500 --> 00:45:39,299
and I was right chummy again with my dad,

742
00:45:39,300 --> 00:45:44,099
and we talked about the old
neighborhood and the new changes.

743
00:45:44,100 --> 00:45:46,399
I... I don't know. It surprised me.

744
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,199
Do you feel that your family has to be taught

745
00:45:49,200 --> 00:45:51,399
how to treat you when you come back?

746
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:55,299
- No, absolutely not.
- How do you want to be treated by family?

747
00:45:55,300 --> 00:45:58,499
The same I was treated before
I went into the service,

748
00:45:58,500 --> 00:45:59,399
no different.

749
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:01,699
- You don't want to be treated any differently?
- No.

750
00:46:02,100 --> 00:46:07,099
I was talking to one man, and I said, "What
do you think of us fellows that come back

751
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,199
with Psychoneurosis Anxiety State?"

752
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,099
And I says, "You can see that
we're not crazy, by any means".

753
00:46:14,100 --> 00:46:16,799
And he says, "Well, before
I came out here to see you,"

754
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,999
he says, "my first impression
was like in Bellevue".

755
00:46:20,000 --> 00:46:23,399
He said, "The fellows from the last
war there are completely maniacs".

756
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,399
He said, "That was my first impression".

757
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:27,799
And I'm wondering if, I mean,

758
00:46:27,800 --> 00:46:31,199
the great percentage of the people are
going to be like that when we get out.

759
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:34,599
That... that is a common concern

760
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:39,499
among servicemen who have
developed nervous conditions

761
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:41,999
during their stay in the Army,

762
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:45,499
as to what the public is
going to think about them.

763
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:49,999
Undoubtedly there will be people on the outside

764
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,599
who won't have any
understanding of the condition,

765
00:46:52,600 --> 00:46:57,399
who may think of it as being
a rather shameful condition.

766
00:46:57,400 --> 00:46:59,799
That's why we're having an educational program,

767
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:03,299
trying to education the
public into understanding.

768
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:09,699
Unfortunately, most of you fellows have gone
through some very severe stresses in the army,

769
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:16,899
stresses that civilians are rarely subjected to.
In civilian life, you can avoid serious stresses.

770
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:21,899
If a civilian, the average civilian,
were subjected to similar stresses,

771
00:47:21,900 --> 00:47:23,499
he undoubtedly would have developed

772
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:27,299
the same type of nervous condition
that most of you fellows developed.

773
00:47:27,300 --> 00:47:33,799
- All of us have our so-called breaking point.
- And our survey outside showed that

774
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:38,099
civilians on the whole were
more nervous than soldiers.

775
00:47:38,100 --> 00:47:43,099
On Park Avenue, for instance, where
some of your richest people live,

776
00:47:43,100 --> 00:47:48,399
most... most of the patients are people
who suffer from nervous disorders.

777
00:47:48,400 --> 00:47:51,399
And if the doctor won't give them a pill, why,

778
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:53,899
they'll go out and say, "Well,
he's not a good doctor".

779
00:47:53,900 --> 00:47:57,099
So therefore they're given pills,
and they take them at home.

780
00:47:57,100 --> 00:47:59,899
They take these pills at home
because the hospitals are too full.

781
00:47:59,900 --> 00:48:03,999
If the hospitals were empty, they'd
be in a sanitarium or so forth.

782
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,999
Having... uh... been through a
number of these discussions,

783
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:13,699
like the other men have, I know that we have
learned the basis of how we've gotten nervous.

784
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:15,899
Some of us... through combat,

785
00:48:15,900 --> 00:48:18,899
and some of us by not being in combat.

786
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:23,099
And I think... and I'm sure that we have a
better understanding of our conditions,

787
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:27,699
and I'm pretty grateful of being here at Mason
General Hospital, like a lot of fellows are.

788
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:29,799
It just so happens I couldn't walk.

789
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:31,399
And they made me walk.

790
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,599
I couldn't walk when I arrived, and I was
here 24 hours, and they made me walk.

791
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:41,899
I feel pretty grateful for getting my limbs back.
But that's what I'm driving at, is that I know that

792
00:48:41,900 --> 00:48:44,699
when I get out of here, and
the other fellows do too,

793
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:50,099
we're going to try our best to make
ourselves... uh... as best we can.

794
00:48:50,100 --> 00:48:53,599
And... uh... we feel more confident... uh...

795
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,799
to... to grasp this nervous
situation that's come about us,

796
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,399
and we want to show people that we
can do things on our own on the outside,

797
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,499
whether we've been in a hospital for nerves,

798
00:49:02,500 --> 00:49:04,899
uh... or wherever we've been, whether
we've lost an arm or a leg, that

799
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,099
we can be just as good as anybody else.

800
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:12,199
All I want is that they give us a chance to
prove our equality, like they said they were.

801
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:15,399
And I hope they keep their
promise. That's all I hope.

802
00:49:15,700 --> 00:49:19,199
Would you make it a point to tell your employer

803
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,099
that you were a psychoneurotic?

804
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:23,199
Well, if he's an intelligent man,

805
00:49:23,200 --> 00:49:28,099
which most well-known employers
are, that own large concerns,

806
00:49:28,100 --> 00:49:32,199
why he's going to react the same as
any other normal human being would.

807
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:38,799
He's going to say, "It's absolutely plausible, and
the man right now looks all right. I'll try him out".

808
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,199
But you may run into employers

809
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,999
- who are not that broad minded, or intelligent.
- Yes, sir.

810
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,799
And I'll sell myself to them.

811
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:50,899
How about you, Hofmeister? Do you have any
plans about jobs, or do you have any fears

812
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,299
- about getting a job?
- I have no fear whatsoever.

813
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,599
- I've got my job waiting for me, sir.
- You have your job waiting for you.

814
00:49:57,000 --> 00:49:58,799
I think it comes down to this, doesn't it...

815
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:03,899
that... most of you fellows feel that you
ought to be honest with your employer,

816
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:08,299
that you have nothing to hide,
nothing to be ashamed of?

817
00:50:08,300 --> 00:50:09,799
- Isn't that the general attitude?
- Yes, sir.

818
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:11,799
That's the way all the men feel.

819
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:15,199
Your time in the service was not entirely wasted.

820
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:18,299
You have learned a great deal in the service.

821
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:23,299
For instance, a great many jobs and tasks
that you've learned to do in the service

822
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:26,699
that you'll have had absolutely
no contact with in the past.

823
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:29,199
You've also learned to work in groups,

824
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:34,199
something that every soldier learns
to do very early in his military career.

825
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:37,399
This definitely will be of much value to you

826
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:41,000
in your future civilian employment.

827
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,899
<i>The weeks have slipped by fast.</i>

828
00:50:47,900 --> 00:50:51,899
<i> The first strangeness of hospital
life has become routine.</i>

829
00:50:51,900 --> 00:50:54,799
<i>Sometimes a man learns something new.</i>

830
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,600
<i>Deranger always did want to play guitar.</i>

831
00:51:37,800 --> 00:51:40,299
<i>And now the days begin to seem long.</i>

832
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:47,099
<i>There's the old healthy sound of bellyaching
in the air... "Spinach, spinach again".</i>

833
00:51:47,100 --> 00:51:50,599
<i>And, "How about a good movie for a change?"</i>

834
00:51:51,300 --> 00:51:55,199
<i>And, "How about putting some
ice cream in the ice cream soda?"</i>

835
00:51:57,000 --> 00:52:01,199
<i>No longer is a man shut up within
the lonely recesses of himself.</i>

836
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,199
<i>He is breaking out of his prison into life...</i>

837
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:10,399
<i>the life that lies ahead, offering infinite
possibilities for happiness and sorrow.</i>

838
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:16,299
<i>How does a man find happiness?
Is there a secret to discover?</i>

839
00:52:16,300 --> 00:52:21,199
<i>What is the mysterious ingredient
that gives joy and meaning to living?</i>

840
00:52:21,200 --> 00:52:26,299
You know in the Bible where it says,
"Man does not live by bread alone"?

841
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:30,999
Children don't grow up well
without safety and confidence.

842
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:39,799
If that wasn't in one's childhood, in growing up,
you could say, "Now, there's something missing

843
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:42,099
during all that time."

844
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,099
And the next question is how to supply it.

845
00:52:45,100 --> 00:52:48,399
And it does need to be supplied.

846
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:56,299
Not all of the learning in all of the books is
half as valuable in getting over nervousness

847
00:52:56,300 --> 00:53:03,299
as to find someone that you esteem,
that you can learn to feel safe with,

848
00:53:03,300 --> 00:53:08,399
where you can get a feeling of
being accepted, or cherished,

849
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:10,899
where you get a feeling that you're worthwhile,

850
00:53:10,900 --> 00:53:14,399
and that you're important to someone.

851
00:53:14,400 --> 00:53:18,199
You could say the feeding that you didn't get,

852
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:23,799
that something more than bread, when
you were little, you still need to get it.

853
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,599
You still need to be fed with acceptance,

854
00:53:27,600 --> 00:53:30,199
and to find the safety.

855
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:35,700
In other words, knowledge alone is not enough.

856
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:43,300
- Home, Sarge! Home, home!
- Nobody got it.

857
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:49,700
- Get up, get up!
- Get up, get up and go around!

858
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:54,199
<i>Eight weeks have passed.</i>

859
00:53:54,500 --> 00:53:56,699
<i>What about these men?</i>

860
00:53:57,000 --> 00:53:59,799
<i>Are they ready for discharge?</i>

861
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,700
<i>How complete is their recovery?</i>

862
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,999
<i>How about the boy in right field?</i>

863
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,200
I just didn't care what happened to me.

864
00:54:22,600 --> 00:54:25,400
<i>How about the kid at bat?</i>

865
00:54:26,300 --> 00:54:29,499
Foxhole was covered by dirt.

866
00:54:29,500 --> 00:54:33,300
I was covered up for 29 hours
afterwards, until they found me.

867
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:43,100
He's out, he's out, he's out, he's out!

868
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:58,800
Out! Joe, you're out. Joe, you're out. Come on.

869
00:55:00,700 --> 00:55:03,400
<i>How about the umpire?</i>

870
00:55:04,100 --> 00:55:12,500
It's... hard...ha... hard for me to...
get.... get my words... words out.

871
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,399
You're out, go on!

872
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,200
Batter up.

873
00:55:17,300 --> 00:55:19,700
<i>How about this kid?</i>

874
00:55:27,100 --> 00:55:29,300
<i>How about him?</i>

875
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,700
<i>Are they well enough to be discharged?</i>

876
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:53,200
<i>That is for the doctors to
decide at tomorrow's boarding.</i>

877
00:56:03,900 --> 00:56:06,500
<i>The answer is yes.</i>

878
00:56:28,100 --> 00:56:31,999
Men, this is your last military formation.

879
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:34,299
Today you are returning to your homes,

880
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,799
your families, and friends.

881
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:40,099
Many of you have been looking
forward eagerly to this day.

882
00:56:40,100 --> 00:56:42,799
But remember that when
you reenter civilian life,

883
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:47,999
on your shoulders falls much of the
responsibility for the postwar world.

884
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,599
May your lives as civilians be as
worthy as your records as soldiers.

885
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:56,500
Good health, good fortune, and Godspeed.
